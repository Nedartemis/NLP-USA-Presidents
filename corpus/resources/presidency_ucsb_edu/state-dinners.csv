state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"August 21, 1969","
Mr. President, Mrs. Park, all of the distinguished guests in this very distinguished audience tonight:
As I am sure most of you realize, this is an historic occasion not only because of the visit that the President of the Republic of Korea is paying to the United States in an official capacity--because this is the first time in this administration and probably in any administration that a state dinner is being given by the President of the United States for the head of the government of another State, in this case the Republic of Korea, and I am honored that it is in my own State of California and here in the great city of San Francisco.
We have tried to create to an extent the atmosphere which you would find in the White House. The President was pointing out that when he was at the White House at a state dinner there that the audience was not as large, because only 110 could be seated at a White House state dinner.
The wines are from California, the record will show. The flowers are from California, and much of the audience is from California. But the Marine Orchestra, which for 100 years has been the President's orchestra in the White House, was brought from Washington, and the Strolling Strings from the Army came from Washington. We brought them here because we want you to hear them, because one of mine and my wife's most pleasant memories and fondest memories of Korea was in the year 1953 when we became acquainted with the great love of music of the Korean people.
Tonight, in attempting to bring to those in this audience who come from California and all over the Nation something of the feeling of Korea that I have and that l believe the people of the United States do have and should have so they will know the facts, I would like to speak, not simply in my capacity as head of state and head of government, officially welcoming another head of state and head of government, whose friendship we value, but I would like to speak from the hearts of all of the American people to the people of Korea.
And I would like to tell this audience what Korea means, what it means to me, what I think it means to America and to the world.
Korea, first, is a land much like California, a thousand miles of mountains and rivers and valleys. Korea is a land which is very varied in its climate, and in its physical conditions.
Korea, to many in the United States, means a war, a war that was difficult, a war that cost casualties, a war that was controversial. But we should think of Korea tonight in a different sense, because as President Park has often reminded us each time he comes to the United States, he speaks of a different Korea.
Korea today should mean to America and to the world these things: One, it means courage. In all of the world, and I have been to most of the countries of the world, there are no people more courageous than the people of Korea.
They proved their courage fighting for their own freedom in a war that ended 16 years ago. They are proving it by fighting alongside the persons of the United States and those of South Vietnam and other countries in the war in Vietnam with 50,000 Koreans there. And they prove it by maintaining one of the largest armed forces in the world in order to meet the threat which is posed against them in the north.
And this kind of courage Americans admire. Korea means courage, therefore, to us.
Korea also means friendship and alliance in the deepest sense, not the friendship and alliance simply of words, but the friendship and alliance which goes beyond that, and which involves cooperation not just in a war in Vietnam, but in building the new collective arrangements in Asia, which are so important to peace in the Pacific.
And as all of the people in this audience, particularly from California, will realize. peace in the Pacific is essential if we are going to have peace in the world. Because we must remember that the wars that we have been engaged in in the last quarter of a century on three occasions came from the Pacific.
But, finally, Korea today means something else that we need to be reminded of. It means self-reliance. It means self-respect. It means independence. You see it in the faces of the Korean people when you go to that country.
You see it in the faces of that wonderful children's choir, the orphans' choir, when they come to America and sing so beautifully that the tears come to your eyes when you think of what they have been through, and yet how happy they can be despite all that.
And you see it when you realize, as I realized on every occasion today, that Korea is a country which has received aid from the United States, but a country that wants to develop the ability to stand on its own feet. On occasion after occasion, the President and Mrs. Park have expressed the appreciation of the Korean people for the aid they have received from the United States.
And my answer is this: We have aided over 100 countries over the last 25 years. Some of those programs have been successes. More of them have been failures.
But there is one great lesson. All of the aid in the world will not help the people who are unable or unwilling to help themselves. And the people of Korea are not only willing to help themselves, they insist on helping themselves.
And despite their immense military budget, they are developing economically in a remarkably effective way so that the time is now nearing when they will proudly be able to stand on their own two feet economically without any assistance from the United States or any other nation.
So these qualities are what we think of or I think of when I think of Korea: courage, true friendship and alliance, and self-reliance, self-reliance which is so important for the character of a great people.
In proposing a toast to the President of Korea, I have been reminded that there is a saying in Korea which goes like this: The times in which we live are most trying, but may the time come when peace and prosperity will finally come to those thousand miles of mountains and rivers on which we live.
That is what we feel about Korea tonight. We want peace and prosperity for Korea, for all the nations of the world; and, so, from our hearts, I know all will want to join me tonight in raising our glasses to that peace and prosperity for the people of Korea and to the President of Korea and to Mrs. Park--to the President.

state-dinners,Joseph R. Biden,"October 25, 2023","
President Biden. Please have a seat. Thank you.
Well, good evening, everyone. The Prime Minister and I and Jodie and members of the Australian delegation, distinguished guests: Jill and I are honored to welcome you tonight to celebrate the historic bonds between our two nations that's been going on for 72 years now.
An alliance, during World War II, more than 150,000 American troops based in Australia to fight in the Pacific Theater. And to ensure they were prepared to navigate Down Under, they—each one of them was given a manual entitled—and here's what it was entitled, ""Instructions for American Servicemen in Australia."" I'd like to read it. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Albanese. It could be dangerous.
President Biden. Not all of the tips hold up today, but I thought one of them was pretty good, and this is a quote from it: ""You'll find the Australians . . . haven't much respect for stuffed shirts, their own or anyone else's."" [Laughter] Well, I've learned that my trip Down Under as well as becoming friends with the Prime Minister. No wonder we get along so well. [Laughter]
Another tip from the manual not only stands out but stands up, quote: ""Australians have been in all the hotspots wherever the going—whenever the going has been tough."" End of quote. And that's a fact, they have been.
You know, that commitment—[applause]. That commitment to face tough challenges, that courage to fight for a better future, that's what's always brought America and Australia together.
I saw this growing up with my grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan, who lost his son in the Pacific in World War II. He would literally straighten his shoulders every time Australia—the country of Australia—was mentioned. He'd just straighten up, straighten his shoulders.
I saw it when my own son—Major Beau Biden in the National Guard, spent a year in Iraq—told me how he could always count on Aussies to have his back. That's a fact. That's what he had said; he meant it.
And you know, that Ode Remembrance promise: ""At the going down of the Sun and in the morning, we will remember them."" Period. Look, folks, today that bond first forged on the battlefield has grown to capture the full range of human ingenuity. Australian and American workers are building the future together. Australians and American students are innovating together. Australian and American engineers are working together to support Artemis missions to return human beings to the Moon and from there to Mars.
And, as I saw when I visited Australia in 2016, Australians and Americans are driving cutting-edge research to end cancer as we know it—and we will—research that has only grown with Australia teams recently mapping 949 cancer cell lines across 40 types of cancers.
Ladies and gentlemen, a great deal of the history of our world will be written in the Indo-Pacific in the coming years. Australia and the United States must—must—write that story together.
We must continue to advance freedom, security, and prosperity for all; continue the vital work in both our nations of building strong partnerships, of upholding nation-to-nation commitments and—to Native peoples; continue to defend the values of great democracies—freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and freedom from fear; and continue to build a future worthy of our highest hopes even when it's tough—especially when it's tough. For we know that's when it matters the most.
Mr. Prime Minister, today our two nations meet the future, emboldened with a confidence all that's come before. That's what built our confidence: all that has brought us here and all that Australia and America are—innovative, courageous, loyal, unwavering, bold of heart, and resolute of spirit. Determined that tomorrow will be better than today. It will be the most—it will be more than just. It will be more free, more fair, and for all people, because we have the power to make it so.
So please join me if I can get a glass——
[At this point, President Biden was handed a glass.]
Here you go. [Laughter] Please join me in a toast.
To our partnership, our mateship, and the future that we'll create together. Cheers.
[President Biden offered a toast.]
Audience members. Cheers.
President Biden. Mr. Prime Minister, the floor is yours.
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, thank you very much to Mr. President and First Lady Dr. Biden.
I must say I only have one regret about tonight, which is I'm not quite sure how I top this for date night with Jodie—[laughter]—at any time, anywhere in the future. [Laughter] It's all downhill from here, my darling. [Laughter]
Ladies and gentlemen, we live in a world that does keep changing. Yet one thing that keeps the ground firm beneath us is the great constant that is the American spirit.
America has never been held back by the unknown or slowed by trepidation. You stride boldly towards the future, excited by all of its possibility. In every field of human endeavor, your nation is energized by a ceaseless curiosity and the confidence to follow it.
It is a spirit that Australians identify with. With a small population, but a very big imagination, we punch above our weight, all the while drawing inspiration from our friends across the Pacific. We stand as close as we have ever been and, I think, after this week, closer than we have ever been.
We are firm allies strengthening defense cooperation through AUKUS and creating more economic opportunities for our peoples and our region. Australians are always ready to play our part. Most importantly, our nations are close friends, friends who admire each other's qualities. I think we get each other.
And President Biden and I had our first meeting before I'd even selected, of course, a Cabinet. I was elected on the Saturday. And by Monday, I was off to the Quad leaders meeting. And I do want to thank the President for your warm welcome and that rather extraordinary beginning on the front foot in those first days of my government.
Friends who draw strength from all we have in common, but we take joy in our differences as well. Friends who look to the future together without losing sight of the moments in the past that bind us together.
Mr. President speaking as one man with Irish ancestry to another—although I am also, of course, half Italian, so you don't have to guess my religion—[laughter]—I know you won't object to me quoting a Dubliner. The familiar words of William Butler Yeats, ""Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold,"" are now more than a century old. Yet they speak to us just as clearly now as the long contest between democracy and authoritarianism plays out its newest chapter.
But to capture the essence of the bond between our two nations in all of its warmth and its easy strength, I turned to another of his poems: ""Think where man's glory most begins and ends, and say my glory was I had such friends.""
So allow me to make a toast to such friends, because Australia has no greater friend than the United States of America. So, to the President and First Lady, to the history our peoples have made together, but importantly, the future we will build together as a peoples.
To friendship.
[Prime Minister Albanese offered a toast.]
Prime Minister Albanese. Thank you, my friend.
President Biden. Thank you.
Enjoy your meal.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"May 30, 2000","
Mr. President, Mrs. Sampaio, Mr. Prime Minister, members of the Government, members of the diplomatic corps. I would like to thank you, Mr. President, the Government, and the people of Portugal, for the welcome that I and my party have received. I'd like to thank you for the meeting we had today. It has been a pleasure for me to spend time with another President who likes to read detective novels, listen to good music, and play golf. We could have had a 2-day summit on those three topics alone. [Laughter] My staff suggested it so that they could go to the beaches.
Let me say that five centuries ago the vision and courage of Portugal helped Europe to find its way across the Atlantic. You were the first to set foot in South America, to sail down West Africa, to cross the Equator, to round the Cape of Good Hope, to reach India by sea from the west, to trade with China and Japan. It is little wonder then that Portuguese is now spoken by more than 200 million people in countries throughout the world. One of these nations, of course, is the United States.
Two centuries ago Portugal was the very first neutral state to recognize our independence. And as you noted yourself, Mr. President, the United States has been strengthened by the contributions of Portuguese-Americans, from John Philip Sousa, who wrote the music we use to celebrate the Fourth of July, to John Dos Passos, whose voice helped to define America in the 20th century. Today, we are proud to stand with you as partners, allies, and friends.
Twenty-six years ago Portugal turned from dictatorship to democracy. Ten years ago Eastern Europe followed your lead. Today, Eastern Europe is still learning from your example. When finally we build a Europe that is undivided, democratic, and at peace for the first time in history, there will be a great debt owed by all freedom-loving people to Portugal.
Today, this nation that once brought the four corners of the world together is working with its EU allies and America to bring the world together to advance democracy and human rights. Portugal has taken a leading role in NATO and the EU. In Kosovo, nearly half the sorties that led us to victory flew out of Lajes Air Base in the Azores. In East Timor, Portugal's leadership rallied the international community. In Mozambique, our two nations are working together to lead the relief effort. From the Balkans to East Timor to Africa, our troops serve side by side to keep the peace and build a better future.
Here in Portugal, Prime Minister Guterres has charted new ways to solve old challenges and to make the global economy work for all your people. I admire that as well.
Two years ago a Portuguese author was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. A short time later, we in the United States had the honor of hosting Jose Saramago as he received an honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts. Looking out at generations of Portuguese who had traveled to America to enrich our culture and our country, he said that they are a part of an unremitting human chain that has always been and will continue to be an example of living history. That living history links not only past and present but the people of our two countries, from Lisbon and Porto to New Bedford, Fall River, Providence, Newark, all the places Portuguese-Americans have made their own.
Today, we look ahead to a new century. We celebrate our friendship and embrace common challenges. We hope that the values we share will spread across the Earth and bear fruit in more places for more people than ever before. We hope that we will always stand together as friends in the defense of those values and in their advance.
I ask now that all of you join me in a toast to the President of Portugal and Mrs. Sampaio, to the people of this great nation, and to our long friendship.

state-dinners,George W. Bush,"November 06, 2007","
Mr. President, distinguished guests: Laura and I offer you a warm welcome to the White House, or should I say, ""Bienvenue a la Maison Blanche."" [Laughter]
In 1777, another George W. welcomed to America another Frenchman. His name was Lafayette. The two leaders built a strong friendship based on common values and common virtues. They both recognized the power of human freedom. They both served with courage in freedom's cause, and they both anticipated that freedom would advance in other lands following its victory here in America.
Two centuries later, our two nations are honoring the legacy of Lafayette by helping others resist tyranny and terror. French and American troops are helping to defend a young democracy in Afghanistan. Our two nations support the democratic Government of Lebanon. We agree that reconciliation and democracy in Iraq are vital to the future of the Middle East. And our two nations condemn violations of human rights in Darfur, in Burma, and around the world.
France and the United States can meet great challenges when we work together, Mr. President. You and I share a commitment to deepen the cooperation of our two republics, and through this cooperation, we can make the world a better place.
I look forward to our discussions at Mount Vernon, where George Washington welcomed his friend Lafayette. And in the spirit of our friendship, I offer a toast to you and to some of America's oldest friends, the free people of France.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"July 27, 1995","
Let me welcome President and Mrs. Kim, the members of the delegation from the Republic of Korea. To all of our distinguished guests, Hillary and I are delighted to have you here in the White House. I have especially enjoyed this day that I have spent with President Kim, a man whose extraordinary resilience is matched only by his commitment to democracy.
Mr. President, this is our fourth meeting. And if you'll permit me just a personal note, I am struck by how much we have in common. We were both elected to office at an early age. You won a seat in your National Assembly when you were just 25. You entered the Blue House just a month after I came to the White House. Or to put it in another way, we have both spent the past 20,000 hours or so dealing with our respective Congresses and fielding hard questions from the press. [Laughter] I'm happy to say that President Kim is also an enthusiastic jogger who permitted me to jog with him in Korea. And even in this heat, Mr. President, after this meal, we may have to run an extra mile together tomorrow. [Laughter]
Mr. President, for all the things we have in common, I must also comment on something that sets you apart from most other leaders in the world today, and that is the extraordinary hardship you endured and the courage you displayed to bring democracy to your country. Your many years in opposition were marked by jail terms, years of house arrest, an assassination attempt, and a 23-day hunger strike that almost took your life. As you once put it, a short life of integrity is better than a long life in disgrace.
But you persisted, and you prevailed. At your inauguration you said, ""Deep in my heart I have a vision of a new Korea, a freer and more mature democracy. At last we have established a government by the people and of the people of this land."" Now under your leadership, Korea is taking its rightful place in the world as both a thriving economy and a dynamic democracy.
Mr. President, the bonds between our people, forged in the fires of war upon your land, have only grown stronger with time. We are united now by a history of shared sacrifice and a future of common purpose. These are our common goals: lasting peace, security, and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula; a stable and prosperous Asia-Pacific region; a rising tide of democracy around the world. Working together, the Republic of Korea and the United States can help to achieve them.
Mr. President, when I visited you 2 years ago, you presented me with a beautiful work of calligraphy with your favorite saying: Taedo Mumun, Righteousness overcomes all obstacles. Mr. President, tonight, in the presence of so many people from your country, so many Korean-Americans, your wonderful wife, and your two daughters who live in our country, I ask everyone in this room to raise a glass to a man who, through his own righteousness, has overcome all obstacles: Kim Yong-sam. To you, Mr. President, and to the enduring friendship between our two great nations.

We also appreciate the distinction you have bestowed upon us this evening, the Order of the Sikatuna and the Order of Gabriela Silang. We are honored to accept them on behalf of the American people.
I represent the oldest democracy in the Americas. And I'm proud to pay tribute to the oldest democracy in Asia. The friendship between our countries is strong and warm and enduring, and we reaffirm that partnership here tonight.
Today I was the first United States President since Dwight Eisenhower to address a Joint Session of your Congress. In 1960, President Eisenhower expressed America's firm support for a fledgling democracy. Two generations later, I am pleased to show my country's support for the great democracy you have become.
The Philippines and the United States are linked by shared values, by shared history, and by a shared commitment to the defense of liberty. Only a few miles from this palace are the graves of 17,000 Americans who fought for freedom in the Pacific. Their lasting legacy and the legacy of the Filipinos who fought with them is a free and democratic Philippine nation.
Today, free nations are tested once again. Once again, we face determined enemies of freedom, the terrorists and their allies. Once again, we are depending on one another in an hour of need. Once again, we are relying on the strength of the great alliance between our two countries. Once again, we will prevail.
Madam President, I thank you for your friendship and counsel, for your courage and perseverance. And I offer this toast to you, to the great nation of the Philippines, and to the lasting friendship between our two peoples.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"July 01, 2013","
Well, President Kikwete, Madam First Lady, distinguished guests: On behalf of myself and Michelle, our delegation, our daughters, we want to thank you for the incredible warmth and hospitality with which you've greeted us throughout the day. We could not be more grateful.
I am not the first American leader to visit this beautiful country. Other Presidents and prominent citizens have come before me. We just came from South Africa, where Robert Kennedy famously spoke of how every time we stand up for an ideal, we send out a ""tiny ripple of hope."" Less known is that after that trip to South Africa, Robert Kennedy also came here to Tanzania. It was a little different back then. Kennedy and his wife Ethel rode in the back of an open truck. The Secret Service has me and Michelle inside a fortified limousine. We call it the Beast. [Laughter] As Kennedy's truck made its way through the crowds, he picked up two boys and let them ride alongside them. The Secret Service doesn't let me do these things. [Laughter] When Kennedy came, it was a public holiday here. I apologize to Tanzanians that you all had to work today. [Laughter]
But while have—while these times have changed, the good feelings stay the same. We've been deeply touched by the welcome and the warm wishes from the Tanzanian people: along the streets as we came in here, with you tonight. Dar es Salaam means ""harbor of peace,"" and we thank you for sharing that sense of peace and brotherhood for which this country and its people have long been known.
Mr. President, you've shown wisdom and strength in seeking reforms so that more Tanzanians can enjoy progress, more opportunity. And like me, you're strengthened by a woman who is a leader in her own right. I am told that Mama Kikwete is fond of a traditional Tanzanian saying: ""My neighbor's child is my child."" And that sentiment, I think, also captures the feeling the partnership between our two countries must have. We live thousands of miles apart, but as fellow human beings, we share a sense of obligation to each other, especially to the youngest among us.
So you might say an American child is my child. We might say a Tanzanian child is my child. In this way, both of our nations will be looking after all of our children, and we'll be living out the vision of President Nyerere. The core values that he proclaimed for Tanzania also describe what both our countries seek: wisdom, unity, and peace—hekima, umoja, na amani.
So what I'd like to do is to propose a toast, if I can get my water here: To our gracious Tanzanian hosts, to our Tanzanian friends, and to wisdom, unity, and peace that we all seek in the world.
[At this point, a toast was offered.]
Cheers.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"June 27, 1988","
President Reagan. Ladies and gentlemen, I've been told of a Turkish proverb that states: ""A cup of coffee will bear the fruit of 40 years of friendship."" Well, my sense of this expression is that in the give and take of conversation over coffee people establish the sense of caring and loyalty, and of shared hopes and expectations, that define friendship.
Now, Americans and Turks sitting here will soon be sharing a cup of coffee. And earlier today, you and I shared our ideas and our hopes for the United States, for Turkey, and for the partnership between our peoples. And that's why I've long hoped that you would come to the United States, and that's why I'm glad you're here.
But you and I are building on a solid structure. The United States and Turkey have, for more than 40 years, shared much more than a cup of coffee. We've worked together to preserve the integrity of Turkey when it was threatened by aggression in 1947. We've been partners in the world's most successful partnership: the NATO alliance of democracies. Together with our allies, we have withstood aggression and made progress toward peace. Turks and Americans shed blood together in Korea. Americans have been proud to help Turkey in securing its democracy and seeking prosperity.
Our aspirations for our partnership remain large: peace, security, and freedom for our peoples; close cooperation in securing these objectives; and success in defending them. I am confident that 40 years from now Turks and Americans will look back and say that through their friendship Turks and Americans secured for themselves the kind of world we have envisioned together.
And now please join me in a toast to President Evren, to the Turkish-American relationship, and to the friendship between our two peoples. And as you say in Turkish: Serefinize [To your honor].
President Evren. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, distinguished guests: Mr. President, I thank you for your kind remarks. I am indeed moved by them. Our talks today with you and with the distinguished members of your administration have reaffirmed the strength and depth of the bond of friendship which we have continuously developed over the years between our countries. I am most pleased to observe this.
During your administration, Turkish-American relations have gained additional momentum, and the scope of our cooperation has vastly expanded. I am confident that I speak for the Turkish people in stating that we see you not only as a distinguished statesman of our era but also as a good friend of Turkey. We hope that future administrations will carry and further build on the revitalization process in our relations.
The strategic interdependence between our two countries, which we mutually identified almost 40 years ago, retains its validity today. But Turkish-American cooperation rests not only on strategic interests but also on common values embedded in the principles of respect for human rights, freedom, and democracy. We in Turkey are proud that, like other NATO countries with whom we share a common destiny, we have succeeded in establishing a democracy with all its institutions based on respect for human rights. Though this characteristic may not be all that well-known, it is the basis for Turkey's position as an island of peace and stability in a region in turmoil.
Mr. President, we followed with satisfaction and great interest the positive developments at the Moscow summit. It is the hope of Turkish and other peoples that the historical step taken by concluding the INF agreement will be followed by more comprehensive ones in the direction of disarmament. I would like to express my appreciation for this constructive initiative on the part of the United States and the Soviet Union and congratulate you for your tremendous success. We support the efforts of your administration to seek better relations with the Soviet Union without neglecting our defense requirements. It would be a tremendous achievement if, through these efforts, we could leave to future generations a more secure world.
Mr. President, with its present capabilities and future potential, Turkey can become an important economic partner. Internal stability and peace have fostered and sustained high rates of economic growth. This encourages us as we look to the future with confidence for a prosperous Turkey. We consider the economic dimension of our relations with the United States as integral to our traditional friendship and security partnership. Expanded economic cooperation will be an additional source of strength for our political and security relations. That is why we seek more dynamic and comprehensive economic collaboration as part of a multifaceted and therefore more robust relationship. We want our American friends to know of our desire for wide-ranging cooperation in this regard.
Mr. President, I thank you once again for your kind invitation, for the generous hospitality that the American people have extended to us, and for this beautiful evening. And I propose a toast to you; to your charming wife, Mrs. Reagan; and to the continuation of the excellent relations between Turkey and the United States.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"September 17, 2000","
And Mr. Prime Minister, on behalf of the American people, let me welcome you again to the White House, along with all your party from India.
I hope that in your time with us, we have at least come close to repaying the warm hospitality with which you and the Indian people greeted me, my family, and our fellow Americans on my visit in March.
One of the most remarkable things to me about our relationship is its scope and its increasing interdependence. There are hundreds of American businesses, foundations, and universities with long commitments to India. When Americans call Microsoft for customer support today, they're as likely to be talking to someone in Bangalore or Hyderabad as to someone in Seattle.
There are more than one million Indians here in America now, and I think more than half of them are here tonight. [Laughter] And I might say, Prime Minister, the other half are disappointed that they're not here. [Laughter]
Indian-Americans now run more than 750 companies in Silicon Valley alone. In India, the best information available on maternal health and agriculture can now be downloaded by a growing number of villages with Internet hookups. And Indian-Americans can now get on-line with people across the world who speak Telugu or Gujarati or Bengali.
Americans have fallen in love with Indian novels. I'm told that Prime Minister Vajpayee, when he's not writing Hindi poetry, actually likes to read John Grisham. [Laughter] You might be interested to note, Prime Minister, that he's a distant relative of mine. All the Grishams with money are distant relatives of mine. [Laughter]
And don't forget, whether we're in California or Calcutta, we all want to be a crorepati. Now, for the culturally challenged Americans among us, that's from India's version of ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?"" [Laughter]
Of course, our interdependence is about more than commerce and culture. We are also vulnerable to one another's problems, to the shock of economic turmoil, to the plague of infectious diseases, to the spread of deadly military technology, and as we have all too painfully seen, to the terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminals who take advantage of the openness of societies and boarders.
The simple lesson of all this to me, Mr. Prime Minister, is that if we're already all in the same boat together, we had better find a way to steer together. We must overcome the fear some people in both our countries sometimes have, for different historical reasons, that if we meet our friends halfway, somehow it will threaten our own independence or uniqueness.
That is why I am so gratified that, with your leadership and the efforts of so many people in this room, we have together built the strongest, most mature partnership India and America have ever known.
We have so very much more to learn from each other. In both our societies, you can find virtually every challenge humanity knows. And in both our societies, you can find virtually every solution to those challenges: confidence in democracy, tolerance for diversity, a willingness to embrace economic and social change.
So it is more than a slogan for Americans to say that India's success will be our success and that together India and America can change the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you now to join me in a toast to Prime Minister Vajpayee, to the Government and people of India, and the enduring partnership between our two great democracies.

state-dinners,Franklin D. Roosevelt,"December 08, 1942","
Back in March, 1933, there was some talk about our relationship with our neighbors, which I suppose includes not only our farthest neighbors, say in the Argentine, but also the nearest neighbor we have, in Cuba.
Everybody in this country at least, and I think in other parts of the world, appreciated the ideal of the Good Neighbor. But they were words only; the ideal had never been fulfilled. And in the summer of 1933 there were many reasons for it. And then there was serious trouble in our nearest neighbor.
The main point I want to make is that when these troubles occurred in Havana, an unprecedented meeting was called at the Executive Offices. At that meeting we had all the Ambassadors and Ministers of all the American Republics.
And I said to them, speaking as a liberal, and very simply, ""I think the time has come to recognize the practical exposition of the Good Neighbor Policy. I want to take this occasion to tell you that under a somewhat ancient treaty between the United States and Cuba we are compelled by that treaty, known as the Platt Amendment, to go into Cuba—a land of free people, and one we helped to free and set up as a sovereign Nation-and restore order.""
And I said, ""Gentlemen, I am not going to do it. I am not going to apply the Platt Amendment. I am not going to send either the Army or the Navy to restore order in Cuba.""
Well, there was a lifting of eyebrows among a good many of these nineteen other envoys. What is this new President of the United States going to do?
I said, ""I am going to exercise the Good Neighbor Policy, because this is the first chance I have to put it into practical effect. If any Americans want to leave Cuba, they will have every opportunity. If any Americans want to get out, they can go down to the nearest port, and they will find a revenue cutter or a patrol boat of some kind that will take them on board and take them out. I am not going to land a single American soldier or sailor on the soil of the Cubans. I think this is an internal matter, which Cuba is fully competent to settle.""
Well, that was the beginning. I think the Bible says, ""By their fruits shall ye know them.""
And that particular act, throughout all the American Republics, did have an effect, because the United States proved in a practical way that it could apply the doctrine of the Good Neighbor.
Somebody in the paper, a few days ago, called it by a new term, which I think is rather good; he called it not just the policy of the Good Neighbor, but the policy of the Good Partner. In other words, all of these Republics of ours are not just neighbors. We are partners for the common good- all of us.
We are recognizing more and more that the word ""partner"" means that any country—on either hemisphere—cannot be happy and prosperous until all the hemisphere is happy and prosperous; that if one Nation of the 21—of the 22, if we include our neighbor Canada- is unhappy and full of unrest, in a serious depression which affects the lives of all their people, that that affects the happiness and the prosperity of all the other 20, or 21.
And on this dais I see a young man, and I think he had a vision. He was an Army officer, and he took part in that revolution of 1933 in a very modest way. Today the Cuban people are very happy that he is holding the office of Chief Magistrate of the Republic of Cuba.
And so while he is not entirely a stranger with us—he has been here before- we received him as a Major General in command of the Armies of Cuba—we are now very happy to have him come back to us as the President of our nearest neighbor, the Republic of Cuba; and I drink his health.

Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Howard, distinguished guests: Welcome to the White House. This is going to be a joyous occasion because we're honoring two really good friends. We wish you a warm welcome. We thank the Howards for making a long journey, and thanks for spending so much time with us here in the States.
Our partnership is broad, and it's deep. Australia and America are working together to expand trade and to counter threats of nuclear proliferation, to make the latest energy technologies available to all nations. In the global war on terror, we have no better ally than Australia and John Howard. And in the spread of freedom to create lasting peace, we have no better friend than Australia and John Howard.
Mr. Prime Minister, we value your courage and your faithfulness and your strength, and I value your friendship. Laura and I have cherished every visit with you and Janette. We really appreciated the chance to plant those trees yesterday at the Australian Embassy. [Laughter] We wanted to bring a Texas tree up, but they don't grow too well here in Washington. [Laughter] But I know those trees are going to grow strong and sturdy, just like our friendship has grown strong and sturdy.
I was thinking about how to really describe John Howard and his leadership in Australia, and I thought I would remind everybody what Ronald Reagan used to say: it was ""morning in America."" And Mr. Prime Minister, that's still true for our country. We're really an optimistic people, and we firmly believe the best days are ahead for our country. I know you feel the same way about Australia. It's also comforting to know that on the other side of the world, it's already morning in Australia. [Laughter]
Mr. Prime Minister, Laura and I offer a toast to you and Janette, to our allies, and to the great people of Australia.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"August 02, 2016","
President Obama. Good evening, everybody. Nearly 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson welcomed to the White House the first Prime Minister of a newly independent Singapore, a man he hailed as ""a patriot, a brilliant political leader, and a statesman of the New Asia,"" Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. A half century later, Michelle and I are honored to welcome his son: a patriot, a brilliant political leader, and a statesman of a rising, thriving Asia-Pacific. Prime Minister Lee and Mrs. Lee, welcome.
Now, we all know how seriously Singaporeans take their food. [Laughter] In Singapore, even the street vendors—the hawker stalls—earn Michelin stars—[laughter]—which creates some pressure this evening. We have a lot to live up to. We were tempted to offer each of you a ""Singapore Sling"" or some chili crab. However, for those of you who know its unmistakable scent, which never seems to go away, you'll understand why we are not serving a fruit known as durian here in the White House. [Laughter]
With this visit we're celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations between our two nations. Yet even as we mark this anniversary of our formal ties, we honor bonds that stretch back at least 180 years, when Singapore was still a colony and the United States was not far removed from being one ourselves. The first American representative to Singapore was a planter named Joseph Balestier, whose name lives on in one of Singapore's neighborhoods. His wife Maria's legacy lives on in a beautiful church bell that once signaled the evening curfew, and which now rests in Singapore's National Museum, a bell cast in the foundry of Maria's father, Paul Revere. You may have heard of him.
It's a reminder that as we pursue a more peaceful and prosperous order in the Asia-Pacific, our partnership is rooted in more than strategic interests. We're bound together by history, by family, and by friendship. It's the dedication of our men and women in uniform, flying F-15s together across the skies of Idaho. It's the excitement of our students and entrepreneurs, who cross the ocean to learn and to work with each other. And it's the leadership of a son of Singapore who is respected around the world and a trusted partner to the United States.
Prime Minister Lee, when you were sworn in again last year, you spoke of the shared purpose that animates the people of Singapore: ""Each of us giving our best, united by our shared ideals, our faith in this nation, and our belief that here we can build something special together."" What is true of Singapore is true of the relationship between our two countries.
And so as Singapore prepares to celebrate its National Day, and 50 years into a shared journey with the United States, I propose a toast.
[At this point, the President was handed a glass of wine.]
President Obama. Thank you, sir.
To Prime Minister and Mrs. Lee, and to the friendship and partnership between our peoples, let's continue to build something special together. Onward, Singapore—Majulah Singapura. Onward, America. Cheers. Yam seng. [President Obama offered a toast.]
Prime Minister Lee.
Prime Minister Lee. Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I'd like to thank President Obama for his very kind words. Ho Ching and I are delighted to be here. And we are touched by your warm welcome and gracious hospitality. We especially appreciate Mrs. Obama's personal efforts to make our visit a successful one, and for personally overseeing the splendid arrangements for the State Dinner.
Mr. President, when you addressed the U.N. in 2014, you said that ""when nations find common ground, not simply based on power, but on principle, then we can make enormous progress."" And I'm glad to say that tonight, on the 50th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, our two countries share much common ground and have made great progress together based on shared principles, convergent interests, and mutual respect.
I remember my first meeting with you at the Senate. It was May 2007. You were in the midst of a hard-fought Presidential campaign and not yet the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. [Laughter] But I was struck by your focus, your informed interest in Asia, and your desire to cement America's role in it.
Your years growing up in Indonesia gave you direct experience of Southeast Asia's cultures and challenges. As President, your personal leadership and decision to rebalance to Asia has won America new friends and strengthened old partnerships, including with Singapore. Over half a century working together on multiple issues, Singaporeans and Americans have made many enduring and close personal friendships. So I'm happy to see many of Singapore's old friends here tonight, such as Ambassador Steve Green, who you may not know played a crucial role in teeing up a certain midnight golf game between a lame duck President, Bill Clinton, and our Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, on a rainy night in Brunei during an APEC meeting—[laughter]—which led to the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. [Laughter] Which shows what can be done even during lame duck periods. [Laughter]
Singapore admires America's dynamism, vibrancy, and capacity for self-renewal. These qualities attract the best and brightest from around the world. Thousands of Singaporeans study in the U.S., attracted not just by the excellent academic education, but also the unique dynamism of your campuses and the ethos of your society.
This is something that Singapore hopes to emulate as we seek to tap into this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship. The National University of Singapore has set up overseas colleges in Silicon Valley and New York so that our students from Singapore can intern with high-tech startups. And we are also launching a U.S-Singapore 50th anniversary scholarship to promote greater exchanges and understanding between our young people.
America excels not just through sheer individual talent, but by working together with others. At this year's International Mathematics Olympiad, the U.S. team came in top, beating Singapore. [Laughter] And you did so in a remarkable, open, and collaborative manner. You invited students from other competing countries to the U.S. to train with you, including two Singaporeans who benefited from the exposure. It's what globalization means: You compete, but you also cooperate and learn from one another.
In sport, too, some of Singapore's Olympic hopefuls have come to train with America's best athletes. One of our swimmers, Joseph Schooling, is a member of the University of Texas
swim team and was a 2016 NCAA champion in the 100 meters and 200 meters butterfly. And we hope he will do well in Rio.
Our Armed Forces personnel have taken part together in international operations in Afghanistan and in the Middle East. They also train alongside each other on professional courses and joint exercises. I, myself, as a soldier, attending U.S. courses, have personally experienced the dedication, the competence, and the warmth of our hosts. I made good friends, and we still keep in touch after many decades. And they include Frank and Mary McGurk, who were my military sponsors at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas nearly 40 years ago. And they are here tonight.
America is a great nation, not just because of your power and your wealth, but because of your high ideals, openness, and generosity of spirit. You seek to build a world where countries can prosper together. You make common cause with others to fight the problems which plague mankind, be it extremist terrorism, poverty, Ebola, or climate change. That is why 70 years after the Second World War, America is still a welcome power in Asia. We hope these strengths and qualities will be emulated by others and will enable you to remain engaged in our region for many more years.
To mark the 50th anniversary of our relations, Singapore has named an orchid hybrid in honor of President and Mrs. Obama. And this is a hybrid of breeds native to Singapore and Hawaii, where the President was born—most of us believe. [Laughter] We think it's a fitting tribute to America's first Pacific President and a beautiful symbol of the flourishing ties between our countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to the health and success of the President of the United States.
To the President.
[Prime Minister Lee offered a toast.]
Prime Minister Lee. Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"February 03, 1982","
President Reagan. President and Mrs. Mubarak and distinguished guests, tonight we honor a man who has emerged as a source of quiet strength at a time when such traits are sorely needed in the world. He is uncompromising about his principles, and this is something that should be admired.
Years ago, as the superintendent of the Egyptian Air Force Academy, he was asked to bend the rules and permit one student to begin class before all the necessary formalities had been completed. The request was denied. The young man making the request was the brother of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt. This says a lot about the man we honor tonight. It is this dedication to duty, equality before the law and doing the job right, that engenders our respect and our trust.
President Mubarak is now the political leader of a great nation, but his chosen career was that of a military officer. In that profession, he exhibited courage and skill as a pilot, efficiency as an administrator; and this quality now serves his country well.
During our talks today, I could see that what he had learned in the military was deeply ingrained. Like all good military men, President Mubarak understands that the purpose of military power is not to fight, but to keep the peace. Those who must fight when war comes know better than others that peace is not achieved through platitudes or excessive emotion. It requires hard work, resolution, and sacrifice.
In his speech before the Egyptian parliament, President Mubarak said, ""Peace to us is a firm strategic commitment, not a tactical position that can change."" We, today, have rededicated ourselves to that noble goal. What has been accomplished so far is a tribute to the commitment of the Egyptians, the Israelis, and, I think we're all proud to say, the Americans. Our meetings have reassured me that further progress is within our grasp. While it's not easy, progress rarely is.
As a young man, President Mubarak played soccer, and, understandably, he captained his school soccer team. Mr. President, I have to tell you a little story. We're not as familiar with soccer—getting more so in this country; our game of American football has dominated our taste and our thinking for many years. But back some years when soccer was very little known in this country, there was a great football coach named Knute Rockne at Notre Dame University. And he had a turnout of so many men that he knew he would have to dismiss many of them before long, and he decided to kind of accelerate this selection system. So, he got a soccer ball, and he gathered them around, and he said, ""Now, this is a soccer ball."" And he said, ""Just to kind of get started,"" and he said, ""I want you to remember, football is a game that takes courage."" He said, ""I'm going to divide you up into two groups, and then we'll put the ball down between you, and the idea will be to kick the ball—to try to kick it over the other fellows' goal line."" ""Now,"" he said, ""in the course of this, remember, you may have to kick a few shins. But,"" he said, ""remember, football is a game of courage."" And then he looked down, and the ball was gone. And he said, ""Wait a minute. Who took the soccer ball?"" And the littlest guy in the front rank on one side said, ""Never mind the ball, Rock. When do we start kicking?"" [Laughter]
Team sports teaches that winning depends on knowing what's required and working seriously with those seeking the same goal. One also cultivates the concern for others and a respect for playing by the rules. President Mubarak expressed this in his inauguration speech when he stated, ""Freedom means a commitment for freedom to others, and democracy means respect for the legislature and the laws."" Well, these words reflect a world view that is consistent with America's ideals and aspirations as well as, I'm sure, those of his fellow countrymen.
President Mubarak, I look forward to working closely with you as we move toward the goal of establishing a just and lasting peace. Clearly, the Egyptians, Americans, and all the people of the Middle East who seek this goal are on the same team. To succeed we must continue cooperating, and we've already demonstrated cooperation, and cooperation that we thought would have been impossible only a decade ago. But we're doing these things necessary to achieve this goal. We will win the victory we seek. The leadership and quiet strength of the man that we honor tonight makes us all more confident of that.
So, will you all join in a toast to President Mubarak, to Mrs. Mubarak, and to the great people of Egypt.
President Mubarak. I have a card in my pocket. I'll just take it up and read what's written on the card. [Laughter] It's signed by Mrs. Reagan. [Laughter]
President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, dear friends:
Before I start I would like to—let me first congratulate Mrs. Reagan for the new china, which is very elegant and very beautiful.
We are extremely touched by the warmth of your reception. Every time we come here in Washington we are met with open arms and open hearts. Every time I meet with you, Mr. President—although it is the second time, but I could feel that I've met you several times—I feel the depth of your sentiments towards Egypt and the Egyptian people. We too attach great importance to the friendship between our two peoples. We are determined to strengthen the bonds of this friendship and double our cooperation. This is a constant line of our policy.
We appreciate the assistance you have given us without any conditions. Your partnership with us in the peace process is a valuable asset to all parts concerned. It is the pivotal factor for widening the scope of peace to encompass every corner of the region. The talks that we held today, Mr. President, were an added source of satisfaction and reassurance. They reaffirmed our faith in the future, and they reinforced our determination to pursue our goal hand in hand. Together we have made a new beginning. I am certain that it will be recorded in the annals of history as one of the greatest events of our time. And together we shall continue our endeavor until it bears fruit.
I am happy to say that I find President Reagan a statesman of vision and courage. I have no doubt that we will succeed in our endeavor. I realize that the way ahead will not be easy, nor do we. believe that the remaining issues lend themselves to simple solutions. Great is the challenge in front of us, but so is our resolve and determination.
A few days ago President Reagan renewed his commitment to world peace in his State of the Union message. He said that he will strengthen his country's position as a force for peace and progress. He proposed to achieve that by promoting negotiations wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good faith. We support this view.
The United States can make a great contribution to peace through promoting a meaningful and unconditional dialog between Israel and all other parties willing to negotiate. No party should be excluded from this process. A further step in this direction is an American dialog with the Palestinians. This would encourage moderation and rekindle the spark of hope in the hearts of millions of your friends.
Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to invite you to rise in a tribute to our dear friend, President Reagan, and his esteemed spouse, Mrs. Reagan, to each and every American, and ever-growing friendship between our two nations.
Thank you.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"December 07, 1983","
The President. You got mighty quiet all of a sudden. [Laughter]
Well, Your Majesties, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen, today King Birendra and I had the opportunity to review our bilateral relations and to discuss our international concerns. We also had the chance to get to know one another as individuals. I'm pleased to inform you tonight that not only are relations between Nepal and the United States good, but King Birendra and I have each discovered a new friend.
Our discussion of bilateral relations revealed a refreshing lack of difficulties. Notwithstanding the great distance that separates our two nations, Nepal and the United States through the years have enjoyed a particularly amicable relationship. We prefer to think of you, Your Majesties, as neighbors on the other side of the world. We're so pleased that you've made this neighborly visit. It will serve to expand the good will between our peoples when more Americans, as I did today, get the chance to meet you personally.
Americans respect individuals of courage and conviction. And to give you some idea of how this applies to King Birendra, one of His Majesty's many talents is parachuting. We have a great deal in common— [laughter] —but let me hasten to say we found our common ground in another of his interests-horseback riding. [Laughter]
Your Majesty, the highest mountain on our planet, Mount Everest, is in Nepal. So are 8 of the world's 10 highest peaks. And the character of your people, the sincerity of your convictions stand as tall and strong as your mountains.
Any American who's visited Nepal returns home in awe, not only of the majestic beauty of your land but also of the religious strength of your people. There are countless religious shrines in Nepal—outward symbols of your country's greatest strength. And, Your Majesty, this spiritual side which is so important to your nation speaks well of you and your countrymen.
Today we had the opportunity to discuss a proposal of which you and your people can be rightfully proud. Through the Nepal Zone of Peace concept, you're seeking to ensure that your country's future will not be held back by using scarce resources for military purposes. We Americans support the objectives of Your Majesty's Zone of Peace proposal, and we endorse it. We would only hope that one day the world in its entirety will be a zone of peace.
In the meantime, we encourage you to continue to work closely with your neighbors to make Nepal's Zone of Peace a reality. Your innovative approach to peace and development could be a foundation for progress throughout the region. We wish you success.
It is an honor to have you with us, Your Majesties. Now, would all of you please join me in a toast to His Majesty, King Birendra, to Her Majesty, Queen Aishwarya, and to the people of Nepal.
The King. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I'm touched by your cordial welcome and the warm words with which you and Mrs. Reagan have received us here in Washington. We're equally honored by the generous remarks you, Mr. President, have just made about my country and people.
Seen from Washington, Nepal is almost on the other side of the globe, and yet, as this friendly gathering here tonight shows, distance notwithstanding, friendship and cordiality based on shared ideals can exist between countries that are geographically far apart. In 1947, as soon as Nepal broke her age-old isolation by seeking friendship beyond her borders, it was with the United States of America that Nepal sought to establish her diplomatic relations.
Since 1951, the year when my grandfather, late King Tribhuvan, led the Nepalese people to democracy, we have looked to the United States as a land of freedom and fulfillment. The enduring ideals of the Founding Fathers of America, who spoke to men of liberty and independence, have inspired men throughout the world, including those of us living in the mountain fastness of Nepal.
In our part of the world, if America is looked upon as a land of gold, grain, and computers, a country of skyscrapers and space shuttle, she is also regarded as a nation committed to respect man and his dignity. A land of discovery, America has distinguished herself in being inventive, in breaking new grounds, and opening newer horizons of knowledge for the betterment of man.
With a country such as the United States, one wonders if Nepal has anything in common. On the surface, there may seem very little. Yet, as men living in the same planet, we have common stakes in the global peace, prosperity, and, indeed, the survival of man in dignity and freedom.
We're happy to see, Mr. President, your efforts to maintain peace and stability around the world. The Nepalese people join me in appreciating the understanding with which on behalf of the people and the Government of the United States you have extended support to the concept of Nepal as a Zone of Peace. This recognition, I assure you, will go down not only as an important landmark in the history of our relations but also as a testimony of your personal commitment to the cause of peace, stability, and freedom.
Nepal rejoices in the achievements of the American people in different fields of human endeavors. The initiative and enterprise of your people are exemplary. Yet, what happens in this part of the world sends its ripples even to the roadless villages of Nepal. We receive their fallout. When America suffers a temporary drought, millions around the world get affected.
Indeed, if I may seek your indulgence, I would like to mention something that on the surface may sound trivial, but sometimes it is the small thing that can bring about profound changes. The corn maize in Nepal was introduced from this part of America, as were the potatoes from the Andes nearly 300 years ago. These new crops not only altered our hill economy but even the mode of life, by making settlements possible in the mountain terraces of Nepal.
Evidently, we do not live in islands, but in a world bound in a nexus of interdependence. What happens in America ceases, therefore, to be a local event. The United States as such has shown a consistent understanding towards this and has assisted Nepal in stretching her hand of friendship and cooperation in many fields, including the building of infrastructures.
May I take this opportunity, therefore, to thank you, and through you, to the people and Government of the United States for the support we have received in meeting the challenges of development in Nepal.
Mr. President, in recent years, America has brought glory to humanity by landing man on the Moon. It is indeed thrilling to reflect that one can soar into space to explore the unknown and scan the stars. Yet these adventures into outer space would carry still deeper meaning if the part of humanity living in Nepal could also rid themselves of their continuing poverty. Herself, a least developed, land-locked country, Nepal has always sought understanding and cooperation from our friends and neighbors. In fact, since the time I assumed responsibilities, I have sought that the minimum of basic needs must not be denied to people anywhere in the world. In this regard, I take comfort in the reassurance that the United States will continue to extend cooperation on a long-term basis into the future.
Modern technology, Mr. President, has reduced distance and joined us all into a family of nations. This situation demands that we create an enduring relationship based on a sense of purpose and meaning. With Nepal and countries in her region willing to join hands with the United States and other international agencies in a creative effort for prosperity by putting into use a fragment of their human and capital resources to harness the water potentials of Nepal, it would not only enable them to walk over a long road to progress for our region, as a whole, but would also continue to build bridges of understanding between a most advanced and a least developed nation of the world. It would also mean eliminating the perils of hunger on the one hand, and the danger of instability and extremism on the other.
I have no doubt that Nepal and the United States can cooperate in many fields of creative endeavors. As countries that have shown respect to the uniqueness of the individual, we believe in the conservation of the natural as well as the spiritual heritage of man. But most important of all, we both honor the freedom of man and the independence of nations. In this regard, we appreciate the support the United States has shown consistently to our identity as a nation.
Mr. President, I cherish the fruitful exchange of views we have had recently with each other. You have been very reassuring, and I wish to thank you and Mrs. Reagan for the warmth of hospitality shown to me, my wife, and members of my entourage.
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, may I now request you to join me in proposing a toast to the health and happiness of President Ronald Reagan of the United States of America, and the First Lady, Mrs. Nancy Reagan, to the peace and prosperity of the American people, and to the further development of friendship between Nepal and the United States.
Thank you.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"February 05, 1998","
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening, and welcome to the White House. To Prime Minister and Mrs. Blair, members of the British delegation, to all our distinguished guests, let me say that the bad news is you have to listen to two brief toasts; the good news is it comes at the beginning of the dinner. We are delighted to have all of you here.
Tonight, in honor of the Prime Minister's visit, I would like to go over some of the highlights of the so-called special relationship between the United States and Great Britain. It began rather early in our history, this special relationship. [Laughter] In 1785 Thomas Jefferson, soon to be our first Secretary of State, insisted that the United Kingdom was an evil empire whose time was running out. [Laughter] ""The sun of her glory is fast descending to the horizon,"" he said, with uncharacteristic myopia.
In 1814 marauding English soldiers gave new meaning to the term ""global warming"" when they torched the White House where we sit tonight—[laughter]—along with much of the surrounding countryside. My predecessor James Madison was lucky to escape with very few belongings and a chastened view of our defense capabilities.
But Mr. Prime Minister, we are a forgiving people. And we learned a valuable lesson on that night in 1814: From now on, let's get these guys on our side. That's been the core of our foreign policy ever since. [Laughter]
When we think over the challenges of the 20th century, it's extraordinary what our two nations have been through together, decade after decade, staring down the darkest threats in the history of humankind. We would not have survived this turbulent century without the grand alliance joining our peoples. Through common values and a common language, we have forged an uncommon friendship.
Let me take this opportunity to announce that in honor of your visit, the place where you and Cherie are staying will now be forever known as Blair House. [Laughter]
Tonight we look forward to a new millennium and a 21st century alliance for peace, prosperity, and progress. We have a rare chance to bring fruition to a century's worth of partnership. We can define the new century before it begins, escaping the 20th century's darkest moments and seizing the new century's most brilliant possibilities. We can stand together against tyrants. We can help peace flourish from Bosnia to Northern Ireland to the Middle East. We can continue to open our minds, our hearts, our societies to new ideas and new possibilities.
Mr. Prime Minister, you are breathing new life into politics and restoring faith in ancient principles of liberty so dear to every citizen of your realm. Throughout our history, our peoples have reinforced each other in the living classroom of democracy. It is difficult to imagine Jefferson, for example, without John Locke before him, difficult to imagine Lincoln without knowing that he read Shakespeare and Bunyan on the frontier.
In the new century, we must continue together undaunted—in the words of the Anglo-American poet W.H. Auden, ""never beleaguered by negation, always showing an affirming flame."" One of our most stubbornly affirmative Presidents, Harry Truman, felt that way. It's a rather closely guarded secret that this hard-nosed Missourian was shamelessly devoted to 19th century English sentimental poetry. When he graduated from high school in 1901, at the dawn of the new century, Harry Truman copied his favorite poem onto a piece of paper. Throughout his life, he kept it with him, which required him to recopy it at least 20 times. Tennyson's ""Locksley Hall"" may seem an unusual choice, but the poem resonated with Truman's optimistic vision of the future, a future that then, as now, was limitless.
With a new century beginning, ""Locksley Hall"" still holds the promise of a better life for those of us glimpsing the new world just over the horizon: ""For I dipped into the future, far as human eye could see, saw the vision of the world and all the wonder that could be."" We must realize the promise of that poem.
Our alliance is strong. Our personal friendship is strong. It is a pleasure and an honor for Hillary and for me to reciprocate the hospitality that you, Mr. Prime Minister and Cherie, showed to us last May. And so I ask you all, ladies and gentlemen, to join me in raising a glass to my good friend the Prime Minister of Great Britain, to Cherie, and all the people who are here with them, who represent the best promise of our tomorrows.
[At this point, the President toasted the Prime Minister.]
Thank you.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"August 05, 1981","
President Reagan. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we welcome a man who leads a nation recognized for its magnificent contributions to mankind. His depth of character and hard-won accomplishments suggest that Egypt's contributions will not be limited to those of antiquity. In the recent past, there have been few foreign leaders who have truly captured the hearts of the American people. And Anwar Sadat is one of those rare exceptions.
Historians often argue about whether events are shaped by people or people by events. There's little doubt that the man we honor this evening is an individual who shaped history. President Sadat, Mrs. Sadat, it's truly an honor to have you with us.
Now, Mr. President, I know that you struggled many years and played a prominent role in creating an organization which brought independence to your country. But then on the night of the revolution, when it actually began, you were in a movie theater watching a picture with your family. Now, you wouldn't by chance remember who happened to be in that movie, would you? [Laughter] I never won an Oscar, but a revolution would do. [Laughter]
But seriously, those charged with enormous responsibility are, after all, people and must have a very human quality of flowing with events. Nevertheless, some, like the man we honor tonight, do more than live through history; they make it. You, Mr. President, could have let the flow of events continue unchecked. Instead, with brilliant insight, you recognized an opportunity and seized the moment.
During your historic journey to Jerusalem you explained, ""There come moments when it becomes imperative for those endowed with wisdom and lucidity of vision to penetrate beyond the past with all its complications and vestiges to usher in an undaunted move toward new horizons."" Well, more than wisdom, it takes courage to make fundamental decisions—the kind that you, Mr. President, talked about.
Time and time again, he has demonstrated that vital courage as well as a majestic sense of decency and dedication to universal human principles. Instead of pounding on podiums and romanticizing the illusionary glory of conflict, President Sadat set goals for his people of peace, prosperity, and freedom. As your people have strived for these ends, Americans and Egyptians have unavoidably been drawn together-unavoidably, because we share the same goals. And as many who have visited both nations point out, we, the Egyptians and the Americans, are similar people. Certainly our love of freedom and independence unites us.
In a passage reminiscent of our own Thomas Jefferson, President Sadat penned his definition of freedom in his autobiography. ""Freedom,"" he said, ""is the most beautiful, holy, and precious fruit of our culture. An individual should never be made to feel that he's at the mercy of any force or coercion or that his will is subordinated to that of others.""
Well, we're grateful to have in Egypt a full partner in achieving our mutual goals, which includes our common determination to making the blessings of peace available to all the people of the Middle East. We will sincerely endeavor to help where possible, and we want you to know that all of your efforts, your forbearance in times of frustration, and, most of all, your good will, is appreciated. You're following a path that is natural for us. You've said, ""No man can be honest with others unless he is true to himself.""
The ancient pharaohs built pyramids to their glory. Your monuments are strong and healthy young men, alive today because you pursued peace—symbols to all mankind that there is a better way.
So, I ask all of our friends who are with us here tonight to join me in a toast to the Egyptian people and to their gallant President and his lovely wife.
President Sadat. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, dear friends:
We are overwhelmed by your genuine hospitality and warmth.
The sentiments President Reagan expressed toward me and the Egyptian people clearly reflect the bonds of friendship and amity which exist today between our nations. For years we worked hand in hand to set our relations on the course which is compatible with the long history of mutual respect and admiration between our peoples. We are determined to cement this friendship even further.
Our meeting today was a historic one by any measure. Let me state first that I was delighted to meet you, Mr. President, and strike an everlasting friendship with you. You are a statesman of conviction and compassion. You have a clear vision of the world and our duty to make if safer and happier for the living generations and those to come. Your priorities are rightly set. I was pleased that we are in full agreement over the issues we discussed.
Your nation, Mr. President, has played a pivotal role to bring about peace in the Middle East. No progress, as I told you in the morning, Mr. President, would have been made without such an active and dynamic role; no result would have been achieved. But with your help we have taken gigantic steps on the road to peace.
When we launched our peace initiative, we had in mind the support of the American people. And as we prepare for the second stage, we count on your continued interest and backing. Together we shall continue to work vigorously until the sacred mission is fulfilled. What I heard from you today, Mr. President, was very encouraging indeed.
We believe that the time is right for the resumption of the peace process. Recent events in the area demonstrated beyond any doubt that we cannot wait long if we are to spare the region further destruction and devastation. We must take additional steps promptly and without delay in order to maintain the momentum for peace. We are determined to complete our mission. We will not be deterred or discouraged by any development.
A new initiative, Mr. President, a bright side of this event was the willingness of the Palestinians to accept a cease-fire in Lebanon and uphold it. This is a turning point that should not escape our notice. In effect, it means that for the first time the Palestinians have come close to endorsing the peaceful solution. Those who are genuinely interested in peace in the Middle East should recognize this positive development and build upon it for the good of all nations.
At the same time, this is an added ammunition for our goal for mutual and simultaneous recognition between the Israelis and the Palestinians. As I have repeatedly said, the answer to persisting fears and suspicions is a real willingness to coexist and live together as good neighbors. We have set a good example with the establishment of peace between Egypt and Israel within the context of a comprehensive settlement. That model applies to the relations between Israel and the other parties.
You can help this process of reconciliation, Mr. President, by holding a dialog with the Palestinians through their representatives. This is certain to strengthen the forces of moderation among them. It would also undermine the designs of those who exploit the present state of affairs for their own selfish ends. It would be an act of statesmanship and vision.
If we succeed to achieve tangible progress with respect to the Palestinian problem, a whole new situation will emerge. We will be able to confront the real challenges we face. They are challenges which involve the survival of many nations and the protection of the vital interests of the West. I am confident that we will meet these challenges decisively and without hesitation.
I came here hopeful and optimistic, Mr. President. After our first session, I have become most confident and certain, under your upright and under your inspiring leadership, this great country can realize its dreams and reach its goals.
On behalf of the Egyptian people, I invite you, Mr. President, and your family to visit Egypt. This will give our people an opportunity to express to you directly their feelings of gratitude and respect. Such a visit will also serve the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East. It will enable us to pursue this stimulating dialog and bolster the bonds of friendship and mutual understanding.
Dear friends, allow me to invite you to rise in a tribute to President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, and the friendly people of the United States.
Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"February 11, 1985","
The President. Your Majesty and distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House.
It was my honor today to renew my friendship with King Fahd. And when we last met in Cancun, it was a bit warmer, but, Your Majesty, I only hope the warmth of our hospitality helps make up for the coldness outside.
I'd like to take this opportunity, Your Majesty, to thank you for a piece of cutlery. It's a fine, jeweled saber that I received as a gift from the Saudi Boy Scouts who visited the White House last year. And with the budget battle about to commence in Washington, it's going to come in very handy. [Laughter]
King Fahd and the Saudi Royal Family, reflecting the values at the heart of their society, have been sharing and generous leaders. In addition to their humanitarian aid throughout the world, they contribute to such cultural and educational institutions as the American University in Beirut, for example. And closer to home, when fire destroyed a major cultural facility at Wolf Trap here in Washington, threatening to short-circuit an entire theatrical season, the Saudi Embassy quickly located a huge tent and had it flown to Washington, and the show went on. In 1977 Terraset Elementary School in Reston, Virginia, received a solar heating system dedicated by none other than our guest of honor this evening.
King Fahd's exuberance for getting involved is well known. He's maintained the rich tradition of the majlis [council], meeting directly with his people, listening to their ideas as often as not to their problems.
His personal identification with his people has manifested itself in his avid support for Saudi Arabia's soccer team. And, Your Majesty, I understand that you have, on occasion, gone so far as to call the coach and offer suggestions. [Laughter] Being a former radio sportscaster, I'd love to do that. However, in this country, they only permit me to call them after the game is over. [Laughter]
But there's an Arab saying: The sands are blowing. And I submit to you, King Fahd, that if the sands of time give us any hint of the future, it is that in the days ahead the friendship between the Saudi Arabian and American people will be a strong and vital force in the world and that the future of the Middle East is one of peace.
Your Majesty, it's been an honor for us to have you as our guest. I look forward to building on what we've accomplished today.
The King. Mr. President, dear friends, I am pleased indeed this evening to hear these valuable words, these precious words from my good friend, His Excellency, President Reagan.
And on this good occasion, I would like to give my greetings to Mrs. Reagan and all the friends that are assembled here once again.
I was indeed happy when I heard the President is following the news of sports in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. [Laughter] As a matter of fact, just exactly as the President said, this is true, because I follow the news of sports in my country, and, therefore, the Saudi soccer team was first among all the Asian countries and became the only candidate as far as a candidate for the Olympics in Los Angeles this past summer. The Saudi soccer team came to Los Angeles, but it was not lucky enough in order to win any medals. But the most important thing is that the team participated in Los Angeles, and it showed the world that Saudi Arabia cares about athletics and sports. And the team found all kinds of reception and greetings from this good people in the United States.
And, also, a couple of months ago, the team won the Asian Cup among some Asian countries that have had soccer and practiced the game of soccer for 100 years before Saudi Arabia. [Laughter] The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia took up soccer only about 20 years ago, or maybe less, and won the Asian Cup, rightfully so. [Laughter] And, of course, in such matches nobody takes into consideration the good feelings of the other. You play to win— [laughter] —so much so that one of the Asian countries that played against Saudi Arabia said that their team was going to win the cup. As a matter of fact, they even reserved a special desk on the plane for that cup. [Laughter] We did not claim that we were going to win the cup, but the Saudi team won two cups instead of one— [laughter] —the African Cup and also the goalie won the cup for the most valuable player or the best goalie in those games and tournaments.
Of course, in the past, only 5 years ago, we were defeated. As a matter of fact, I have adopted sports in my country, not only soccer but many other sports and athletics. Now we have 125 athletic clubs. Those clubs practice all kinds of sports, including soccer. And we also hope that we will be able to participate in many international tournaments in the future.
The day before yesterday, the Saudi youth group, those who are under 16, won the cup for the youth under 16 years old. And the tournament for the Asian and African games will be held in China next year. And the Saudi team is going to go in order to play. And, of course, we think this is a very good thing that it has already defeated the similar teams in Asia and now it is going to China in order to defeat other, more powerful teams. [Laughter]
Furthermore, there is another soccer team for those who are 18- or 19-year-olds. It has won all the tournaments, and there are only four countries left that it is going to face. And we believe that we are going to defeat those also. [Laughter] When this takes place in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, and faces those four countries, it will go to Moscow. We don't know whether the members of the team will come back as Communists to us or not. [Laughter] But I believe that our team will meet millions of Muslims there in the Soviet Union, so I don't know whether the Soviets will allow the Saudi flag to flutter and to be raised, because the wordings on the flag says, ""There is no God but the God and Mohammed is His only Prophet."" What is important, that we are going to have matches in China and in Moscow. If this proves anything, it proves that the level of sports in Saudi Arabia is rather good.
And in conclusion, before I finish what I have to say with these limited remarks, I would like to thank His Excellency, my friend, President Reagan, and Mrs. Reagan and all my dear friends assembled here.
I don't know whether His Excellency, the President, realizes that at the present there are some 500 American companies working in Saudi Arabia, doing business. If this is of any indication, it also indicates the close ties of friendship that exist between our two countries. And furthermore, the Saudi-American Commission [U.S.-Saudi Joint Economic Commission] did its duty, and it holds its meetings regularly, once in Saudi Arabia and once in the United States in a regular manner. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the officials in this Commission, be they Americans or Saudis, because they have accomplished many of the important projects, and also those companies that contributed greatly to our progress, and among them, many American companies.
Therefore, what I would like to say, that there are many levels of relationships between our two countries. Be they political, economic, or social, they all indicate the strong ties of friendship between our two countries.
When we are in need of any product that is produced by the United States, be it in the field of technology or otherwise, that means we are in need of this, and we will work to get it. The reason we try to acquire these things, because we consider ourselves as friends of the United States. Our aim, of course, is we want peace and stability for our region in the Middle East, and we want for all people to live in peace.
I forgot to mention something important earlier, and that is that we have about 13,000 of our sons that are studying in American colleges and universities. And they all find very good treatment. I am sure that some of them are probably—who have study in the United States, and they are here this evening. My sons studied in the United States, four of them. And they received their B.A. degrees from American universities. And I have now my young Aziz, Prince 'Abd al 'Aziz. When he is older, he will go to a university. Therefore, I have an interest here in the United States, because my sons graduated from American colleges and universities.
I hope that this friendship will continue, because it was built on firm and sound foundations.
And in conclusion, I would like to thank President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan, again, and all my friends here. And I would like for anybody who wishes to visit Saudi Arabia—you are all welcome to come and see my country. And at this moment, I would like to invite President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan. For any time they wish to come and visit Saudi Arabia, they will find a friendly people there to welcome them.
Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"March 10, 2016","
President Obama. Good evening, everybody. Bonsoir. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House as we host Prime Minister Trudeau, Mrs. Grégoire-Trudeau, and the Canadian delegation for the first official visit and state dinner with Canada in nearly 20 years. Now, we intend to have fun tonight. But not too much. [Laughter] If things get out of hand, remember that the Prime Minister used to work as a bouncer. [Laughter] This is true. [Laughter]
So tonight history comes full circle. Forty-four years ago, President Nixon made a visit to Ottawa. And he was hosted by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. [Applause] That deserves a toast. At a private dinner, there was a toast. ""Tonight we'll dispense with the formalities,"" President Nixon said. ""I'd like to propose a toast to the future Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Pierre Trudeau."" [Laughter] He was 4 months at the time. [Laughter]
All these years later, the prediction has come to pass. Mr. Prime Minister, after today, I think it's fair to say that, here in America, you may well be the most popular Canadian named Justin. [Laughter] It's possible.
I said this morning that Americans and Canadians are family. And tonight I want to recognize two people who mean so much to me and Michelle and our family. First of all, my wonderful brother-in-law, originally from Burlington, Ontario, Konrad Ng. Hey, Konrad! This is actually an interesting story, though, that I was not aware of: Konrad indicated to me when we saw each other this afternoon that part of the reason his family was able to immigrate to Canada was because of policies adopted by Justin's father. And so had that not happened, he might not have met my sister, in which case, my lovely nieces might not have been born. [Laughter] So this is yet one more debt that we owe the people of Canada [Laughter] In addition, a true friend and a member of my team who has been with me every step of the way—he is from Toronto and Victoria—and also a frequent golf partner: Marvin Nicholson. So as you can see, they've infiltrated all of our ranks. [Laughter]
Before I ever became President, when we celebrated my sister and Konrad's marriage, Michelle and I took our daughters to Canada. And we went to Burlington and—this is always tough—Mississauga. [Laughter] And then, we went to Toronto and Niagara Falls. [Laughter] Mississauga. I can do that. [Laughter] And everywhere we went, the Canadian people made us feel right at home.
And tonight we want our Canadians friends to feel at home. So this is not a dinner, it's supper. [Laughter] We thought of serving up some poutine. [Laughter] I was going to bring a two-four. [Laughter] And then, we'd finish off the night with a double-double. [Laughter] But I had to draw the line at getting milk out of a bag—[laughter]—this we Americans do not understand. [Laughter] We do, however, have a little Canadian whiskey. That we do understand. [Laughter]
This visit has been a celebration of the values that we share. We, as a peoples, are committed to the principles of equality and opportunity, the idea that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can make it if you try, no matter what the circumstances of your birth, in both of our countries.
And we see this in our current Presidential campaign. After all, where else could a boy born in Calgary grow up to run for President of the United States? [Laughter] Where else would we see a community like Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, welcoming Americans if the election does not go their way? [Laughter] And to the great credit of their people, Canadians from British Columbia to New Brunswick have, so far, rejected the idea of building a wall to keep out your southern neighbors. [Laughter] We appreciate that. [Laughter] We can be unruly, I know.
But, on a serious note, this visit reminds us of what we love about Canada. It's the solidarity shown by so many Canadians after 9/11 when they welcomed stranded American travelers into their homes. It's the courage of your servicemembers, standing with us in Afghanistan and now in Iraq. It's the compassion of the Canadian people welcoming refugees, and the Prime Minister himself, who told those refugees, ""You're safe at home now.""
Justin, we also see Canada's spirit in your mother's brave advocacy for mental health care, and I want to give a special welcome to Margaret Trudeau tonight. And we see Canada's spirit in Sophie, a champion of women and girls, because our daughters deserve the same opportunities that anybody's sons do.
And this spirit reminds us of why we're all here, why we serve. Justin, Sophie, your children are still young. They are adorable, and they still let you hug them. [Laughter] When we first spoke on the phone after your election, we talked not only as President and Prime Minister, but also as fathers. When I was first elected to this office, Malia was 10 and Sasha was just 7. And they grow up too fast. This fall, Malia heads off to college. And I'm starting to choke up. [Laughter] So I'm going to wind this—it was in my remarks—[laughter]—and I didn't—I can't do it. It's hard. [Laughter]
But there is a point to this, though, and that is that we're not here for power. We're not here for fame or fortune. We're here for our kids. We're here for everybody's kids: to give our sons and our daughters a better world; to pass to them a world that's a little safer and a little more equal and a little more just, a little more prosperous, so that a young person growing up in Chicago or Montreal or on the other side of the world has every opportunity to make of their life what they will, no matter who they are or what they look like or how they pray or who they love.
Justin, I believe there are no better words to guide us in this work than those you once used to describe what your father taught you and your siblings: to believe in yourself. To stand up for ourselves. To know ourselves and to accept responsibility for ourselves. To show a genuine and deep respect for each other and for every human being.
And so I would like to propose a toast: to the great alliance between the United States and Canada; to our friends, Justin and Sophie; to the friendship between Americans and Canadians and the spirit that binds us together, a genuine and deep and abiding respect for each and every human being. Cheers.
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. Dear friends, Mr. President, Barack, Michelle, all of you gathered here, it is an extraordinary honor for me to be here with you tonight. Thank you so much for the warm welcome you've extended to Canada and to the Canadian delegation and to Sophie and me, personally.
It's incredibly touching to be able to be here not just as a couple, Sophie and I, but to have been able to bring our families down as well. Sophie's mom and dad, Estelle and Jean—get a load of Estelle, I'm looking forward to the future with Sophie. [Laughter] And of course, my own mother Margaret, whose last state dinner here was in 1977. So it's wonderful to have you here.
It's also touching to meet Malia and Sasha, who are here at their first State Dinner. And quite frankly, the memories for me of being a kid and not being old enough to attend these kinds of events with my father almost makes me wish I had gone through my teenage years as a child of a world leader, but not quite. [Laughter] I admire you very much, both of you, for your extraordinary strength and your grace, through what is a remarkable childhood and young adulthood that will give you extraordinary strength and wisdom beyond your years for the rest of your life. The one thing that you have received from your extraordinary parents is the tools to be able to handle the challenges and the opportunities in front of you. So thank you very much for joining us tonight.
In thinking about what I wanted to say this evening, I came across a quote from President Truman, who shared these words with the Canadian Parliament nearly 70 years ago. He said that Canada's relationship with the United States did not develop spontaneously. It did not come about merely through the happy circumstance of geography, but was ""compounded of one part proximity and nine parts good will and common sense.""
It is that enduring good will and common sense that I believe defines our relationship to this day. It's what makes our constructive partnership possible. It's what allows us to respectfully disagree and remain friends and allies on the few occasions we do. For example, I would argue that it's better to be the leader of a country that consistently wins Olympic gold medals in hockey. [Laughter] President Obama would likely disagree. And yet you still invited us over for dinner. [Laughter] Because that's what friends do. [Laughter]
Because, now that I think of it, we're actually closer than friends. We're more like siblings, really. We have shared parentage, though we took different paths in our later years. We became the stay-at-home type—[laughter]—and you grew to be a little more rebellious. [Laughter] But I think the reason that good will and common sense comes so easily is because we are, Canadians and Americans alike, guided by the same core values. Values like cooperation and respect. Cooperation because it keeps us safe and prosperous. And respect because it's the surest path to both safeguarding the world we share and honoring the diverse people with whom we share it.
When it comes to security, for example, we agree that our countries are stronger and the world is safer when we work together. For more than half a century, we've joined forces to protect our continent. And we've been the closest of allies overseas for even longer, fighting together on the beaches of France, standing shoulder to shoulder with our European partners in NATO, and now confronting violent extremism in the Middle East.
In every instance, we realize that our concerns were better addressed together than alone, and together, we have realized the longest, most peaceful, and most mutually beneficial relationship of any two countries since the birth of the nation state. It's a relationship that doesn't just serve its own interests, it serves the entire world. Canadians and Americans also value economic interdependence, because we know that it brings greater prosperity for all of us.
Over $2.4 billion worth of goods and services cross the border every day, evidence of one of the largest and most mutually beneficial trading relationships in the world. And one of your—our most popular exports to the United States, and I need you to stop teasing him, has been another Justin. [Laughter] Now—no, no, that kid has had a great year. [Laughter] And of course, leave it to a Canadian to reach international fame with a song called ""Sorry."" [Laughter]
Together, Canada and the U.S. negotiated trade agreements that have expanded opportunities for our businesses, created millions of good, well-paying jobs for our workers, and made products more affordable for more Canadian and American families. We must never take that partnership for granted, and I can promise you that my government never will.
But nor should we forget that our responsibilities expend—extend beyond our own borders and across generations, which means getting rid of that outdated notion that a healthy environment and a strong economy stand in opposition to one another. And it means that when we come to issues like climate change, we need to acknowledge that we are all in this together. Our children and grandchildren will judge us not by the words we said, but by the actions we took or failed to take.
If we truly wish to leave them a better world than the one we inherited from our own parents—and I know, Mr. President, that you and the First Lady want this as strongly as Sophie and I do—we cannot deny the science. We cannot pretend that climate change is still up for debate.
[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no translation was provided. He then continued in English as follows.]
Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership—your global leadership—on the pressing issue of the environment and climate change.
And finally, we believe—Canadians and Americans—in the fundamental truth that diversity can be a source of strength, that we are thriving and prosperous countries not in spite of our differences, but because of them. Canadians know this. It's why communities across the country welcomed more than 25,000 Syrian refugees over the past 4 months and not as visitors or temporary citizens, but as Canadians. But of course, Americans understand this too. It's why each generation has welcomed newcomers seeking liberty and the promise of a better life. It's what has made America great over the past decades.
We know that if we seek to be even greater, we must do greater things: be more compassionate, be more accepting, be more open to those who dress differently or eat different foods or speak different languages. Our identities as Canadians and Americans are enriched by these differences, not threatened by them.
On our own, we make progress. But together, our two countries make history. Duty-bound, loyal, and forever linked, whatever the future holds, we will face it together: neighbors, partners, allies, and friends. This is our experience and our example to the world.
Barack, thank you for all that you have done these past 7 years to preserve this most important relationship. May the special connection between our two countries continue to flourish in the years to come, and may my gray hair come in at a much slower rate than yours has. [Laughter] And with that, on behalf of 36 million Americans, I propose a toast to the President, to the First Lady, and to the people of the United States of America. Cheers.
[Prime Minister Trudeau offered a toast.]
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"September 09, 1981","
The President. Ladies and gentlemen: Prime Minister Begin, it's a genuine pleasure to welcome you to the White House this evening—I should say, welcome you back, because the Prime Minister is no stranger to this room. As a matter of fact, I have a funny feeling that he may have dined here more often than I have. [Laughter]
Be that as it may, once again, he's an honored guest. But this time Nancy and I have the privilege, and we're delighted. I'm not sure whether you saw it or not, Mr. Prime Minister, but in the play ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" one of the townspeople asked the rabbi if he had a proper blessing for the czar. The rabbi answered, ""Why, of course. May God bless and keep the czar—far away from us."" [Laughter]
Prime Minister Begin, as you know, the Jewish people have never been far away from sorrow and depression during their long and troubled history. And now—I don't believe your own influence on Jewish history goes as far back as the time of the czars. Now, you understand that there wouldn't be anything wrong with that; you will hear no criticism of age tolerated in this house. [Laughter] Lately, I've been heartened to remember that Moses was 80 when God commissioned him for public service, and he lived to be 120. [Laughter] And Abraham was 100 and his wife, Sarah, 90, when they did something truly amazing. [Laughter] He survived to be 175. So, Mr. Prime Minister, we haven't even hit our full stride yet. [Laughter]
But to be serious a moment: After our conversations today, very warm and productive, I'm convinced that we're on the way to the right road, that we really can draw closer to that golden age of peace, prosperity, and brotherhood and reason. And I think this is clear: Providence has blessed us at this critical time with two leaders—one in Israel and one in Egypt-uniquely capable of the great decisions that are required.
Prime Minister Begin, I remember reading in your book, ""White Nights,"" how as a young man being held inside Soviet prisons, you longed to return with your people to the Middle East. And even then, you told your captors there would be plenty of room for the Arabs, for millions of Jews, and for peace. And you've been working ever since to make that dream come true. Though trained as a lawyer, you passed up the quiet life of a private attorney. From your earliest days, the spirit of freedom burned within you, leading you to make great personal sacrifices for the Jewish people.
As a political inmate in those Soviet dungeons, you learned the horrors of totalitarian abuse. You fought against Hitler, and you spent your early adult years helping create a haven for your people in a new Israel. Devoted to democratic traditions, you served as leader of your country's loyal opposition for nearly 30 years. Consistent in your views and skillful in presenting them, you were elected leader of a free people who recently reaffirmed their esteem for you. Called as a peacemaker, you boldly seized the opportunity for peace with Egypt and skillfully pursued it to a successful conclusion.
Mr. Prime Minister, the commitment you're making is a commitment to future generations. In the Talmud, there is a story about a man—and I should have asked you whether the pronunciation was ""Ho-nee"" or ""Ho-ni,"" but one of the two—and one day he was walking along and he saw an old man planting carob trees. It's said that the carob tree doesn't produce fruit for 70 years. And Honei commented to the old man, ""Certainly, you don't expect to see the fruit from this tree."" And the old man answered, ""I came into this world and people had planted trees for me. I am planting for those who will come after me.""
Well, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for planting these seeds of peace.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask all of you to join me in a toast to Prime Minister Begin and his friends and the Israeli people. And, if I may refer to that rabbi from ""Fiddler on the Roof' once again, ""May the good Lord bless and keep you always close to us.""
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, may I be allowed first of all to thank you for a good day. Our lives were harsh; the difficult days were many. The few ones, we remember them, we count them. You gave us today a good day, one of the few, through the warmth of your heart, your deep humanity, your friendship, understanding. And I believe all my friends and colleagues here assembled join me in the expression of that gratitude to you for a good day in our lives.
Both our nations, Mr. President, are built on vision. Vision is no utopia; it is the prerequisite for changing reality. Your Founding Fathers expressed their vision in the Declaration of Independence, mainly written by Jefferson, proclaiming self-evident truths. But if they are self-evident, why proclaim? But that proclamation called upon people to go into battle, poorly armed against professional soldiers, and after great suffering, win the day and create the greatest republic ever known in history.
Your Founding Fathers wrote a constitution—original, unknown in those days, and it works for more than 200 years. There are some crises from time to time, but out of every crisis democracy comes out stronger, deeper in the United States. And the Constitution works, with some amendments.
Then you had the vision of building real democracy. Perhaps this is the greatest achievement of the American people, proving in the 18th century, that it is not so that one man should inherit a throne and a crown and rule millions of people at his will. The people should decide who should form the government, and they should accept the government willingly. This, all nations learned from you. And perhaps the greatest vision of all was the acceptance of so many people of various origins from many countries. Here I would like to stress, because I believe in Divine Providence with all my heart, that as far as the Jewish people are concerned, a real miracle happened to them. In 25 years, at the turn of the two centuries, 2 1/2 million Jews crossed the ocean and came to the hospitable shores of this country. If they hadn't done that, they would have been lost—their children and their grandchildren. Not a third of the Jewish people would have been wiped out, perhaps two-thirds of them would have been destroyed. Who knows whether we would have been able to recreate our statehood.
This is one of the great miracles in human history—those 25 years, 100,000 people every year coming to these shores. There is no wonder that Emma Lazarus wrote from her heart, ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" They came here without knowing one word of English. They worked in sweatshops, and they were peddlers. But the second generation learned perfect English. And the third, together with all the other nationalities—or ethnic groups as you call them in America—built up this great country. A miracle, indeed. And I want now after so many years to express, may I say morally, historically, our deep gratitude that this great country made it possible for 2 1/2 million of my brethren to come here and save their lives and the lives of three other generations.
We also build on vision, Mr. President-on a smaller scale, of course, because we are a New Hampshire more or less, no more, a small country. But when we won our freedom in the same way you did, fighting for it, not getting it as a gift, we were only 600,000. Now we are 3 1/2 million. Relatively, proportionately perhaps, it is very close. And so that was the vision—to bring people from the four corners of the world as the prophet really foresaw in his vision in the ancient times, from the four corners of the world back to the land of the forefathers, back, return, old and young and limping and sick and everyone, so as the prophets wrote exactly. And of course we still keep the gates open for everyone who feels that he is persecuted, like in Russia, or humiliated, like in any other country which may happen, for everyone, as you did for so many years, actually for nearly two centuries.
We also had the vision of democracy. As we are a small country, ours is a parliamentary regime. I am not ashamed to say we copied it from the British. The British built up a beautiful home in their own country-real democracy. And we adopted this system, but it is also real democracy.
Mr. President, the election day in Israel-it was only 2 months ago—was one of the most beautiful days in our lives. Everybody a free citizen, went to the polls, put in the ballots. No pressure was asserted; it was impossible. The campaign was perhaps to some extent lively. [Laughter] But the day of the election, the quiet—it's the most beautiful day of the year. But of 4 years-real democracy.
And out of those ballots came a government. Not everybody is happy. Well, that is human nature. And therefore, believe it when we say we are your stable ally. We mean it completely, because only through the inherent stability of democracy you can keep that stability.
All the other regimes—something happens and there is upheaval. Not in a democracy. We still have division of peace, Mr. President. Yes, we made peace with Egypt, with our southern neighbor, the largest, the strongest Arab nation. But we want peace with all our neighbors.
Why isn't it so simple to achieve? Because for us, security is not a word, it's not even a concept. It is life itself. With our experience, surrounded on the northern, on the eastern front, still, after the peace, after the sacrifices we gave, we must be so careful. We bear so grave a responsibility, not only a great one in our generation in the wake of the Holocaust, to make sure that our children and our children's children will first of all live, and then live freely.
Security to us is so unique that we cannot only proclaim. Peace without security is hollow for us. Peace must be based on security. And we still bear in our hearts the prophets' vision of eternal peace, of complete disarmament, ""neither will they learn or teach war.""
It is difficult now to believe that it is realistic. All the world is arming to the teeth. Every disarmament conference brings more arms to the world. But our faith is unshakeable. This vision of the prophets will be realized, perhaps exactly as a result of that danger, which is looming over all mankind, of complete destruction. Out of that evil will come real peace and disarmament, and people will live together in good neighborhood—all of them.
We didn't have one day of peace. Nations fought. There was a war of 100 years between England and France. Ultimately, there was entente cordiale—a union or alliance-unwritten, that played so great a role in the years of 1914 and 1918. There was a 30-years war in Europe. In Europe, the saying went around about ""eternal enemies,"" and the eternal enemies are now friends. War can be avoided. Peace is inevitable. But we didn't deviate even one day of peace. What my colleagues and I would like to do for our people is to give them an historic period of peace—two or three generations at least. Let them have peace and let there be no bereavements. That is our vision, and I believe it will bring us nearer a different reality.
Mr. President, today we achieved much in Washington, thanks to you. I shall leave town knowing that our cooperation in the field of security and strategy—in the face of a world danger to lose all the values we believe in, which make life worthwhile to live—will be concrete and close. This is a real achievement, again, thanks to you, Mr. President, to your wisdom and the warmth of your heart.
Now, before I raise my glass, I would like to tell a story. I cannot but tell at least one story after hearing your speech, Mr. President. At least one story. But I must caution my respected listeners that detect a chauvinistic Israeli undertone. [Laughter] I don't like it, and I don't mean it, and I apologize in advance; but the story is interesting, so I will tell it.
It goes like this: The President brought me into the Oval Office, and he showed me on the table three phones—one white and one blue. And he explained to me: ""The white is the direct line to Mrs. Thatcher; the blue to President Mitterrand."" And then I asked him, ""What is the red phone?"" ""That is a direct line to God."" So, I asked the President, ""Mr. President, do you use it often?"" And the President said, ""Oh, no, very rarely. It's very expensive. Long distance-so long a distance. And I cannot afford it. I have to cut the budget and "" [Laughter]
So, then the President visited Jerusalem, and I showed him my office, and there are three phones. One was white, one was blue. And I said, ""The white is a direct line to President Sadat."" By the by, I have such a line, and he has such a line. ""And the other, well, to Mrs. Thatcher."" And there is a red phone. And the President asked, ""What is the red phone for?"" And I said, ""This is a direct line to God."" So, the President asked me, ""Do you use it often?"" I say, ""Every day."" ""How can you afford it?"" And I said, ""Here, in Jerusalem, it is being considered a local call."" [Laughter]
Now, Mr. President, neither of us has direct lines to God. I only believe that God listens to the prayer of a Jew and a Christian and of a Moslem—of every human being. But, if I have to continue with the story, then I will say that when you come, as I do believe, to Jerusalem, I will immediately put at your disposal the red phone. [Laughter] On the house. [Laughter] A local call.
I raise my glass to the President of the United States—a man of principle, a wonderful man whom we respect and love, the first day we met. [Referring to Mrs. Reagan:] Madam, the first sight. And to a great, devoted friend of the Jewish people and the State of Israel, and to the defender of freedom throughout the world.
To the President.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"July 25, 2015","
President Kenyatta. Thank you very much, Amina. And I appreciate your sentiments. President Barack Obama, President Mwai Kibaki, our distinguished visitors, distinguished guests: Let me begin once again, as I have said severally since the start of this visit, on behalf of the people of the Republic of Kenya, that we are once again delighted to welcome you to this country and to this city. And I know and strongly believe that you have felt the warmth of our people and, indeed, especially you, President Obama, the tremendous joy at your presence here with us in Nairobi and in Kenya. Welcome and welcome again.
Mr. President, this is not your first trip to Kenya. And indeed, we have heard severally, Amina has just mentioned, and you yourself have told us that you have been here. But yesterday you returned riding on the wings of history as a President of historic consequence for America, for Africa, and most importantly, for Kenya.
As a world leader who has grappled with great challenges of this age and as a builder of bridges, and to you once again, we say, karibu na sana Kenya.
The people of Kenya and the United States share such an abiding love of freedom that we have made grim sacrifices to secure it for our children. We then chose to weave our diverse cultures into a national tapestry of harmonious coexistence. Our paths have not been easy. We have not realized these values in full measure, as indeed we have discussed. But our record has been one of steady progress.
Indeed, Kenya has been inspired by the immense accomplishments of the United States in its 239 years of independence. We, as a country, are much younger. It has been a mere half century since the dawn of our republic. Yet, in that time, we've had the foundation built for an enduring democracy. On our journey, we have been strengthened by the support of our friends, and few of them have been closer than the United States.
In 1959, one of our own national heroes, Tom Mboya, shared a stage with Martin Luther King, Jr., and he said that Africans and the Americans of the civil rights movement were united in a common search for political freedom. He would then join hands with Senator John F. Kennedy, other American philanthropists and activists, to bring hundreds of young Kenyans to American universities. He hoped to prepare a group of educated and committed Kenyans who would complete the transition from colonial domination to self-government.
His hopes were more than fulfilled. The Nobel Laureate, the late environmentalist, Professor Wangari Maathai, was one of those who traveled. Another was Barack Obama Senior, your father, who had the same audacious hope that you have and spoke powerfully about it: to make something of his immense promise and to bring development and freedom to his people.
To this day, Kenyans still travel to the United States in search of education. Some of those assembled here went to American colleges, and Kenyans now form the second largest group of students from Africa in the United States. Indeed, Mr. President, you and I have constituents in common. [Laughter] The largest part of our diaspora, many holding dual citizenships, and who are now entitled to vote in Kenya as well—[laughter]—reside in America. America has shown great generosity in aiding our development efforts and has supported our democratic aspirations. Our relationship has been unbroken for half a century. And, Mr. President, I believe that you and I can deepen this relationship. And together, we can make this region safe again. We can secure democracy, and we can bring our entrepreneurs and investors together for our common prosperity.
I, indeed, look forward to continuing our conversation in the coming weeks and months. And indeed, before I conclude, I must say that this is destiny in many ways. Fifty-some years ago, I don't think anybody would ever have realized what we share here today. As those who left Kenyan shores, aided and supported by the American brothers and sisters who shared the very ideals that this country then was fighting for and who welcomed our own men and women at the time, I don't think many ever realized that one day a product of that initiative to support our freedom struggle would one day return and be an engine to propel and to transform the African Continent.
This shows the deep partnership that exists between our two countries. This shows that the values we state today, that we share, are not new. These are values that both our nations hold dear. And the truth is, these are values that many of us in our country, Kenya, have chosen to forget. Indeed, it is my wish that today, as we welcome the President of the United States, whose father one day left our shores, and who today returns as President of one of the greatest nations in this world, that we too may learn that greatness is also amongst us if we could just come together, forget our narrow differences, and look towards the future with hope and build on the potential, especially of our young people.
And as I was telling the President earlier, and it still remains my strong belief, as many have said, you know, President Obama has not done enough for Africa—I tend to disagree with that statement. Because ""enough"" is not about how much money you put on the table. That's not the issue. Africa no longer wants to hold out its hand, begging bowl in place, how much are you going to put.
What President Barack Obama has given back to us is a belief and a hope that, empowered, we can do and achieve for ourselves. He has given us the tools and the belief that it is possible, through our own initiative and hard work, that we can take control of our own destiny, and that we can lead change not just on our continent, but in the world.
I don't think there could be a bigger gift. And indeed, as I say that we shall sadly see you depart tomorrow, we wish you safe travels. We look forward to having you back at some stage in the near future. [Laughter] And please, on behalf of the people of this republic, may you convey our warmest regards to your wife, Michelle, to Malia and Sasha, and to say that Kenyans are also looking forward to welcoming them to our shores sometime in the very near future.
And with those very few and brief remarks—[laughter]—indeed, it is now my pleasure and my honor to ask you all to be up standing and to raise a toast to the President of the United States of America, to the friendship and partnership between our two countries and peoples, now and always.
To the President.
[At this point, President Kenyatta offered a toast.]
President Obama. Thank you so much. Habari ya jioni. [Laughter] President Kenyatta, the lovely Madame First Lady, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I want to once again
just express my deepest gratitude to you and the Kenyan people for the incredible hospitality you have shown to me and my delegation, including the Members of Congress who are here today and are doing outstanding work. In my visits here as a younger man, I could have never imagined the outpouring of friendship that I feel today. And so I feel, like my given African name, to be truly blessed.
The presence of the Members of Congress who are here today, I think it describes and expresses the deep support for a strong partnership with Africa and with Kenya. We were able to get the AGOA bill passed. And those of you who know American politics, there aren't too many things where Republicans and Democrats agree these days. [Laughter] But expanding trade and investment and deepening our relationship with Africa is something that garnered bipartisan support. And it's an indication of how the American people feel.
It's a—part of what makes this a special evening for me is the presence of my family members who are here. My grandmother, Mama Sarah, who told me I had to come back to Kenya. And when she says you should do something, generally, you have to do it. [Laughter] I've told this story before—the first time that I visited Kogelo, we—Auma and I and my brothers were there. She—Mama Sarah speaks Swahili and Luo, and I speak neither—[laughter]—and so Auma was serving as a translator. And I think about a half a day had passed before suddenly, she turns to Auma and says something. And Auma starts laughing, and I say, what did she say? She says, he goes to Harvard; if he's so smart, how come he can't talk to his grandmother? [Laughter] Which was a good point.
My siblings are here, aunts, uncles. And so tonight I welcome all of them to a somewhat unusual Obama family reunion. I suspect that some of my critics back home are suggesting that I'm back here to look for my birth certificate. [Laughter] That is not the case. [Laughter]
But what is true is, is that obviously there are emotions to a visit like this. Memories come rushing back. When I was in college, and my father was here, I wrote him a letter telling him of my hope to visit. And he wrote me back, and he said, ""Dear Son, even if it is only for a few days, the important thing is that you know your people."" Now, he died in an accident before I was able to make that trip. But in fact, when I came, I did get to know them, the people of Kenya. And although, once again, I'm here only for a few days, I remain grateful for that relationship.
I've seen the resolve and the determination to pull together, under a new Constitution, as one people. I've seen your dynamism, as you've built the largest economy in East Africa. And I've seen the resilience, as in the recent reopening of the Westgate Mall, which shows that the spirit of the Kenyan people cannot be broken.
And I've seen it in the friendship between our peoples, particularly our young people. As many of you know, our Mandela Fellows program invites promising African youth to the United States so they can develop skills and training, and forge relationships as future leaders here in Africa. And we learn from them, as well. And it's one of the most important ways that we invest in Africa's future. It's something I'm very passionate about personally.
In fact, at this very moment, as part of this program, there are 40 young Kenyans across the United States living and working and learning, but also sharing Kenyan culture with their American hosts. Americans are learning Swahili. They're eating chapatti—[laughter]—and they're listening to Kenyan music. In California, they've been dancing to ""Sura Yako.""
So here tonight, and across the United States, Kenyans and Americans are coming together. We're understanding each other better. We're finding new ways to partner. And I believe that if we can build on what we've accomplished on this visit, then we can achieve even more in the years to come: for our people, for our beautiful lands, for our freedom, for peace.
I was reflecting on what President Kenyatta said about the past and history. And our fathers were people who lived at the same time and went through independence of this country at the same time, took different paths obviously—my father was significantly younger—and it's true that it would have been hard for them to imagine how their sons might be sitting here today. [Laughter]
But there's an expression that says we plant a tree not because we will enjoy its shade, but because our children and grandchildren will.
And so I'd like to propose a toast not only to this generation of Kenyans and Africans, not only to future generations of Kenyans and Africans and Americans, but also to our forefathers and our foremothers who laid the groundwork, who planted the seed so that we could enjoy a little bit of shade.
To the people of Kenya and to the people of the United States of America, munga abariki Kenya.
[President Obama offered a toast.]

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"November 24, 2009","
President Obama. Please be seated. Good evening, everyone. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. Aapka swagat hai.
Many of you were here when I was honored to become the first President to help celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights. Some of you were here for the first White House celebration of the birth of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak. Tonight we gather again for the first state dinner of my Presidency, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Mrs. Gursharan Kaur, as we celebrate the great and growing partnership between the United States and India.
As we all know, in India, some of life's most treasured moments are often celebrated under the cover of a beautiful tent. It's a little like tonight. We have incredible food and music and are surrounded by great friends. For it's been said that ""the most beautiful things in the universe are the starry heavens above us and the feeling of duty within us.""
Mr. Prime Minister, today we work to fulfill our duty—bring our countries closer together than ever before. Tonight, under the stars, we celebrate the spirit that will sustain our partnership, the bonds of friendship between our people.
It's a bond that includes more than 2 million Indian Americans who enrich every corner of our great Nation—leaders in government, science, industry, and the arts—some of whom join us tonight. And it's the bond of friendship between a President and a Prime Minister who are bound by the same unshakable spirit of possibility and brotherhood that transformed both our nations, a spirit that gave rise to movements led by giants like Gandhi and King and which are the reason that both of us can stand here tonight.
And so, as we draw upon these ties that bind our common future together, I want to close with the words that your first Prime Minister spoke at that midnight hour on the eve of Indian independence, because Nehru's words speak to our hopes tonight: ""The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the great triumphs and achievements that await us. . . .The past is over, and it is the future that beckons us now.""
So I propose a toast to all of you.
Does the Prime Minister get a glass? Thank you. Just logistically, we want to make sure the Prime Minister has a glass here. [Laughter]
To the future that beckons all of us, let us answer its call. And let our two great nations realize all the triumphs and achievements that await us. Cheers.
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
Prime Minister Singh. Mr. President; the First Lady, Mrs. Michelle Obama; distinguished guests: I feel privileged to be invited to this first state banquet, Mr. President, under your distinguished Presidency. You do us and the people of India great honor by this wonderful gesture on your part. We are overwhelmed by the warmth of your hospitality, the courtesy you have extended to us personally, and the grace and charm of the First Lady.
Mr. President, your journey to the White House has captured the imagination of millions and millions of people in India. You are an inspiration to all those who cherish the values of democracy, diversity, and equal opportunity.
Mr. President, I can do no better than to describe your achievements in the words of Abraham Lincoln, who said, and I quote, ""In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It is the life in your years,"" unquote.
Mr. President, we warmly applaud the recognition by the Nobel Committee of the healing touch you have provided and the power of your idealism and your vision.
Mr. President, your leadership of this great nation of the United States coincides with a time of profound changes taking place in the world at large. We need to find new pathways of international cooperation that respond more effectively to the grave challenges caused by the growing interdependence of nations. As two leading democracies, India and the United States must play a leading role in building a shared destiny for all humankind.
Mr. President, a strong and sustained engagement between our two countries is good for our people, and equally, it is highly important for the world as a whole. We are embarking on a new phase of our partnership. We should build on our common values and interests to realize the enormous potential and promise of our partnership.
Our expanding cooperation in areas of social and human development, science and technology, energy, and other related areas will improve the quality of lives of millions of people in our country. The success of the nearly 2.7 million strong American community is a tribute to our common ethos. They have enriched and deepened our ties, and I thank them profoundly from the core of my heart.
Mr. President, I convey my very best wishes to you. Mr. President, as you lead this great Nation, I look forward to working with you to renew and expand our strategic partnership. I wish you and the people of America a very, very happy Thanksgiving.
Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to join me in a toast to the health and happiness of President Barack Obama and the First Lady, Mrs. Obama, the friendly people of the United States of America, and stronger and stronger friendship between India and the United States of America.
President Obama. Cheers.
[A toast was offered.]
President Obama. Thank you, everybody. Enjoy your evening.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"June 25, 1979","
Your Majesty, you do my country and the American people great honor by receiving me, my wife, and my party to this beautiful room. There is a strong sense of history here: the history of your ancestors as Emperors of Japan stretching back to the very beginning of the nation; the history of Japan's development as a nation with great world influence, that began with the reign of your grandfather; and, the history of relations between Japan and the United States, reaching back to the visit of Commodore Perry in 1853.
We are proud to be part of this great flow of history, to build on the exchange of visits begun in 1974 by President Ford and continued during Your Majesty's memorable trip to the United States in 1975.
The American people still remember fondly the warmth and the friendship of your visit with us. The past century and a quarter has seen the relationship between our two countries and between the peoples grow to be as busy and as close as between any two nations on Earth. Together we have developed a combination of unmatched productivity and economic strength and a strong, shared devotion to the ideals of freedom, democracy, and the betterment of mankind.
Our relationship has seen times of great trouble and tragedy. But the close partnership we have forged in the last generation, in the Pacific region and around the world, amply justifies the common vision of the Japanese and Americans who saw in the 19th century that the future of our two nations would inevitably be 'linked.
Our achievements together over the years—in trade, in education, in science, in culture, in sports, in the cause of peace and friendship among nations—are a triumph of determination and hard work.
Your grandfather expressed that spirit eloquently in one of his poems. He said: ""Even up a mountain peak which seems to reach the skies, we dare to say for him whose will is set on climbing it, there is a way.""
We have much to learn from you. You've succeeded in preserving the best of your own traditions while harnessing the opportunities offered by change. You've maintained a sense of community bonds, the closeness of families, a special grace and civility and gentleness in your relations with each other despite the noise and the pressures of an industrial society. You've preserved the special Japanese ability to create and discover delicate beauty and harmony in every aspect of life, from the simplest, most natural things, to great architectural structures.
At the same time, you've grown to be an economic super power. You've harnessed the ingenuity and the creativity and energy of your people to gain the fruits of industry, technology, productivity, vigorous trade, prosperity, and growth.
Most important to Americans, you've achieved all of this in one of the most open, democratic, free societies on Earth. You've found a harmony between the dignity and worth of each individual human being and the responsibilities of shared effort and common purposes that a democracy demands.
We live in a world of rapid, sometimes bewildering change. People in many nations are struggling to preserve the values of their cultures and their traditions while they meet the complex challenges of development and growth. Japan offers a model of hope from which all nations can learn.
Your Majesty, I understand that at the beginning of each year you plant a tiny rice seedling as a symbol of your hope that your people will enjoy a bountiful future. I am a farmer. I know about the hard work, the attention, the care that successful crops require. I share your faith that working together, both our peoples can enjoy a more hopeful, more prosperous future, and that together with our allies and our friends who meet with us this week, we can do much to spread the blessings of prosperity and peace to disadvantaged peoples around the world.
During the next few days, leaders of great nations will represent the. industrial democracies at the economic summit. It would be easy to focus only on the magnitude of the challenges we face in energy, in our own economies, in helping to meet the needs of the developing nations, in working together to build a more secure and a peaceful world. But I also think about the tremendous resources of our seven nations; the resources of our economies, the strongest, most vital, most dynamic in the world; the resources of our farmland and agricultural systems, the most productive on this Earth; our achievements in technology and science, in which we are unequaled; and the resources of our centers of learning and education and research, which attract students from almost every land. Most of all, I think of the resources of the spirit of the more than one-half billion free people in the major industrial democracies. I think of the strength of the ideals of freedom and individual dignity that our nations embody, ideals that still exert an almost magnetic attraction to disadvantaged people all over the Earth.
I have no doubt that together we have the resources, the skill, and the dedication to assure that people everywhere can be adequately fed; that our factories and farms and homes can draw on abundant, secure sources of energy; that the prosperity so many of us have enjoyed can be shared by others for whom life is little more than the struggle to survive from day to day. I'm confident that together we can build a world in which all peoples can live in peace.
Drawing upon the strength and the flow of history uniting our two nations, we shall together reach the goal that Your Majesty set in a poem you wrote for the new year nearly 40 years ago, and you said then:
""We pray for the time to comeWhen East, West and allMaking friends with one anotherWill share in a prosperous future.""
Your Majesty, with this goal in mind, I offer a toast to the health and wellbeing of Your Imperial Majesty, your family, the great people of Japan, and the harmony and friendship which binds us all together.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"May 06, 1998","
Good evening, and welcome to the White House, Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Prodi, distinguished members of the Italian delegation, my fellow Americans.
Mr. Prime Minister, today we accomplished a great deal. Tonight we celebrate the ties that bind us.
Those ties begin with the discoveries of Columbus and Vespucci, whose busts adorn the Blue Room next door. When the Founders created the American Republic, they looked to Rome for inspiration. George Washington was likened to Cincinnatus, the Roman hero who abandoned his plow to rescue his country by popular demand. I might say, they were the last two people to head our countries only by popular demand. [Laughter]
Poets and philosophers of the Roman Republic were read and rejuvenated as our new Republic looked to the past to plan our future. In the writings of ancient Roman thinkers like Cicero and Cato, America's Founders saw the promise of democratic representative government. Every aspect of our new Republic paid tribute to the simple grandeur of Rome: from our architecture to words like ""senate"" and ""capitol."" Indeed, after our Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked what our Founders had produced. His simple reply was, ""A Republic, sir, if you can keep it.""
Towns sprang up with the names from the ancient Mediterranean world, names like Utica, Troy, or the Vice President's hometown, Carthage. Artists portrayed America's leaders wearing togas, as the bust of George Washington in the hall demonstrates. Thankfully, that is a tradition we have left to the 19th century. [Laughter]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, our Republic turned into a bustling nation, thanks in no small measure to Italian-Americans. Ancient Rome was replaced by young Italy in the American imagination. And democracy was given new life by heroes like Mazzini and Garibaldi.
America's growing cities attracted millions of Italians, eager to build a new life in a new world. They worked hard. They prospered. Today American Italians, or Italian-Americans, are leaders in every enterprise conducted in our Nation. And as we all know, it is impossible to walk more than a few blocks in any American city without hearing the words ""caffe latte."" [Laughter]
The people here in this room tonight are the link between our two countries, between two cultures that have nourished each other since America was just an idea. From our highest courts to our finest tables, from our playing fields to our silver screen, from one side of the aisle in Congress to the other, Italian-Americans have graced our Nation with their intellect, their industry, their good will, and above all, a contagious love of life.
Mr. Prime Minister, you have accomplished so much in your time in office. You have presided over a string of economic successes. And Americans especially admire your perseverance in leading Italy toward European monetary union. Without Italy, Europe is not Europe. And without Europe, the world would be a poorer, less free, and much duller place.
Italy has been a force for peace and security in its region, on the Continent, around the world, in Albania, in Bosnia, and in Kosovo, where we're working hard together to bring about a peaceful resolution. America is proud to know you as a partner and an ally, and we are grateful for your provision of our military bases, sent to help maintain Europe's hard-won peace.
Mr. Prime Minister, we take pride in our strong friendship. We know it will continue to grow stronger as we enter the new millennium, a word that brings us, once again, back to Rome. For just as the Pax Romana spread far and wide through the ancient world, we hope and work for the peace of a new millennium that will allow more people than ever before to live their dreams in security.
If we can achieve a peace of the millennium, then the ancient dream of Columbus to explore new places can be lived by more people than ever—new places in outer space, in biotechnology and medical research, in the hearts and minds of people around the world who still look to Italy and America for confirmation that a good society can be created from many parts.
E pluribus unum, the motto of the United States, a principle cherished by Italians and Americans: Out of many, one. Mr. Prime Minister, let us make it so.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me in a toast to the Prime Minister and Mrs. Prodi and the people of Italy.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"November 13, 1984","
The President. Your Royal Highnesses, Excellencies, and ladies and gentlemen:
Yesterday the people of Luxembourg marked a great day in the life of their nation, the 20th anniversary of the ascension to the throne of His Royal Highness Grand Duke Jean. Your Highness, on behalf of all Americans, permit me to give you and your people our heartfelt congratulations.
It's a deep honor to welcome you to the White House as you begin your visit to our country. Permit me to add that when you reach California, Nancy and I would like you to give that great State our love. [Laughter] You see, as the result of a certain political exercise that concluded a week ago, it looks as though we won't be living back there for—oh, maybe not till 1989. [Laughter]
Luxembourg possesses a thousand years and more of national history. It's a beautiful and a varied land, ranging from the forests and hills of the north to the fertile plains of the south. It's a prosperous country with a mighty steel industry and dozens of new industries and services gathering strength. And it's a nation of self-confidence and charm, with a gracious way of life based on an abiding love of family and freedom. Luxembourg is a proud and alluring country.
Yet Luxembourg acquires still greater strength and vitality as an active member of the family of nations. It was a founder of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community. In your free and fair world trade, Luxembourg has set an example for all nations to follow and shown the world that prosperity Comes not with less but with more international trade.
Individual Luxembourgers have rendered outstanding diplomatic services. Robert Schuman, one of the leading advocates of a united Europe, was a native of your country. Joseph Bech was instrumental in bringing the European coal and steel community to Luxembourg in 1951. And men like Gaston Thorn and Pierre Werner have played memorable roles in world diplomacy.
Over the years, relations between Luxembourg and the United States have been those of close and abiding friends. We view with the deepest respect your contributions to NATO, including the registration of AWAC's aircraft and your splendid efforts during the Enforcer exercises. And we look forward to consulting closely with your government when Luxembourg assumes the Presidency of the Council of the European Community during the latter half of next year.
Your Highness, we in the United States are convinced that the Western world faces a future of strength and prosperity. In recent years, the Western allies have stood together against the bluff and bluster of our adversaries and become more firmly united than ever. And although all of us have passed through difficult periods of economic adjustment, many of our basic industries are becoming more efficient, and breakthroughs in high technology and other new fields are leading our nations into a time of sustained growth. For Luxembourg, America, and so many other free nations, today our future promises not stagnation and decline, but opportunity and hope.
And tonight, as we look to the future, it's fitting to remain mindful of our past. Forty years ago, Your Highness, Americans and Luxembourgers fought side by side to liberate your nation. Throughout America today, there are thousands of men who can still recall the tear-streaked faces of your people when they realized that at long last they were free.
To me, the most memorable story is about a strapping young American named George Mergenthaler. For several weeks, George was stationed in the village of Eschweiler, in World War II. He had a winning personality, and before long, the good people of Eschweiler took him into their homes and hearts. They told him what life in the village had been like before the war and then during the Nazi occupation. And George, in turn, opened his heart. He told the people that he was an only son, told them all his hopes for when the war was over. And in those few weeks, a deep bond formed between the people of that ancient village and the amiable young Yankee.
Some time afterward, the people of Eschweiler learned that George had taken part in a fierce battle on the plains between Luxembourg and Belgium. It was called the Battle of the Bulge. And it cost George his life.
Today, 40 years later, there is still a plaque honoring George Mergenthaler in the Eschweiler village church. It reads simply: ""This only son died that others' sons might live in love and peace.""
Well, Your Highness, today our sons and daughters know that peace. And the bond between our nations is truly a bond of love.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you would please join me in a toast to their Royal Highnesses, the Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg, our friends.
The Grand Duke. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, the Grand Duchess and I would like to express our sincere gratitude for your invitation, your gracious hospitality, and your kind words regarding our country. May we express our great pleasure at this opportunity as the first head of state to congratulate you personally on the overwhelming result of your reelection to a second term as President of the United States. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, we had never any doubt about the outcome. [Laughter]
We are confident that this great nation, under your able leadership, will continue to give the necessary guidance to all the countries of the free world and encourage democracies in their endeavor to promote freedom.
There are no problems which separate the United States and Luxembourg. How could it be otherwise, when America, on two occasions, played a paramount role in the liberation of my country?
In 1918, as well as in 1944, young Americans gave their lives in order to free the Grand Duchy from foreign oppression. These sacrifices I recall at a particularly appropriate time: This year, 1984, marks the 40th anniversary of the liberation of occupied Europe, including Luxembourg, and the final victory of the Battle of the Ardennes.
The people of Luxembourg will never forget the generous help of their American friends, which twice preserved our freedom and our independence. Corresponding to our national motto, we wish to remain what we are. This is the reason why, after leaving Washington, I will visit Colorado Springs in order to pay tribute to the American Army and Air Force.
Mr. President, we all know relations between our two countries are excellent. I am convinced that we could improve them even more. As mutual understanding, upon which friendship is based, exists between us, there should be no difficulty to proceed successfully in this way.
Back home, my countrymen follow with interest and pride this visit of their head of state. They know it is a token of sympathy of a great nation to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.
I beg you to accept, Mr. President, along with all my thanks, my countrymen's best wishes of happiness and prosperity for your nation and yourself.
May I add a special thanks to you, Mr. President, for having mentioned my 20th anniversary which took place yesterday on the 12th of November when I took over from my dear mother. It was really awfully kind of you to mention it this evening. Thank you again.
May I ask you now to rise for a toast to the President of the United States of America, to the well-being and the prosperity of the American people, and to the friendship between Luxembourg and the United States.
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"November 12, 1983","
Mr. President, Nancy and I both want to thank you and Madame Chun for your gracious hospitality and your warm words of welcome to us. We're delighted and honored to return here to visit your dynamic country.
Much has been written concerning the Korean economic miracle of the past decades. The startling industry and progress of the Korean people are gaining increasing international recognition and respect. Only recently the Interparliamentary Union met in Seoul, and a new series of international events will culminate here in the 1988 Summer Olympics. This will be a proud moment for Korea. You and the Korean people have every right to feel joy in your hearts.
Mr. President, as Korea grows in international stature, you will hear increasing calls for assistance from allies and friends, calls to defend and promote the values—political, economic, and humanitarian—that both our peoples seek to live by.
Our mutual belief in economic freedom, for example, Mr. President, must not only be defended but spread as far as possible throughout the world. The 66 years that have followed the Russian Revolution and its attempt to turn Communist theory into practice have been marked by tragic failure. Innumerable variations of the Marxist economic system have brought stagnation, waste, and hardship to many countries and many peoples. We must never tire of reminding the world of this. We must never tire of explaining and promoting the free market system and its benefits.
And so, too, Mr. President, we must resist internal threats to our economic freedom, the calls to choke off international trade, to somehow protect jobs by denying our consumers the benefits of freedom of choice. The $12 billion in trade between our two countries has provided innumerable jobs to both our nations, and we must redouble our efforts to expand rather than constrict that trade.
Our political values also face unremitting challenges. Democracy and :.freedom of opinion are virtues the free"" world must cherish and defend. They distinguish us from totalitarian states. They are the source of our strength as nations, the very reason for our existence.
And finally, the' most basic human values—our concern for the rights of the individual, our belief in the sacredness of human life—there also, these go to the heart of our existence. The murder of 269 innocent people in a defenseless airliner, the very absence here tonight of some of your nation's finest public servants—these events have written in blood the stark contrast between those nations that respect human life and those that trample it. The vicious attack in Rangoon dramatizes the threat your people face. We must stand together to confront this dangerous challenge and to preserve the peace. And this we will do.
The increasing strength of the United States, our allies, and the progress of nations like Korea—as contrasted with the continuing failure and moral decline of the Communist nations—only serve to strengthen my conviction: The tide of history is a freedom tide, and communism cannot and will not hold it back.
Our first hundred years of friendship are history; we are now beginning to write the history of our second hundred years. May the new era of Korean-American partnership be even more fruitful than the last. And may it bring to both our peoples a stronger prosperity, a renewed friendship and confidence, and the genuine peace and security which we so fervently seek.
Will you all join me in a toast to the Korean people, our staunch allies and good friends, and to the President of the Republic of Korea and Madame Chun.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"January 14, 1986","
President Reagan. President Febres-Cordero, Mrs. Cordero, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, it's an honor tonight to welcome to the White House a national leader who is clearly devoted to the political and economic freedom of his people.
President Febres-Cordero, when you were elected, you were well known to the Ecuadorian people as a man who would not waver in pursuit of the welfare of his country, even in the face of enormous pressure. You promised leadership and reform, and you have not let your people down. When we met, I could see in you the strength of character and love of liberty which the Ecuadorian voters saw. It's been a genuine pleasure for me to get to know you better after our first meeting a year and a half ago.
Here in this historic setting, which was once the home of Thomas Jefferson, it's fitting to recall, President Febres-Cordero, the words of your last State of the Nation message to the Ecuadorian people. In it you said, ""Democracy is the highest and most noble political system that mankind has created throughout its history."" Well, Jefferson would be proud of an expression such as that. Today we see a resurgence of democracy throughout the hemisphere, a resurgence which started, as did the cause of national independence, during the last century in Ecuador.
Democracy, as you have so eloquently stated on many occasions, Mr. President, is the way not only to freedom but also to peace and to economic progress. In Central America, we both know this is especially true. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your strong support of democracy in that troubled region. Those who would repress their own people and export subversion to their neighbors should not underestimate the depth of our commitment and steadfastness. They should note your words. You said, ""So long as the people are not given the full right to self-determination, there will not be peace in Central America."" Well, those of us who enjoy freedom cannot take it for granted. We cannot turn our backs on those struggling for freedom against oppressive regimes. We must provide assistance.
And, Mr. President, in that same State of the Nation Address, you reminded your people that Quito was once termed the ""light of the Americas."" And you challenged, ""All Ecuadorians must see to it that that light remain lit here and throughout the continent."" Well, in this task, holding high the light of liberty and freedom, the people of our two countries can and should and will stand together. So, let us drink a toast to that and to you, President and Mrs. Febres-Cordero.
President Febres-Cordero. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, distinguished guests, as President Reagan mentioned in his very kind words of offering, the talks that he and I have had have been what talks between old friends are like. The President's affability and unpretentiousness, as well as the coincidences on many of our points of view over the destinies of our countries and of the whole hemisphere, have allowed us to leave formalities aside and enable us to have clear and frank exchange of views.
When in my youth I studied in this great country, I could not have imagined then that a moment like this could ever take place. At that time, I frequently watched Western movies— [laughter] —some of them featuring an extremely likable star— [laughter] —called Ronald Reagan. [Laughter] I must confess that I'm still an addict to Westerns. [Laughter] But now I view President Reagan as the actor of a more transcendental and historical role. Of course, Mr. President, this doesn't mean at all that there is a significant distance between our respective ages. We belong to the same generation, a generation that, fortunately, always believed in the everlasting values of dignity; a generation that was and is willing to face up to obstacles and to overcome the rigors imposed by nature and by men.
You and I, Mr. President, have in us something like a cowboy spirit, and with that spirit we are trying to improve the lot of our countrymen. Our peoples and all mankind, Mr. President, are going through a period of strains and unprecedented problems. You, as I in my own country, are responsible for taking the reins of the state with the conviction that in so doing we are effectively serving our peoples. But we cannot complain; we have asked for it. [Laughter] We have no one to whom to complain for the burdens that our duties impose upon us. You are performing your task with courage, with vigor, and keen sight that will be recorded, definitely, by history. I hope, too, that my efforts will likewise be fruitful and that Ecuadorians may soon be able to lead a better life and that my country, Ecuador, may reaffirm some of those transcendental values that have been lately threatened.
Let me, in thanking you for your toast, express my best wishes for your permanent well-being and that of your distinguished wife and ratify, at the same time, my confidence in your nation's leadership within the important affairs of the world. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me now to raise the glass for the health and well-being of the President, Mrs. Reagan, and all her distinguished family.

Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, distinguished guests. First, on behalf of the American delegation, let me thank you for your warm hospitality, and indeed, I thank all of you for making us feel so welcome.
As you pointed out, Mr. President, it was 5 years ago next week when my wife and daughter first came to New Delhi. I confess I was a little jealous of them then because I wanted to come. And I am delighted finally to be here today.
One of my country's most beloved writers, Mark Twain, once wrote that India, and I quote, ""is the sole country under the Sun that all desire to see, and having seen once, would not trade that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the globe combined.""
India has given profound gifts to the world for thousands of years now. Nearly half of humanity practices the four great religions that were born here, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism. The whole world has been influenced by Indian culture.
Indian thinkers have enriched every science known to humanity. And I welcome the presence of so many of your scientists here tonight. However, I must confess there are many American high school students who wish that ""Aryabhatiya"" had kept his work on trigonometry to himself. [Laughter] The computer age would hardly be possible at all without the decimal system invented in India. And appropriately enough, 30 percent of the world's software engineers today are Indian.
Every American who has been moved by the universal philosophy of nonviolence, every American whose life was transformed by the civil rights movement, owes a debt to India. Today I had the great honor of visiting the Gandhi Memorial. Two weeks ago, in my own country, I visited Selma, Alabama, which is one of the sacred sites of our civil rights movement, where the words of Martin Luther King and the marches of ordinary citizens both echoed the ideas of Gandhi.
My country has been enriched by the contributions of more than a million Indian-Americans, from Vinod Dahm, the father of the Pentium chip, to Deepak Chopra, pioneer of alternative medicine, to Sabeer Bhatia, creator of the free-mail system Hotmail, the free E-mail system.
Now, next Sunday when the Academy Awards are given out in Los Angeles, more than a few people, not only in India but in America, will be rooting for director M. Night Shyamalan and his remarkable movie ""The Sixth Sense,"" nominated for best picture.
So we have gotten a lot from India, and we have neglected our friendship for too long. Today we are proud to be your partners, your allies, your friends in freedom.
As a President who has the good fortune to have been selected by an electorate that casts about 100 million votes, I can hardly imagine a nation with over 600 million eligible voters. I don't know how you please them all. Or should I say, 60 crore.
I didn't know what a crore was until I got here this time. Now I can go home and suggest to my Vice President that he have a new slogan: Four crore for Al Gore! [Laughter]
We have a lot to give the world in the richness of democracy. One of the great things about a democracy is, it is a system which allows us to resolve our differences through conversation, not confrontation. I've enjoyed the conversation that we began here today. I am grateful that we found common ground. I am convinced we have laid the foundation for a new respectful partnership based on our oldest and most enduring values.
In the days to come, may our two nations always remain examples of tolerance and the power of diversity. May we build societies that draw upon the talents and energies of all our people. May we preserve the beauty and natural richness of this small planet that we share. May we work together to make the difficult choices and the necessary investments, as Nehru once instructed, ""to advance the larger cause of humanity."" In the spirit of that partnership and that vision, I ask you all to join me in raising a glass to the President, the Prime Minister, and the people of this wonderful nation which has welcomed us.

President Macri. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here on this very special day.
[At this point, President Macri spoke in English as follows.]
President Macri. Welcome to Argentina. We thank you, your family, First Lady, your team for visiting us. And let me tell you that I want to insist that we appreciate the moment of this visit. We recognize this as a gesture of affection and friendship. And let me tell you, Michelle, that I named my wife the sorceress, but after watching you today, I think that we have the visit of another one in Argentina. [Laughter] Everybody has been fascinated by you.
And let me tell you that everybody is very excited and happy of receiving you in Bariloche. But there is a little problem that I am trying to fix because they are a little bit disappointed because you are not staying a few days more. But already, I have solved it, so I forgive you, because I have promised that next year, you are going to come with more time and stay several days in Bariloche.
Dear President, as you may know, the first republic that recognized the freedom of Argentina was your country.
[President Macri spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Macri. And our country grew with the same views and values as yours. And this room is called ""the room of emblems,"" and each column has an emblem representing a Province, equivalent to each of your States. And your commitment is to have Argentina be—our commitment is to have Argentina be a federal country. We are accompanied by many governors today, with the purpose of providing equal opportunities to all Argentinians, wherever they were born.
Your visit, Mr. President, comes at the perfect time. It's been perfect timing. It's a time when Argentinians have understood and decided that we want to build mature, sensible relationships with all countries, worldwide, based on three essential commitments: dialogue, mutual benefits, and shared responsibilities.
And when I talk about shared responsibilities, I'd like to mention your words at the Summit of the Americas in Panama, when you talked about the opportunities that our continent has ahead of it that forces us to lead aside all hatred and look into the future. Clearly, the American continent has nowadays—or is nowadays in a situation of privilege. It can be the continent providing the best opportunities to its peoples and allowing them to live in peace. But for that, we have to work together. When I talk about shared benefits, mutual benefits, I refer firstly to having the continent be a continent without poverty, and that requires better education and good-quality jobs.
Moreover, it calls for us to fight together against drug trafficking and terrorism, because that is what will make our people live at ease. And finally, we have to improve and allot the quality of our democracy, advocacy of human rights, and our quest for transparency. Based on these three pillars, I think we have a lot to build. Pope Francis, our Pope that was before here in Buenos Aires, quoted Thomas Merton in Congress. He talked about dialogue and mutual understanding, and everything is in its place so that between sovereign peers, dialoguing with respect, we can build solutions for our people to live better day after day. And that doesn't mean automatic alignments or ungrounded confrontations; don't expect that from us. With us, you'll find dialogue, good faith, and the belief that all that we are going to build is based on trust. In that, we have to invest and be consistent, day after day.
Argentina, just like the U.S.A., dear President, is a country of dreamers and entrepreneurs that came this far and has a lot more to do. So we fully trust our strength, our creativity, our capacity, and we look into the future with great optimism.
So that's why I believe that your visit, this startup of clever and mature relationships, has a lot to give the Argentine and the U.S. peoples. So I wish to thank you once again for your visit, and I remind you that we expect you, your family, and all U.S. families to visit us and share with us. I invite you to toast for the welfare of our peoples and for our mutual peace. Thank you.
[A toast was offered.]
President Obama. Muy buenas noches. Good evening, everybody. President Macri, Mrs. Macri, Michelle and I offer our deepest gratitude for your extraordinary and warm welcome, and we bring with us the warm greetings of the American people in return.
And let me say at the outset, I will not make a liar out of you, and we will make sure to come back—[laughter]—because this country is extraordinary and its people are wonderful.
In 1961, the year I was born, two of our predecessors, President John F. Kennedy and President Arturo Frondizi, sat down for a meeting in Florida. One of the agenda items was what to do about Cuba: what actions, if any, to take against their Government, or exclude them from our hemisphere.
I don't remember this meeting; I was only 4 months old. [Laughter] President Macri was just a toddler. But I mention this because almost 55 years and a lot of history later, we meet in Buenos Aires at a new and very different era in our hemisphere. I've just come from Cuba, where the United States growing engagement there is aimed at improving the lives of the Cuban people. And I'm here in Buenos Aires because, Mr. President, the world has noticed your eagerness to reengage Argentina with the global community and to reassert the global leadership that, historically, Argentina has played. And we welcome that very, very much. It's good not just for the region, but it's good for the world.
I enjoyed very much our work together today, and I was extremely moved by the visit to the Metropolitan Cathedral. I was inspired by the young people who I interacted with, their talent and their optimism and their vision for the future. I understand the business forum our countries held together was fruitful; it will lead to what we both want so much for our people, which is more jobs and more opportunity. I know that our spectacular First Ladies outshone us, as they usually do, and highlighted the vital importance of opportunity and education and equality for our girls and our women.
This has all been a great reminder that the people of my country and the people of yours have so much in common. We share the same values of freedom and opportunity and a commitment to justice and human rights and rule of law. We try to live up to the example of a singular Argentinian, His Holiness Pope Francis, who I was honored to host last year at the White House, and we know that our work as nations must be about lifting up the most vulnerable and caring for the least of these and treating people as we would want ourselves to be treated. We even possess the same pioneering, frontier spirit. We have different names for it: We call it cowboys; you call it gauchos. And I've confessed that I have been intrigued to visit a country that maybe eats more red meat than the United States of America. [Laughter] That's hard to find. That's not an easy claim to take from cowboys. [Laughter]
But my hope is that, given the extraordinary history between our two countries, that this is a new beginning. I am coming to the end of my term as President of the United States. Michelle, by the way, is quite pleased about that. [Laughter] You are just getting started. But as we meet here today, what we recognize is that the opportunities and possibilities for our two countries are not bound by just two leaders. They're bound by our fellow citizens and the friendships and the bonds and the common interests that we share and that we can promote. And if we do, that will be good for the world because both of our countries have extraordinary strengths, and because we are democracies, both of our countries have the capacity to learn from some of the tragedies and pain of the past. And that makes us, I think, uniquely situated to help to promote those things that we care about so deeply.
So, in the spirit of renewed friendship and partnership and engagement, I'd like to close with the words of one of Argentina's great gifts to the world, Jorge Luis Borges, who once said, ""And now, I think that in this country we have a certain right to hope.""
I think we have a certain right to hope as a consequence of the extraordinary work we're doing today. So let me propose a toast. To Mauricio and Juliana, to the friendship between our peoples, to our inviolable right to hope: ¡Al gran pueblo Argentino, salud!
[A toast was offered.]

Ladies and gentlemen, President Aylwin and Mrs. Aylwin, Barbara and I are just delighted to welcome you both to the White House and to try to return the warm reception that you gave to me, sir, and to our daughter when we had the honor of visiting you in Chile.
Among my memories of my visit to your country was a lunch that we shared at that lovely home of yours in Santiago. And I still recall with pride and delight that you took in your children and your grandchildren. We did a little arithmetic yesterday, and between us, we have 10 children and 23 grandchildren. Perhaps we could arrange for a soccer game out on the South Lawn. [Laughter]
It has been said, Mr. President, that the greatest glory of a free-born people is to transmit that freedom to their children. Your country's bright future lies in the hands and hearts of a free-born people, determined to see their children born free, passing liberty from mother to daughter, father to son.
Today I was reminded how your father, an esteemed Supreme Court Justice, passed his love of law and liberty to his son, you, yourself a revered legal scholar. I thought of how more than 60 years ago our Louis Brandeis observed that the final end of the state was to make men free to develop their faculties. And he added that ""Those who love freedom know liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty.""
Justice Brandeis could find no better example of courage in pursuit of liberty than the Chilean people and their leader. Today, Chileans are ""free to develop their faculties"" to the fullest, having at last inherited the political and economic rights their parents worked to achieve. They've also assumed liberty's responsibilities, the knowledge that freedom taken for granted can become freedom taken away. Chile continues the hard work of freedom, defending democracy in Venezuela and Haiti and Peru, promoting peace in Central America and in the Middle East.
Mr. President, I know that Chile will continue to export its material goods. I know also it will export its dreams, the courage, hope, the imagination of free markets and free peoples. Chile teaches others that political differences never excuse indifference to the law and that social needs are better met by the invisible hand of the free market than by the iron fist of regulatory control and bureaucracy.
President Aylwin and I share a vision of free trade for all the hemisphere. The United States is now negotiating a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada as a first step toward that goal. And as a result of our discussions today and in recognition of Chile's economic accomplishments and achievements, I want to announce that the United States intends to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with Chile upon the conclusion of the North American free trade agreement. And I intend to send notification to the Congress in accord with the fast track procedures at that time.
Thirty years ago, President Eisenhower spoke to your people saying, ""We in the Western Hemisphere are still young nations still growing, still experimenting."" And I really believe that's still true today because democracy is young as our children, as all the children of the world.
Mr. President, may I propose a toast to you. And may I suggest we rise and lift our glasses: To you, Mr. President, to Mrs. Aylwin, to Chile, and to the bonds of friendship between our two people.

state-dinners,Donald J. Trump,"November 06, 2017","
Prime Minister Abe. Good evening, everyone. My name is Shinzo Abe. I'm extremely delighted to host tonight's banquet here at the State Guest House in honor of the very first visit to Japan by my dear friend, President Trump, and Madam First Lady, Ms. Melania Trump.
Yesterday's golf diplomacy between Donald and me attracted so much attention, and we actually made everything public, except for the score. And through golf, we could demonstrate to the world how strong the bond is between Japan and the United States.
But Donald and I are not the first who promoted this unique golf diplomacy. Just 60 years ago, my grandfather, Prime Minister Kishi, and President Eisenhower are the ones who initiated this tradition. And after the golf match, President Eisenhower shared two lessons with my grandfather. One, once you become a President of the United States, you need to be at the table with a group of people whom you don't like to hang out. Second, when it comes to playing golf, you can play golf only with those who you really, really like to hang out.
But speaking of my relationship with President Trump, that is not enough. If I may add another lesson to the legacy of Prime Minister Kishi and President Eisenhower, I would say it like this: When you play golf with someone not just once, but for two times, the person must be your favorite guy. So yesterday we had the pleasure of playing golf together with Mr. Hideki Matsuyama. And tonight we are so honored to have the participation of Mr. Isao Aoki, who is a pioneer in Japanese golf.
Even during the time that I played golf with President Trump, the President and I were talking about Mr. Aoki. It is all about how his putting that was something that the entire world were mesmerized. And Donald told me as follows: Mr. Aoki's putting was just, like, super, super artistic. But you should never try to do the same, because that is the only—thing that Mr. Aoki can only do, and you will not be able to do that. So next time we play golf together, I would love to have Mr. Aoki to join us and enjoy the time that I will spend with Mr. Trump.
Speaking of the First Ladies, I understand that my wife Akie and Madam First Lady had a chance to try Japanese calligraphy. Each wrote one Chinese character, or kanji: ""hei"" by Madam First Lady, which means being smooth and calm; and ""wa"" by my wife Akie, which stands for harmony. And when combined, that these two letters literally mean ""peace."" And I think their wonderful joint work represents our alliance very nicely. Under our alliance, Japan and the United States work hand in hand to contribute to regional and global peace.
For 2 days, President Trump and I spent many, many hours together, and had an in-depth discussion on various global challenges. And I'm particularly grateful for President Trump and Madam First Lady, who kindly spend their time with a former abductee and the family members of those who had been abducted by North Korea.
And it's been only 1 year since I first saw President Trump in New York City. And looking back the—over the half-century history of Japan-U.S. alliance, we've never seen two leaders of Japan and the United States forging as close relationship as ours and as strong bond in ours in just 1 year. Of course, I'm very proud of my relationship with President Trump, but we are not the only ones who have supported this invaluable friendship between Japan and the United States. And on this occasion, I would like to acknowledge tremendous efforts by leaders from various fields, including political, business, and cultural leaders who are here today.
In honor of such contribution to our invaluable friendship, I invited so many distinguished guests who have been making every effort to deepen our friendship. And I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation and also ask for further support for the development of our bilateral relationship.
Last but not least, let me share with you my honest impression about President Trump's visit to Japan this time. As I said, this was the very first visit by President Trump, and it was indeed a historic visit. And I do hope that you will enjoy your last night in Tokyo as you wish. And also, I sincerely hope that you will have a really successful trip to Asia this time, which started here in Japan.
So with that, I now would like to propose a toast wishing all the best to President Trump and Madam First Lady, and also wishing for the further development of the friendship between Japan and the United States.
Cheers!
[At this point, Prime Minister Abe offered a toast.]
Moderator. Thank you very much, Prime Minister Abe. Now may I invite President Trump to give remarks.
President Trump. Prime Minister and Mrs. Abe, this has been a really wonderful 2 days. We have to spend more time together, because I have enjoyed every minute of it, even though he's a very, very tough negotiator. And, Melania, a real friend of yours now is Mrs. Abe. And I know you enjoyed it with me. You enjoyed it in Florida, and you enjoyed it here, and maybe even more so. But I want to thank you for the royal welcome.
And it was really a—very much a working holiday, even on the golf course. So we can call it a couple of days off, but it wasn't. It was full work. Even as we played golf, all we did was talk about different things. [Laughter] We'd better not go into it. But I have to tell you, we did, and we made a lot of progress on a lot of fronts.
I do want to congratulate Mr. Aoki. He was one of the great putters, probably still is. They say you never lose your putting. When you're a great putter, you never lose your putting. But I remember a specific tournament, believe it or not, because it was one of the best I ever saw. It was the greatest putting display that I ever saw. It was you and Jack Nicklaus. Was that the U.S. Open? U.S. Open. And you would get up and sink a 30-footer. He'd get up and sink a 25-footer. And this went on for the whole back nine. And then, ultimately, Jack won by one stroke. But that was one of the greatest putting displays anybody has ever seen and there ever was. And I even know your putting stroke, very flat.
And I spoke yesterday with the great Matsuyama, who is doing great, right? He's going to be a big star, and he's going to be great. I don't even know if he's with us tonight. I don't think he's with us tonight. But he does want to get together in New York, and we're going to get together. And even though I want to have a great interpreter, but he's rapidly learning the language.
But I will tell you that it's an honor to be with you, because everyone in the world of golf talks about that one great afternoon. Just putt after putt, and it was really great. So congratulations. Great gentleman, great gentleman.
So my relationship with Shinzo got off to a quite a rocky start, because I never ran for office, and here I am. But I never ran, so I wasn't very experienced. And after I had won, everybody was calling me from all over the world. I never knew we had so many countries. [Laughter]
So I was now President-elect. But I didn't know you were supposed to not see world leaders until after you were in office, which was January 20. So you were just not supposed to, because it was considered bad form. It was not a nice thing to do, and I understand that from the standpoint of the President whose place you were taking. Okay?
[The interpreter translated President Trump's remarks.]
So you can only take so many calls from world leaders, because, you know, everybody was calling. But Japan, you take. And some others: We took Germany, we took Russia, we took China, we took your Prime Minister. Go ahead.
[The interpreter continued his translation.]
So it's November, and he said to me: ""Congratulations on your victory, it was a great victory, I would like to see you. I would like to see you as soon as possible."" And I said, ""Anytime you want, just come on in, don't worry about it."" But I was referring to after January 20. [Laughter] So I said, don't worry about it. Anytime you want, I look forward to seeing you. Just give us a call, no problem, anytime you want. And all of the sudden, I get a call from, actually, Japan press. And they said that our Prime Minister is going to New York to meet with the President-elect.
So the press is going crazy because the Prime Minister of Japan is coming to see me. I think it's absolutely fine, but I didn't really mean now. I meant some time in February, March, or April. [Laughter] Meaning, you have a very aggressive—very, very aggressive, strong, tough Prime Minister. That's a good thing, by the way, not a bad thing. [Laughter]
So then, the New York media started calling me, and I was getting all sorts of signals from Hope and Sarah, in a different position, and everybody. And they're going crazy. They're saying: ""You cannot see him. It's so inappropriate. It looks bad."" I say, ""What's wrong?"" They said: ""It's a bad thing to see him. You have to wait until after, in all fairness, Barack Obama leaves office."" And I said, ""What do I do?"" And they said, ""Let's call.""
So I called him, and he wasn't there. He was on the airplane flying to New York. [Laughter] And I said: ""You know what? There's no way he's going to land and I'm not seeing him."" So I saw him, and it worked out just fine. Do you agree with that? [Laughter] And he actually brought me the most beautiful golf club I've ever seen. It was a driver that's totally gold. Right? It's gold. [Laughter] And I looked at it, I said, ""If I ever use this driver—me—to use that driver at a golf club, I will be laughed off every course I ever go onto."" But it is the most beautiful weapon I've ever seen, so I thank you for that.
But we had a great meeting. It lasted forever. It was a very long meeting in Trump Tower. And for some reason, from that moment on, we had a really—and developed a really great relationship. And here we are today and better than ever, and we're going to work together. And it's going to get more and more special, and we're going to work out problems of Japan and problems of the United States. And it's going to be something very, very special for both countries.
And I just want to finish by saying that Melania and I today visited the palace. This is a beautiful, beautiful place. And we met two very beautiful people, the Imperial Majesties, the Emperor and the Empress, and spent a long time talking to them today. And there was a lot of love in that room for all of you people—I can tell you—from everyone from Japan. They love the people of Japan, they love this country dearly, and they have great, great respect for your Prime Minister. And they truly think that your Prime Minister did very, very well when he decided to marry—or she decided to marry him, Mrs. Abe. But they have great, great respect, I can tell you that.
And I just want to conclude by saying that our two great countries will have incredible friendship and incredible success for many centuries to come, not years, not decades, but for many centuries to come. And again, it's an honor to have you as my good friend, and I just want to thank you and Mrs. Abe. This is a very, very special 2 days. We will not forget, and we will be back soon. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"June 12, 1985","
The President. Good evening, and welcome to the White House.
Prime Minister and Mrs. Gandhi and other distinguished guests from India, it's a pleasure to have you here. Yours is among the most ancient of cultures and ours is one of the youngest. Ours is, however, the oldest constitutional democracy and yours is relatively new—38 years of age. Although young, Indian democracy has achieved strength and maturity, and today I have found that's also true of India's Prime Minister, who's just 3 years older than independent India.
And, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm happy to report to all present this evening that although a few years separate us—just a few— [laughter] —we hit it off, and just as with relations between our countries, I predict good things ahead.
Mr. Prime Minister, you were recently quoted as saying about our two countries that basically we stand for the same things—freedom, democracy, independence. And I'm sure that our meetings today reinforce that observation. To paraphrase Tolstoy, undemocratic societies are all undemocratic in their own way, but democratic societies are all alike. And so it is with India and the United States; we are ultimately so similar. And yet like family members, we often find it hard to communicate. Today we opened up personal channels of communication that will serve our countries well.
India and the United States, Mr. Prime Minister, have enormous strengths on which we can draw in seeking to improve our relations. Democracies have valuable experience in reconciling differing points of view within their own national societies. This is particularly true in our great nations, both mosaics of diverse cultures, religions, and languages. And the key to our success domestically is dialog—the quality of careful listening and serious speaking one to another. Dialog can be the key to better understanding between our nations as well.
Our meetings this week build upon the working relationship established by your late mother. Mr. Prime Minister, India and the United States have just begun to write the history of our relations. As the magnificent Festival of India will illuminate, you have enriched the world with beauty, culture, science, and philosophy. Perhaps your most precious gift to us has been the many Indians who have become proud citizens of our country. Some are here tonight, and they embody the human bond that is between us.
Being the Year of India in America, your visit and the Festival of India couldn't have been better timed. We have today set out an agenda for deepening our cooperation across a broad spectrum of issues ranging from political to economic and scientific.
This afternoon our two nations agreed to extend by an additional 3 years the very successful science and technology initiative launched as a result of my meetings with the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1982. This is one example, an important. example, of the kind of cooperation that bodes well for the future of Indo-U.S. relations.
So, let us move forward together. And with the greatest of admiration for you and the great nation you lead, I propose a toast to Indo-American friendship.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, First Lady, ladies and gentlemen, I feel privileged to be in this historic house once again. My wife and I are grateful for the warm and generous words you have spoken about India and about your meeting with my mother.
I recall the esteem that she had for you. I recall, also, the last time she was here, a wish that you had then expressed about holding a Festival of India has come true. It is good of you to dedicate that festival to Indira Gandhi's memory. We appreciate the special interest Mrs. Reagan has taken in it as patron of the U.S. national committee.
Every encounter between the peoples of the United States and India is an essay in understanding. It provides an opportunity for the reaffirmation of our commitment to personal liberty, to the rule of law, and to free expression. We both are rather outspoken people, not known for keeping quiet about what we feel and what we believe. But being candid with each other is a measure of the stability of our relationship. Both of us are animated by that capricious tolerance which marks the democratic spirit. It is one of the reasons why, in spite of some differences on policies and particulars, a firm people-to-people relationship endures between us.
It is in that spirit that we had our conversation today, at which we discussed our assessments and concerns; you have referred to some. I mentioned to you about our apprehensions at the growing militarism around the region around India, which is increasing our burdens. We have always been against outside presences and pressures, which can lead to instability. To reduce tensions in south Asia, India has taken several initiatives with its neighbors. But the success of our efforts depends very much upon what the big powers do in our region in pursuit of interests. A stable, united, peaceful India, I should think is in everyone's interest.
That is the India we are engaged in developing. For that purpose, we need peace in our neighborhood; we need peace in the world. We desire a global partnership for socioeconomic development, for the satisfaction of human needs, for the promotion of mutual understanding, and for the prevention of war.
Development and peace are closely linked. If disarmament is important for developed countries, it is even more relevant for the developing. We are appalled at the destructive fire that men have built over the years. We are concerned about the new dimensions in the arms race. The very survival of mankind today rests in the hands of a very few countries, leaving mankind to wait in fear and hope.
Six nations, including India, recently issued an appeal for disarmament. Any positive steps taken towards disarmament will be acclaimed and supported by India, the nonaligned community, and by peoples all over the world.
We welcome the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union at Geneva and hope that their deliberations will lead to positive results. Nonalignment has been a positive force for peace; it stands for friendship and cooperation with all. Any nation's independence must include the option to steer clear of bloc identification. One friendship need not be at the cost of another. We want to enlarge cooperation between our two countries in numerous fields.
India today is poised for greater growth. We have taken up plans and policies to generate new employment in our rural areas and to harness the productive energies of our young. We want the nation to benefit from the enterprise latent in our people. Growth has to be carefully calibrated so that in enlarging national production, it redresses regional imbalances and ensures social justice. This is indeed the basis of planning within our democratic system.
In three decades we have tried to catch up with what others have achieved in a century or more. We have narrowed the industrial and technological gap. Our seventh plan envisages an investment of $150 billion. We need new technology in a big way. A good part of it we will develop ourselves, but we must necessarily acquire the most advanced knowledge wherever it is generated.
The United States is preeminently the land of high technology. Recently, our two countries have reached an understanding on transfer of high technology; these arrangements must be worked out with great speed.
Mr. President, one of your great predecessors, Franklin Roosevelt, had said, ""The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today."" These words bring out the spirit of striving which marks America. Each generation must reestablish freedom and justice; each generation must respond to new situations. There is just enough time to dip in time's refreshing river. Situations change, peoples change, good ideas become dull and unexciting; sometimes they undergo distortion.
The great personalities who created modern India—Mahatma Gandhi, Jawarahal Nehru, Indira Gandhi—have taught us to be humble and firm and to persist. Our ancient book, the Bhagavad-Gita, told us, ""You have a right only to do your duty, not to the fruits thereof."" In that spirit, we shall strive.
Mr. President, I thank you again for your warm welcome and generous hospitality. We hope that you will give us the pleasure of welcoming you and Mrs. Reagan in India.
I now request you to join me in a toast to the health of President and Mrs. Reagan, to the prosperity of the American people, and to growing cooperation between our two countries in the interest of our two peoples and in the cause of a better world.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"July 10, 1993","
President and Mrs. Kim, distinguished guests: First let me, on behalf of my wife and all the Americans here present, thank you for the warm hospitality we have already received. I had a very fine meeting today with President Kim and then had the opportunity to be the guest of the Speaker at the National Assembly.
Tonight we celebrate the warm friendship between our two nations. Forty-three years ago America and the Republic of Korea joined forces to preserve freedom on the peninsula. The times then were perilous, and few could have imagined just how successful those efforts would be. Your nation's remarkable development has made Korea a model today for other nations seeking to join the ranks of the developed world. And your rising prosperity is now complemented in the leadership of President Kim by a second ""miracle on the Han,"" the flowering of democracy. President Kim, you have been an eloquent voice for democracy when democracy was not an easy thing to advocate. Your values and your valor have led the people of Korea to a new level of freedom.
And so I come, along with our party, to Korea to discuss, in the spirit of friendship, the challenges that lie ahead; to continue a dedicated partnership between our two peoples; to affirm our resolute commitment to Korea's security; and to begin a personal partnership with you, Mr. President, which I know will flourish in the years ahead.
In our separate Inaugural Addresses, Mr. President, we each invoked the image of a season of rebirth. You heralded the hope of a new spring, and I suggested a new spring of hope. Now as we enter the summer months, let us celebrate the meeting of our minds and rejoice in the warm friendship between America and Korea.
With great respect, I ask everyone here to join me in a toast to you, Mr. President, and to the Republic of Korea for peace, for democracy, for eventual unification, and for continued prosperity.
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 31, 1988","
The President. Mr. General Secretary, Mrs. Gorbachev, distinguished guests and friends, it's a pleasure to host all of you tonight and to reciprocate, in a small way, the hospitality you lavished upon us yesterday evening. While the General Secretary and I had already held three meetings before this one began here in Moscow, each of those earlier encounters took place in the autumn. The days were growing short, the weather ever grayer and colder. It makes for a bracing, delightful change to have this meeting take place at the high point of spring, a time of long, light-filled days.
I know that Nancy found her springtime visit to Leningrad earlier today both magnificent and moving. The play of light upon the rivers and canals added the special splendor of the season to a city splendid in any season. And everywhere, Nancy has told me, there was a sense of history, especially of Leningrad's immense courage and sacrifice during the Second World War, surely one of the most stirring epics in the whole human story.
Here in Moscow, I've been reminded a number of times during this springtime visit of a passage in a book about your country by Laurens Van der Post. Especially struck by the city's churches, Van der Post wrote that when he caught his first sight of the Moscow skyline he saw ""the light of an unusually pure evening upon it. That light was alchemical, and it transformed Moscow into a city of gold. The tops of the spires and pinnacles drawing the rigid forms of the skyscrapers after them into arrows of gold aimed at the arched and timeless blue."" So, we, too, have found Moscow a city of beauties. A city, especially, whose pinnacles and spires reminded one at virtually every turn of man's ancient capacity for aspiration, for reaching out toward the light.
It's a particular pleasure to be able to welcome you to Spaso House—a house of considerable beauty in its own right—the residence of our Ambassadors to the Soviet Union. During the 55 years of diplomatic relations between our two nations, Spaso House has served as one of the principal settings for exchanges between us—exchanges formal and informal alike. There have been some splendid moments within these walls. Prokofiev once conducted his marvelous ""The Love for Three Oranges"" in this very room. As wartime allies, our representatives met often under this roof. And Ambassador and Mrs. Matlock have continued the tradition of making Spaso House a centerpiece of American culture, a place to receive and talk with Soviet officials and with people from all walks of life and from all parts of the Soviet Union. But there have also been quiet times in this house—unnaturally quiet times. Times when difficult relations between us meant that this house, this huge, magnificent house, stood virtually empty of visitors. I'm told that it was even possible to hear the Moscow Metro rumbling past, ever so faintly, deep in the Earth below.
Mr. General Secretary, we know that on matters of great importance we will continue to differ profoundly, and yet you and I have met four times now, more often than any previous President and General Secretary. While our discussions have sometimes been pointed or contentious, we possess an enlarged understanding of each other and of each other's country. On specific matters of policy, we have made progress, often historic progress. And perhaps most important, we have committed our nations to continuing to work together, agreeing that silence must never again be permitted to fall between us. We have agreed always to continue the interchanges between our nations because, I believe, we both hear the same voice, the same overwhelming imperative. What that voice says can be expressed in many ways. But I have found it in vivid form in Pasternak's poem ""The Garden of Gethsemane."" Listen, if you will, to Pasternak's account of that famous arrest:
""There appeared—no one knew from where—a crowd of slaves and a rabble of knaves, with lights and swords and, leading them, Judas with a traitor's kiss on his lips.
""Peter repulsed the ruffians with his sword and cut off the ear of one of them. But he heard: 'You cannot decide a dispute with weapons; put your sword in its place, O man.'""
That's the voice. ""Put your sword in its place, O man."" That is the imperative, the command. And so, we will work together that we might forever keep our swords at our sides.
Mr. General Secretary, ladies and gentlemen, Spaso House has, as I said, seen quiet times, yet the animated conversation of this evening has already done much to make up for them. And so, I would like to raise a glass to the continued interchange between our two nations and, if I may, to Spaso House itself, as a symbol of our relations. May this lovely home never lack for visitors and shared meals and the sounds of spirited conversation and even the peal of hearty laughter. Thank you, and God bless you. And to the General Secretary, to Mrs. Gorbachev, to the relationship that I believe must continue.
The General Secretary. Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, comrades: I thank you, Mr. President for the words of greeting you just addressed to us.
Two great nations have given the two of us a mandate to determine what Soviet-American relations should be like. Since our first meeting in Geneva, relations between our two countries have overcome a long, drawn out period of confrontation to reach an acceptable level from which it is now easier to move forward. In Reykjavik, in Washington, and during this present visit of yours, our dialog has been intense. Its most important result has been the now-ratified first treaty to reduce nuclear weapons. A search is continuing to find a solution for problems relating to 50-percent cuts in strategic offensive arms. The Geneva accord in Afghanistan has come into force. We now have as many as 47 bilateral agreements on cooperation.
The visit by a President of the United States to the Soviet Union is an occasion for a glance at the past and a look into the future. The history of relations between our two countries has known all kinds of things, good and bad. Of the good things, we remember particularly well the Soviet-American comradeship-in-arms in World War II. Those grim years saw the emergence of the first shoots of Soviet-American friendship. And there was not one single Soviet citizen who did not feel bitter when that glorious page in the history of our relations gave way to cold war. That was a hard test for our peoples. The world found itself in a dangerous situation. We all felt the breath of impending catastrophe. Even today, we're sometimes chilled by cold winds.
But world developments in their main tendency are turning toward a search for political solutions, toward cooperation and peace. We are, all of us, witnesses to momentous changes, though a lot still has to be done to achieve irreversible change. Although everything urges cooperation and trust, prejudices and stereotypes are still with us, as is rivalry, above all in the military sphere. A great deal has been said at this meeting, too, about how pointless and catastrophic it is. More importantly, we can register some headway toward better mutual understanding in this area as well.
Today, I would like to address another major world problem: the situation in the developing world, which cannot but affect our countries, too. The problems which the developing countries face have turned out to be difficult [to] the point of tragedy. Glaring backwardness, hunger, poverty, and mass diseases continue to beset entire nations. An incredibly high debt has become an excruciating and universal problem. It would seem that everybody can see its complexity, involving as it does extremely diverse and truly vital interests, and understand that a way out must be solved.
We believe that if the international community and, above all, the great powers are to be of any help the starting point and the essential thing is to recognize unconditionally the freedom of choice. We are insisting on fairness. We have seriously studied the economic system in developing nations, and I am convinced that a way out is possible along the lines of a radical restructuring of the entire system of world economic relations, without any discrimination for political reasons. This would promote a political settlement of regional conflicts which not only impede progress in that part of the world but also cause turmoil in the entire world situation. With such an approach, our differences as to what kind of a future awaits the Third World would not take on confrontational forms. So, in this matter, too, our relationship is doomed to have an international dimension.
Turning now to our bilateral relations, we envision there opportunities and prospects primarily in light of internal evolution in both countries, but also in the context of world developments. Many Americans who are studying us and who have visited the U.S.S.R., and now, I hope, those present here as well, have been able to see for themselves the sweeping scope of change in our country. It is based on comprehensive democratization and radical economic reform. I'm gratified to note that today the President and I have had an in-depth exchange of views on this subject. We have also discussed our perestroika a number of times with other Americans. This is all to the good. It, too, is a sign of change in our relationship.
We, for our part, are trying to closely follow the profound trends in the United States. We see how little similarity there is between what is happening in our country and in yours, in two very different societies based on different values. But we do not regard this as an obstacle to identifying promising areas for mutually beneficial ties or for cooperation in the interests of the two peoples. We're in favor of competition and comparison.
And another thing, whatever the ups and downs of our dialog with America, Soviet representatives have been upholding the interests of the Soviet state. In their contacts with us, American officials have been acting in exactly the same way, vis-a-vis their own interests. The truth is that in building their relationship the Soviet Union and the United States can effectively serve their own interests only if they have a realistic view and take account of each other's interests and intentions. We must learn the difficult art of not just existing side by side but of building bridges of mutually beneficial cooperation.
Soviet and American people want to live in peace and communicate in all areas in which they have a mutual interest. The interest is there, and it is growing. We feel no fear. We are not prejudiced. We believe in the value of communication. I see a future in which the Soviet Union and the United States base their relations on disarmament, a balance of interest, and comprehensive cooperation rather than on deterring each other or upgrading their military capabilities. I see a future in which solutions to real problems are not impeded by problems historically outdated or artificially kept alive, inherited from the times of the cold war, and in which the policies of confrontation give way to a joint quest based on reason, mutual benefit, and readiness to compromise. I see a future in which our two countries, without claiming any special rights in the world, are always mindful of their special responsibility in a community of equal nations. It'll be a world that is safer and more secure, which is so badly needed by all people on Earth, by their children and grandchildren, so that they could gain and preserve the basic human rights: the right to life, work, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. The path towards this future can be neither easy nor short. We may be standing at the threshold of a uniquely interesting period in the history of our two nations. This new meeting between the two of us, Mr. President, confirms that 3 years ago in Geneva we took the right decision.
May the years to come bring a healthier international environment. May life be triumphant. To the very good health of the President, to the very good health of Mrs. Nancy Reagan, to cooperation between our two peoples.

state-dinners,Donald J. Trump,"November 07, 2017","
President Moon. Tomorrow marks the 1-year anniversary of President Trump's election victory. In Korea, we have a custom of holding a special celebration on one's first birthday. So after pondering about how to best celebrate the first anniversary of President Trump's victory, I decided to invite the President to Korea as a state guest and hold a banquet. [Laughter] Ladies and gentlemen, another big round of applause to congratulate President Trump.
I would like to extend my heartfelt welcome to President and Mrs. Trump, both of whom I highly respect, on their first visit to Korea. This is the first state visit by an American President in 25 years and the first state visit for me and my administration. I am very pleased to get this opportunity to repay so quickly the hospitality I received in Washington, DC, last June. Over the months, I have maintained close contact with President Trump. But now, after spending a day with the President and the First Lady within Cheong Wa Dae, I feel a sense of intimacy, as if we were old friends.
Distinguished guests, last September, in his keynote speech to the U.N. General Assembly, President Trump recollected President Truman's great initiatives for rebuilding the free world in the aftermath of World War II. Thanks to President Truman's resolute decision, the U.S.-led U.N. forces participated in the war that broke out on the Korean Peninsula. The R.O.K.-U.S. alliance was born out of the same red blood of patriots split—spilt by Korean and American soldiers on the battlefield.
Last June, I paid my respects at the Chosin Reservoir Battle memorial in Quantico. I convey my gratitude to the Korean war veterans for their honorable sacrifices and reflect upon the noble values of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance that has defended freedom and peace.
Even at this very moment, the peace of my country, which was won with blood, is being threatened once again. But the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance gives us the strength to stop this threat. Camp Humphreys, where President Trump visited today, is the largest and most advanced U.S. military installation outside of the United States, and it is a symbol of the enduring strength of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance.
Ladies and gentlemen, war must not break out again on the Korean Peninsula. And in this respect, the United States has provided enormous support. The close coordination between Korea and the United States and the overwhelming superiority of power that stems from the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance will eventually make North Korea cease its reckless provocations and make North Korea come out to dialogue for denuclearization. The R.O.K.-U.S. alliance of tomorrow will grow into a trustworthy pillar that guarantees the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and also builds peace and prosperity in all of Northeast Asia.
Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump's election victory 1 year ago is already making America great again. Korea faces the task of making this world a better place through cooperation with a great America. Korea has worked with the United States for peace and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are also working hand in hand with the United States to realize the common values of humanity, such as human rights and the eradication of poverty. I believe that making such joint efforts will make the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance an even greater alliance as President Trump and I have agreed to do last June and, at the same time, make America even greater.
Thank you.
Now I would like to propose a toast. Please fill your glasses, and may I ask you to raise your glasses. If you are ready: I give you my word that I will always stand by you on our journey to make the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance an even greater alliance. I congratulate President Trump on the 1-year anniversary of his election victory. And I would like to propose a toast to the good health of President and Mrs. Trump.
[At this point, President Moon offered a toast.]
Moderator. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome U.S. President Donald Trump. He will also propose a toast.
President Trump. Well, thank you very much. And this is an exciting time, and we're going to have an exciting day tomorrow, for many reasons that people will find out, in addition to the fact, I look forward to making a—hopefully—very comprehensive speech before you and the leaders of Korea. And that will be really something that I'm representing the American people. The relationship that we have is a fantastic one.
And I have to say, President Moon and First Lady Kim, thank you very much. I greatly appreciate your hosting Melania and myself on our first trip to the very beautiful Republic of Korea. We were honored to welcome you to the White House this past summer, and now it's a tremendous honor to visit your magnificent home—and magnificent it is—to see this beautiful land, and to meet the remarkable people of South Korea.
The partnership between our two nations and our two people is deep and enduring. We have been proud to stand by your side for many decades as an unwavering friend and a loyal ally. And you have never had a time where this ally has been more loyal or stood by your side more than right now.
Here in South Korea, the people built a free, sovereign, and democratic republic. Through their resilience and sacrifice and determination, they became the chief architects of the future. Today, the course of this great nation is charted solely by the free people of South Korea. Mr. President, your remarkable success truly demonstrates what is possible when people are free to follow their dreams, pursue their passions, and hope for a better future for their children. Tonight we celebrate South Korea's success and reaffirm our close and abiding bonds of friendship.
Together, our nations remind the world of the boundless potential of societies that choose freedom over tyranny, and who set the free. And we will free, and we will sacrifice, and we will hope, and we will make things beautiful, especially the aspiration of your people. As true partners, we have remained faithful friends through periods of challenge and opportunity. And that's what we have now, is great opportunity. We will continue to support each other in the years ahead.
In that spirit, I would like to offer a toast to President Moon and First Lady Kim and to the people of South Korea: May freedom and peace flourish on this peninsula. In our time, and for generations to come, this will be a special evening and a special time. May our bonds of friendship continue to deepen, and may the cherished hopes of our people and the people across the region soon be realized. Mr. President, may your dreams come true. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you very much.
[President Trump offered a toast.]

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"June 17, 1974","
Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, and all of your distinguished guests:
First, Your Majesty, may I express my deep gratitude on behalf of the Nation I represent for the award you have just presented to me. And I can assure you that it will be on display at the White House for the thousands of visitors to see, who come through those rooms and who, when they see it, will recognize how important we in the United States consider friendship with Jordan to be. And I am grateful for the fact that this award, which I understand goes only to heads of state, is one that you have seen fit to present on this occasion.
Also, I would like to tell you how touched Mrs. Nixon and I have been by the reception we have received in our visit to Jordan. As you know, this is the first time I have been to this country. It is not because of a lack of desire on the part of either of us not to have come sooner, because we would have liked to, but it is only because our schedules did not permit at an earlier time.
And I can only say that never have we had what we thought was a warmer reception from the hearts of the people as we drove through the streets of Amman, a city with a great past and a city and a country with an equally great future. It is called the City of the Seven Hills, and I only wish that we had a chance to explore more than just three, which has been our lot to date.
And so, we will have to come back some day so that we can go to those many places of historical interest which I know attract tourists from all over the world, come back so that we can see them and perhaps again enjoy another visit with you.
And let me also, on behalf of your American guests particularly and, I think, perhaps all of your guests tonight in the diplomatic corps and your guests from Jordan, express appreciation for the splendid musical entertainment that we have had. As I listened to it, I could not believe my ears. I thought that some way we had imported the United States Marine Corps Band which plays, as you know, Your Majesty, in the White House for the state dinners which you have attended so often while we have been there. And as they played favorites from all nations, but several from American musical comedies, I can assure you that their ability as musicians, but particularly their ability to play in any idiom, and particularly ours, in a way that we understood it, was enormously impressive. And you made us feel very much at home, and they did with that splendid performance, which incidentally we could hear but not see, but it is right out that door, I understand. It was not a record player.
Your Majesty, you have spoken of your first visit to the United States, and I remember it well. I have mentioned on the occasions of your visits since I have been President what President Eisenhower thought of you at that time. Nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, 15 years ago, when you were a very young king-you still are a very young king,' but very mature and very wise because of the years you have been a king, a king all of your adult life--but you were only 23 then, and I remember that President Eisenhower afterwards told me and he has been known to be a very good judge of men--he told me that he was enormously impressed with what he called the quiet inner strength that the King of Jordan had. Little did he know or did we know at that time how often that inner strength would be called upon to save this country. And I know, however, that before his death he saw that evaluation vindicated.
I have seen it vindicated, and I can say tonight, looking through the pages of history since you have been King of this country, that but for the strong courageous leadership of His Majesty, the King of Jordan, this country would not be in existence today. And we in the free world are all proud and respectful of the leadership you have given. And that is one of the reasons why in our friendship with Jordan it is one that does not just begin now, it is one that goes back to the time that Jordan became the state that it presently is. It is one that has continued throughout the period of your reign as King, and it is one, I can assure you, Your Majesty, that will continue now and in the future.
Because as we travel abroad in these years and make what we hope will be new friends, new friends, for example, in mainland China, the People's Republic of China, Soviet Union, and new friends in this part of the world, in the Mideast, let us always remember that we do not forget our old friends. We remember that the friendship that has bound us together has served us both well, and you can be sure that that friendship will always continue as long as we have an opportunity to have the kind of discussions that have characterized our relationships since I have held this office and, I am sure, will characterize them whoever may be the President in the years to come when, I trust, you will still be the King of this country.
You have spoken of the journey that we have taken, and, Your Majesty, you have very properly and, I may say, in very good grace have mentioned some difficult problems that remain unsolved. And I wish this evening that I could have brought with me a briefcase full of solutions and I could have laid them out on this table, because there is nothing in my heart that I want more, nothing that the American people want more than a solution to these problems that not only have brought war four times to this troubled area of the world in the last 30 years but also these problems which have divided the United States from many of its traditional friends in what is called the Arab world.
And so, while I cannot tonight, and will not be able tomorrow in the meetings that we will have to discuss these situations in more detail, offer solutions at this time, I can tell you that, just as you said in every conversation that I have had, the problems that you have raised have been discussed with me and in great detail--the problems of the Palestinians, the problem of Jerusalem, the problem of borders, the problems that we could go on and list, perhaps, at even greater length.
But the fact that all of these problems do not have solutions at this time is no cause for despair. What would be cause for despair would be if the people in these nations and the leaders of the nations in this area were to go back to the old ways, and the old way was to dig in, freeze into place, and wait for another conflict to break loose.
There is one thing that the last 25 years or 30 years have proved, and that is that another war will not solve the problems to which you have referred. That has been tried and it has not succeeded--and I am not suggesting who tried, where or why or how the fault might have been, but war is not a solution and cannot be a solution to problems as intricate as this, not at this period in the history of this area.
And that is why we feel on our part, and I know, Your Majesty, from our discussions that you share this view, that we must try another way. We must try the path of peace.
You have urged this upon me from the time you first called upon me as President back in 1969. And the United States, I must say, has not played a decisive and, in some cases, has not played an effective role in the Mideast in attempting to move on the path of solving these problems through peaceful means.
But the new element that has been added, the new element that has been symbolized by this journey which you have referred to, the new element that certainly was not only symbolized but showed actual results in addition, in the long negotiations which were undertaken by Secretary Kissinger in the Mideastern area-one leading to the disengagement on the Israeli-Egyptian front and another on the Syrian-Israeli front--the one new element is that the United States now has made a decision that we will undertake not to impose a settlement because we are not the best ones from the outside. No one from the outside knows what is best as far as a settlement is concerned. But we will undertake, where the nations in the area-and this seems to be the case at this time--. where the nations in the area want us to, we will undertake to use our influence and use it effectively to bring leaders of nations who have disagreements on such critical issues as you have discussed tonight, bring them together and try to find fair and just solutions to these problems.
And so tonight, I do not tell you where this journey will end. I cannot tell you when it will end. The important thing is that it has begun.
You said earlier, Your Majesty, that this was the last stop. Let me tell you, it is the last stop on this trip, but it is only the beginning of the journey for peace, because what we have found is that despite the important first steps that we have taken, they are only a beginning. We have a long way to go, and this trip is simply another step, a step in which understanding has been created where there was misunderstanding before, where new relations have been created where there were no relations before and where an American presence, where it is desired by both parties concerned or all parties concerned, is there to be used and used effectively.
And so, as I look to the future, I would say this is no time to be certainly Pollyannaish about what the future may be. These problems are difficult. The divisions are deep, and some of them go back over many, many years. But also, this is a time when there can and must and should be hope--hope because of this new element that has been brought into it, not simply because it is the United States, but because our particular role in the world at this time in the world's history is one that I think we have demonstrated is a peacemaker role, whether in Asia or in Europe or anywhere else.
To me the greatest challenge to American foreign policy, even greater than ending the war in Vietnam in an honorable way, which was essential for our further foreign policy successes, even greater than the challenge that was confronted when we had the opening to the leaders of those who led over one-fourth of all the people of the world, the People's Republic of China, even greater than opening a new dialog with those who led the great super power, the Soviet Union, is this very complex and difficult problem which we find here in the Mideast, because it is not one nation, it is several. It is not one single problem, there are several.
And there are differences of opinions among the people, among the leaders, among the nations on so many of these problems. And it is this reason, therefore, Your Majesty, that I do not talk tonight simply with that easy optimism that will lull everyone into a false sense of security, but that I do talk with a confidence based on what I think are some new developments that have reason to give us hope.
And I can assure you that we on our part will do all that we can to keep the momentum going, because it must continue until we come to what we might term the end of the journey. And the end will not be reached until we are satisfied that a just and durable peace, one that will last, has been established in this part of the world.
Finally, Your Majesty, let me say that I look forward to our talks tomorrow. This is a small nation, but it is headed, as I indicated earlier, by a very courageous leader and also, I have learned, by a very wise leader. Your Majesty has proved to be, in every talk I have had with him, one who is understanding of the problems of those who oppose him, one who understands the issues of the whole area, one who is fair, one who sees things not simply from one side but from the other side as well.
Sometimes the word ""moderate"" is used, and it is used in a condemning way. But I would say it is this kind of responsible leadership--strong, responsible, call it moderate if you want--that is going to lead to that peace that both of our nations and all the nations in this area seek.
And so with that, I know that all of you will want to join me in responding to the toast which has been given by His Majesty, by speaking, first, of the traditional Jordanian-American friendship which was strong already and will be even stronger after our meetings and speaking, second, of the new relationship of friendship which has been established between the United States and what is called the Arab world, although that is a statement that perhaps oversimplifies a more complex area than that. But there is a new relationship and a good and positive one that has developed with Egypt and with Syria that was not there before.
And finally, and above all, to a man who has had the vision from the time he was a very young king, a man who has kept that visions-even when in the year 1970 it seemed that his whole world and his whole nation was coming down around him--a man who had the vision of a permanent and just peace in the Mideast. I know that we would want to raise our glasses and drink to the health of His Majesty, the King, and to the Queen.

Mr. President and Mrs. Kufuor and family members; members of the Cabinet; Mr. Vice President; Members of Congress; distinguished guests: Thank you all for coming. Laura and I are really happy to host you tonight. And we're particularly happy to host President Kufuor and Mrs. Kufuor. After all, we were in their country last February, and it was a unbelievable visit in spite of my lousy dancing. [Laughter] Mrs. Kufuor was my partner, and she can testify to my lousy dancing. [Laughter]
The memories of the trip will always stay with us, Mr. President. It was a great experience. You're the President of a country of such great potential, and you're President of a country of such wonderful people.
We really do want to—I hope you relax tonight for this special evening. After dinner we'll go out to the Rose Garden for a—interesting entertainment.
John and I will be joining the ex-Presidents club in a couple of months. [Laughter] But I am confident we have left behind an enduring relationship between our two countries. We are—we've worked hard to help the people of Ghana. Because of his integrity and because of his leadership, I was confident in proposing the Millennium Challenge Account for the country of Ghana.
We're working hard to fight disease together. In this room are compassionate people who care deeply about the citizens of your country, John. And we want to thank you for your compassion and thank you for coming. We care deeply about the education of people all across the globe. John, you've helped your people build a thriving democracy, where the rule of law is respected. And as well, you've taken a leadership role on the continent of Africa.
I thank you for your wise counsel and your judgment on how the United States can work to promote peace. I really have greatly enjoyed serving with you in an historic era. I have confidence that the next Presidents of both our countries will be able to work together.
In the meantime, I offer you a toast. I wish you all the best in your retirement. I have loved being in your presence. And so a toast to the President, and his gracious wife Theresa, and the people of Ghana.

Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Kaur, Laura and I are honored to welcome you to the White House. It is a great privilege to have you here, along with our distinguished guests tonight.
India and the United States are separated by half the globe. Yet today, our two nations are closer than ever before. The ties that bind us are enriched by the hundreds of thousands of Americans of Indian origin. These citizens contribute a lot to America's vitality. Today, these Americans are leaders in their professions in business and science, in space exploration and technology, and in many other fields. And the United States is a better place because of the thousands of students who come here from India to study in our universities.
Today, our two nations are bound by our common interests. Our trading partnership has grown dramatically in recent years, which brings greater prosperity and opportunity to citizens of both our countries. America and India also understand the danger of global terrorism, which has brought grief to our nations and united us in our desire to bring peace and security to the world.
Above all, India and the United States are bound together by common values. As two strong, diverse democracies, we share a commitment to the success of multiethnic democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law. And we believe that by spreading the blessings of democracy and freedom, we will ensure lasting peace for our own citizens and for the world.
Last year, Mr. Prime Minister, you said that the best is yet to come in the relationship between India and the United States. The good meetings we have had today demonstrate your foresight. America looks forward to working even more closely with India in the coming years to spread prosperity and freedom and peace.
And so tonight, Mr. Prime Minister, as we celebrate the friendship of our two nations, I offer a toast to you, to your gracious wife, and to the great people of India.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"April 10, 1984","
President Reagan. President and Mrs. Jorge Blanco, ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure to have you as our guests this evening.
President Jorge Blanco and his lovely wife represent a country rich in history, blessed with natural beauty, and filled with creative and robust people. This morning at the welcoming ceremony, I mentioned the great accomplishments of your people. And, Mr. President, you can be rightfully proud of your country's freedom.
Eugenio Maria de Aostos, a writer from the last century, truly a man of the hemisphere, once wrote, ""No one knows better the meaning of justice and freedom than those who have lived under despotism."" Well, such is the case of those who lead the Dominican Republic today. In our lifetime, through your efforts and those of good people like you, the Dominican Republic has been rescued from tyranny and brought safely into the family of free nations. Your personal commitment to the high ideals of liberty, Mr. President, is exemplary.
There can be no greater vocation for any statesman than to lead his people to a more free, just, and humane society. In pursuit of that vocation, you have set a standard of statesmanship and patriotism which is a model not only for the Caribbean but for the Western Hemisphere—indeed, for the leader of any country seeking to create a climate of dignity and freedom in which the human spirit can flourish.
This is not to suggest that under a free government there are no problems. One of the perplexing difficulties, as we're both fully aware, Mr. President, is ensuring economic growth and progress. World events totally beyond our control can dramatically change the rules of the game. Such was the case with energy costs during the last decade. Maintaining healthy economic growth in the face of rising energy costs has been a major challenge to democratic governments throughout the world. Progress can no longer be taken for granted, but, instead, requires constant diligence and a commitment to the long-run well-being of a country.
Yet there's no reason that, working together, free people cannot triumph over adversity today just as we have in the past. Juan Pablo Duarte, the great Dominican patriot, said it well: ""Let us work for the country,"" he wrote, ""for in so doing we work for Ourselves and for our children.""
President Blanco, your government is today ensuring a better tomorrow. You're meeting the challenge head on, working diligently to rebuild your economy through fiscal responsibility and courageous reform in public administration. You've improved your country's business and investment climate. And by stressing the importance of the private sector, and by providing practical incentives for investment, you've made certain the Dominican Republic will be part of the economic upsurge now taking place in the United States, as it spreads throughout the global economy.
Some of you may not be aware that President Blanco, in his country, has established enterprise zones to encourage investment and commerce. Mr. President, perhaps you've got some tips on how to get great ideas like that— [laughter] —through the legislative process here in Washington. Seriously, though, Mr. President, the strength of Dominican democracy have not gone unnoticed by our Congress. Your support and the example of a strong Dominican democracy deserve credit for helping assure the passage of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. You proved that there is a better way, and it works.
Together we can show the world that, indeed, freedom works. Together—well, it's up to us. President Jorge Blanco, we honor you tonight for the part that you and your country are playing in the cause of human freedom.
Now, if you will all join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Jorge Blanco, and to the Dominican Republic. President Jorge Blanco. President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen:
This dinner will be permanently engraved in my memory, as it will be in that of my wife and of the members of our delegation. Henceforth, we can include it among the most stellar moments of our lives.
Over and above protocol, we feel the warmth and affection of President Reagan, his gracious wife, Nancy, and the high officials of this nation who receive us as emissaries of the democracy which we represent with genuine pride.
We are pleased to see once again that the Dominican democracy is respected and admired by the great democracy of the United States of America. We are both associated with and agree upon the defense of the human values which gave birth to our respective nations. We share a common past of ideals and principles, and a present full of responsibilities which must contribute to the building of a more promising future for our people.
I appreciate your recognition of the democratic vocation of our people and of the firm resolve of the government we are fortunate to head to fight tenaciously, with unswerving faith and will, for maintenance of a democratic system, in spite of the adversities of an unprecedented world economic crisis which affects all of the international community, but more so the developing countries.
From the very moment I took office I set a clear and precise target: to restore the economy and the finances of the Dominican nation to health. We are devoting major efforts and sacrifices to this unpostponable objective, conscious of the fact that a house in order and the adoption of policies that are conducive to sustained development and of reform measures that will ensure a true system of social justice, are indispensable prerequisites for the strengthening and full effectiveness of our democratic institutions.
The Presidency of a country, be it large or small, is a forge where leadership is hammered out, in the awareness of the resources and aspirations of their peoples. That is why we do not hesitate to support and defend the generous program of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which has already become reality and serves as a means to expand our markets, at the same time that it constitutes a great stimulus for private enterprise, a constant and necessary engine for the development of our societies.
I sincerely hope that our talks will lead to appropriate and fair solutions to common problems and will guarantee positive achievements for the development of our economies and the prosperity of our nations.
[At this point, President Jorge Blanco departed from the prepared text of his remarks. He then proposed a toast as follows.]
Let us drink a toast to the personal good fortune of the President and his distinguished wife. Let us drink a toast to the happiness of our respective peoples.
Interpreter. There was a part of the President's remarks that were improvised, and I'd like to transmit, to those of you who didn't understand, the English—what he said.
""President Reagan, I have been deeply moved by your mention of Eugenio Maria de Aostos and Juan Pablo Duarte. Eugenio Maria de Aostos was the teacher par excellence of all successive generations of Dominicans as the years have gone by. Juan Pablo Duarte, together with other two great patriots, was the founder of our modern republic. But the mention of the name of Juan Pablo Duarte here in this room at the White House is an extraordinary recognition of the ideals that have shaped our nation throughout the years, and which led to the independence movement which led, in turn, to our independence declared on the 27th of February of 1844.
""Into this beautiful room have come men. They have come to share the warmth with the beautiful ladies who've accompanied them, and with all of their beautiful dresses. And this, undoubtedly, will be an indelible part of the recollection that we have of this evening. But above all, Mr. President, the warm welcome that you have given us, on behalf of the great American democracy of which you are a worthy leader and to which you bring so much prestige, fills every one of the aspirations that we might have had when we came to this city. And the fruitful results of our conversations will be the golden touch that will accompany us upon our return to our country.""
Thank you.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"October 14, 1987","
President Reagan. It's been a pleasure to have you, President and Mrs. Duarte, and all of you as our guests this evening at the White House. This year is the 200th anniversary of the Constitution of the United States. It's appropriate then that we have as our guest an elected leader who has laid the foundations for freedom in his country and whose courage and strength of conviction are an inspiration to us all. President Duarte, having fought the brutality and repression of left and right, has come to symbolize the struggle for democracy in this hemisphere.
I have little doubt that our forefathers, who sacrificed so much to secure the blessings of liberty for the United States, would see President Duarte as one of their own. Thomas Jefferson, who walked these very halls, once described what it is all about: ""Freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus and trial by juries impartially selected,"" he wrote, ""these principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us."" Well, this is the same bright constellation whose majestic light President Duarte would shine on El Salvador. As our Founding Fathers came to know, winning liberty and establishing democratic institutions are not without great personal sacrifice.
In 1972 President Duarte won an election but was prevented from assuming the office and forced into exile. Years of frustration followed. Then there was the immense pressure President Duarte found himself under when he returned to his country in 1979. It would have broken a lesser man.
One of the most moving moments of my Presidency was the visit to the Oval Office made by President Duarte and his daughter, Inez, shortly after her release from kidnapers 2 years ago. This terrible travail was part of the personal price President Duarte has paid to help secure the freedom of his country. Yet tonight can anyone doubt President Duarte has not only survived, he has triumphed. He's proven himself one of those rare individuals who will be remembered by his people and by people throughout the hemisphere as a hero of freedom.
In the last century, another such hero was Jose Simeon Canas, champion of Salvadoran independence, the Abraham Lincoln of his country. This moral giant, seriously ill, made an impassioned speech against slavery to the Salvadoran Congress. In it he said: even if dying, he had to speak out for powerless people. ""I ask,"" he said, ""before everything else, that all our brethren be declared free.""
This is the kind of spirit I see in President Duarte. It's been my honor over these years to have known him and worked with him, to have assisted, where possible, his efforts and those of the brave Salvadoran people to win peace, establish democratic institutions, and, before anything else, to declare all our brethren free. President Duarte, God, unity, and freedom—the spirit of El Salvador, the spirit of all the citizens of the hemisphere. So, I ask all of you to join with me in toasting President Duarte, Mrs. Duarte, and the people of El Salvador.
President Duarte. When you were telling, Mr. President, all those beautiful things of what you have valued, what we're doing in our country, and when I was enjoying this wonderful dinner tonight, I was seeing that picture there, the picture of Abraham Lincoln. And I wonder why he has his hand here and his face firm? What was happening in his own heart when he was the President of a country who was struggling? He was seeing not only slaves, he was seeing war—hate in the heart. And this wonderful man had love in his heart. He never hated anybody. He wanted to have his country free, and he even gave his life for that. That picture to me is a symbol of this country. It's a symbol of you, Mr. Reagan, the President of the United States, the President of this country who is doing the best so that other countries can also have what you have dear in this country, which is freedom and democracy.
Let me be simple and ask you to just raise your head and give a prayer for my people of my country, for the poor people, for the suffering people of my country, and also for the soldiers who die and the guerrillas who will also die. We all are Salvadorans, and we all want peace.
So, Mr. President, let me raise and ask you to raise your hand with me to a toast to President Reagan—to a toast to Mr. Reagan, to Mrs. Reagan, and to a toast to the American people.

state-dinners,George Bush,"January 08, 1992","
Mrs. Bush. Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Miyazawa, I rarely get to speak for George Bush. But tonight I know he would want me to thank you, on behalf of the members of his administration and the American businessmen who are here, for a wonderful visit and for a great friendship, in my part, for a lovely day, and I think for a wonderful day for all of you.
You know, I can't explain what happened to George because it never happened before. But I'm beginning to think it's the Ambassador's fault. [Laughter] He and George played the Emperor and the Crown Prince in tennis today, and they were badly beaten. And we Bushes aren't used to that. [Laughter] So, he felt much worse than I thought. [Laughter]
But General Scowcroft is going to speak for the President. And thank you very much for a wonderful visit.
Mr. Scowcroft. Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great honor on behalf of the President, and without his assured elegance, to deliver the remarks he was going to make. May I first, Mr. Prime Minister, on his behalf, thank you for your very kind words, your expressions of solidarity, hope, and friendship.
Prime Minister Miyazawa, Deputy Prime Minister Watanabe, distinguished ministers, distinguished former Prime Ministers, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Prime Minister, it is already clear from our discussions that we share much in common. Most important, we both want stronger ties, better trade, and a closer friendship between our two countries.
Barbara and I are honored to be here. I am proud to join you in welcoming the season of the new year and to look ahead with honesty and understanding to the era of a new century.
Mr. Prime Minister, let me offer my very warmest congratulation on your election. I sincerely look forward to the work that lies together before us. As you remarked earlier this year, the United States and Japan share the same values and bear a heavy responsibility for world order. It is my conviction that the United States and Japan must move forward together as partners. We share a common vision for the post-cold-war world, a world knitted together by a global trading system with common rules making possible free and equitable competition.
Kiichi, I know our people share a love of baseball, so perhaps we should think of this new world in this spirit. You've called your country a team player, a description I would also apply to America. So let's compete in the arena of free and open trade. Open competition and close cooperation will make both our countries winners. Working together, no two nations can do more to realize a new era of peace and prosperity than Japan and the United States.
You once spoke of the need to create an economy for the benefit of mankind and to challenge the unknown. So now, let us join together. Let us forge a global partnership as we confront the challenges of the coming century. For the sake of our children, for the sake of their children, we must not let these opportunities slip through our fingers.
Mr. Prime Minister, I hear you are fond of the phrase ""large trees with deep roots."" Let us guard the growing tree of our friendship so that it may shelter all the generations to come.
To this friendship, I raise my glass.

President Obama. On behalf of my—Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. And welcome to the final state dinner of my Presidency. But in the immortal words of a great Italian American, Yogi Berra, ""It ain't over till it's over."" And so we have a wonderful evening ahead of us as we celebrate the great alliance between the United States and Italy with our great friends, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Mrs. Agnese Landini.
Now, I have to say, this is a remarkable crowd. I will confess that, at first, I was a little nervous about this dinner. After all, Matteo is called Il Rottamatore—The Scrapper, The Demolition Man. [Laughter] And Roberto Benigni is here as well, and he has promised not to jump on the tables. [Laughter] Ask any Italian or Italian American, and they'll tell you that the dinners can get somewhat animated. People can get excited, especially if your grandmother thinks you're not eating enough. And so Michelle and I decided to just think of this as a typical Italian Sunday dinner: surrounded by family and great friends—paisans—and pasta.
But tonight we're reminded that American democracy has been graced by the touch of Italy. Our declaration that ""all men are created equal"" was penned by Thomas Jefferson, and it was a concept shared by his friend, also from Florence, Firenze, Filippo Mazzei. We stand before the Lincoln Memorial and see the work of the Piccirilli brothers. We look up at the dome of the U.S. Capitol and marvel at the touch of Brumidi. Then again, some days our Presidential campaigns can seem like Dante's ""Inferno."" [Laughter]
Most of all, we see the spirit of Italy—and the friendships between our people—in so many proud Italian Americans. I suspect that many of you here tonight are thinking of your own families—parents, grandparents, great-grandparents—who left the old country, who toiled and sacrificed and gave everything they had so that the next generation could succeed. And your presence here tonight shows that America is a place where if you work hard, no matter what you look like, what your last name is, how many vowels you have in your name, you can make it if you try. And even if we are not Italian American, or Mets fans, we can celebrate that Mike Piazza is finally in the Baseball Hall of Fame. [Laughter]
I also want to take this occasion to once again thank my great friend Matteo. He may be the youngest Prime Minister in modern Italian history—he makes me feel old, which is unfortunate. [Laughter] When I came in I was the young guy; now he's the young guy. [Laughter] But from the first time we met, I could see that he represented the energy and the optimism, the vision and the values that can carry Italy, and Europe, forward. He is, as you say in Italy, buono come il pane.
Matteo, I cannot thank you enough for your excellent partnership as we've worked to advance the security and prosperity of our citizens and the dignity of people around the world. I understand that when you were growing up, your mother would tell you stories about Robert Kennedy's commitment to justice and that she would end by telling you, ""Matteo, fight."" As you fight for the cause of reform, know that we stand with you. I believe that Italy, and the world, will continue to benefit from your leadership for many years to come.
Now, one of the reasons that I'm so confident that Matteo will continue to make outstanding contributions is because he has an outstanding partner in Agnese. Our wives keep us humble. As our Italian friends know, Matteo's first claim to fame—when he was just 19 years old—was, he was on Italy's version of ""Wheel of Fortune."" [Laughter] This is a true story. And Agnese points out that several of the sweaters and the suits that he wore were too big—which is an affront to Italian fashion. [Laughter] Matteo may deny it, but there's video, and you can judge for yourself. [Laughter] Giorgio Armani is here, and he would be ashamed to know that the Italian Prime Minister used to wear things like this. [Laughter]
Now, you are not alone, because when Michelle was in Milan for last year's Expo, she spoke with some young people about the importance of eating slowly and savoring your food—unlike President Obama, who she said, sometimes ""shovels"" his food down—[laughter]—which is true. [Laughter] So the point is that Matteo and I both married up. And because of our wives, we eat better, we dress better, we are better. And we thank you both.
In closing, I just want to reminisce about my last visit to Rome. Thanks to Matteo's Minister—Ministry of Culture, I had the opportunity to visit the Coliseum. And one of the perks of being President is, you can go to the Coliseum and nobody else is there. It was late in the day. It was quiet. The Sun was going down. And as I walked across those ancient stones, worn by the history of 2,000 years, it was a humbling reminder of our place here on Earth.
In the grand sweep of time, each of us is here only for a brief moment. So many of the things that we focus on each day—the political ups and downs, the successes and the setbacks—those things are fleeting. What matters in the end is what we build. What matters is what we leave behind, the things that will endure long after we are gone. As the poet Virgil reminded us, ""Fortune favors the bold.""
And so I want to propose a toast: To the enduring alliance between the United States and Italy; to our friends, Matteo and Agnese; and to the friendship between the Americans and the Italians. In pursuit of the world we can build for future generations, may we always be bold; may fortune smile upon us. Salute. Cheers.
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
And with that, let me bring to the stage the Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi.
Prime Minister Renzi. Mr. President, Madam First Lady, dear American friends, cari amici italiani: It is an incredible honor. It's an incredible privilege to be here with you on this occasion of the last state dinner of President Obama. I am really excited and really great because I think this is a special moment for the history of this country, as the Presidency of President Obama was a special moment in the life of this great country.
So thank you so much. Thank you. It's an honor for Italy, dear Barack, but it's also an honor for us. So thank you all, from Agnese and myself, for your warm welcome.
But I'm really in a difficult situation, because it's impossible for me to reply after the President Obama, and also this afternoon I spent time to imagine an organization of something to give thanks. And it's impossible. I think, for Mr. President, that we can organize after the finish of your service a dinner in Florence, after the little walk in Uffizi's Gallery and in front of David, and we can prepare Sasha and Malia to verify if really ice cream—Italian ice cream—is better on the water, and then not a state dinner, but we with the osteria, with the Florentine wine and Tuscan wine we can taste. And we can verify if the tomatoes of the garden of White House are better than tomatoes of Italian products.[Laughter] We can try that.
I know, Michelle, your tomatoes are great. But after the last week's, let me be very frank: Your speeches are better than your tomatoes. [Laughter] And thank you so much. Thank you so much as Prime Minister, but thank you so much also as father of a young daughter.
And, Barack, you know I'm a huge fan of you. You know I follow from the first speech in—first, not first—first speech for the Presidential run in February 2007 in Illinois. But when I listened to the speech of Michelle in Philadelphia, I think finally, finally, maybe when I see—""when they go low, we go high,"" I told you, finally, I found someone of the same level of Barack Obama: Michelle Obama. [Laughter] So this is good.
Just—but let me conclude with a personal consideration. I come from a city called Florence, so I really—I love lots the history of my country. And during the Renaissance in Florence, masters and students used to work together to produce masterpieces and also not masterpieces, but the goal is masterpiece—masterpieces they have endured across centuries. And those workshops—this workshop was called bottega. Bottega was the place in which masters and students together tried to do better, tried to build a future. New generation acquired inside the bottega a comprehensive vision of the future. And I think, Mr. President, dear Barack, this is what you have done for us in this period.
Eight years, very important for international community, not only for the United States of America. And I think your service was a service as a master of Renaissance, because you work with us to give us an opportunity and we worked together exactly with the spirit of bottega: try to make better, try to give a special opportunity to new generations.
So, as a Florentine, I think I'm really grateful to you for your service and also for your message of the ideal state of government because with your message, a lot of new leaders around the world today could imagine the future as a good place in which imagine our destination and our generation.
Thank you so much for that, Mr. President. Thank you so much, master of Renaissance.
So, in Italy, there is an expression, is an expression who come from the shared table, a shared moment of a—particular moment in the dinner and lunch—is an expression who come from Latin: cum and panis. Cum from Latin is ""with""; panis is ""bread."" Cum panis comes a lot of things; the expression ""company"" comes exactly from that. Why? Because the values in the table are exactly the values of sharing not only bread, not only wine, not only food, but sharing a friendship and common values. I think this is the real relation between the United States of America and Italy. We share the same values, the same friendship. And yes, in the table, cum piú panis, we share the bread. We share the food. We share also the wine. But we share above all the future and the common values. For all the reasons, I propose a toast: To President Obama, to First Lady Michelle, thank you so much for your incredible journey. Thank you so much for your incredible service. Thank you so much for the values you inspire not only in the United States of America, but around the world. Thank you, President.
[Prime Minister Renzi offered a toast.]
Thank you, President. Salute.

state-dinners,Gerald R. Ford,"December 06, 1975","
President Marcos, Mrs. Marcos, distinguished guests, honored friends:
I come to the Philippines at the end of a strenuous but very exciting journey. Two nations once regarded as distant but with the modern means of transportation are now our neighbors in a new and interdependent world.
On the way home, I have stopped here to visit America's old and very dearest friend and to be exposed to the very gracious and the world-renowned Philippine hospitality which is not exceeded in any place in the world.
Throughout this trip, we have been most graciously welcomed and warmly received, but the experience this afternoon, Mr. President, driving from the airport to the palace was an exhilarating, unbelievable experience. To see the many, many traditions, the songs, the gowns, the actions of all of your people was a great experience. It showed a great diversity in your society, but it reminded me of something I learned in Sunday school a good many years ago.
My then Sunday school teacher told me that the beauty of Joseph's coat was its many colors. So, I say to you in the Philippines, the strength of your nation is its diversity which has been woven into a strength that will forever be a pillar for your great country.
Mr. President, throughout this trip I have observed an international sense of community, a shared commitment to peace and a better life for all peoples. I found a common determination to have the leaders of the world, the leaders of the nations to chart their own courses, to shape their own character. And I saw a growing awareness that this determination of individuals and of nations to be independent and self-reliant is a constructive force in the world in which we live today.
It encourages the sense of respect for one's self and for others. And that is the basis of a real community of nations in the world in which we live.
Today in the Philippines I find something far more. Our two nations have a most unique history of shared experiences and similarity of outlook. We have both known the pain of war.
President Marcos and myself are only two out of many, many thousands in both nations who fought together in earlier years, one in the forests and fields of Luzon and the other on the waters of the Philippine Sea.
As individuals and as nations, however, we have both tasted the bitterness of defeat, the satisfaction of joint devotion to a common goal, and the lesson that victory once achieved is only the beginning of a new challenge.
We have already observed the common determination of people throughout Asia and the rest of the world to achieve a more satisfying life. That determination is shared by you in the Philippines and by us in the United States.
We have learned as nations to recognize that we need not all be identical to survive. We have learned that we need only to treat one another, different or similar as we may be, in a spirit of generosity and mutual benefit and respect.
This spirit which our nations share is the essence of real hospitality. It is one of the very special elements that strengthens our sense of common interests in each other's security and well-being.
In that spirit, Mr. President, let me offer a toast to you, to Mrs. Marcos, to the people of the Philippines, and to the mutual respect and sense of community that unite us as two great republics.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"February 11, 2014","
President Obama. Good evening, everybody. Bonsoir. Please, have a seat. I have now officially exhausted my French. [Laughter] Michelle and I are so honored to welcome you to the White House as we host President Hollande and his delegation for this historic state visit between our nations, the first in nearly 20 years.
I think we have a translation. Is that correct? No? You don't want me to translate. [Laughter] Apparently not.
At our press conference today, I quoted Alexis de Tocqueville, that son of France who in 1831 set out across our young country and chronicled our American democracy. And those who have—are familiar with de Tocqueville are always amazed by how well he understood this nation of ours and captured its spirit as well as anybody ever has. And tonight I'd like to share some of his lesser known observations.
About American dining, de Tocqueville wrote, ""The absence of wine at our meals at first struck us as very disagreeable; and we still can't understand the multitude of things that [Americans] succeed in introducing into their stomachs."" [Laughter] So some things do not change. When François came here years ago as a student to study our fast food, I suspect he said the same thing.
About the White House, de Tocqueville's traveling companion wrote, ""The President of the United States occupies a palace that in Paris would be called a fine private residence."" [Laughter] And he wrote—and I very much can relate to this—""The power of the King of France would be nil if it were modeled after the power of the President."" [Laughter] And the King did not have to deal with the filibuster. [Laughter]
Now, Americans took lessons from France as well. One young American lawyer went to Paris and was deeply moved to see White and Black students studying together. And that young American was Charles Sumner, who—inspired by what he saw in France—became one of our greatest abolitionists, helped to end slavery, and is one of the reasons that all of us can be here this evening as full citizens, free and equal.
Now, it is true that we Americans have grown to love all things French: the films, the food, the wine. Especially the wine. [Laughter] But most of all, we love our French friends because we've stood together for our freedom for more than 200 years. Tonight I again want to pay tribute to President Hollande for the principled leadership and personal friendship and courage that he has shown on the world stage. Thank you, François.
We started this visit yesterday at Monticello. And I'd like to end where we began. Thomas Jefferson wrote: ""So ask the traveled inhabitant of any nation, in what country on Earth would you rather live? Certainly, in my own, where [are] my friends, my relations, and the earliest and sweetest affections and recollections of my life."" But Jefferson added, ""Which would be your second choice? France."" Of course.
And so I propose a toast: To our friend and partner President Hollande, to all of our friends from France who are here today, vive la France, God bless America, and long live the alliance between our great nations. À votre santé! Cheers.
[At this point, a toast was offered.]
President Obama. Please, François. Cheers!
[President Hollande spoke in English as follows.]
President Hollande. Mr. President, dear Michelle, Members of the Congress and French Parliament, ladies and gentlemen: I hope that translation exists. [Laughter]
Mr. President, I would like to thank you for the warm welcome that you have extended to me and my delegation. France and the United States of America are bound by ties of history: great history of French citizens such as Lafayette, who fought alongside the heroes of independence to allow your dream of freedom to prevail; the glorious history of the Americans who came to fight on French soil during the First World War and, then in June 1944, to liberate the European continent from Nazi oppression.
This afternoon it was a great moment and a great honor to award your Unknown Soldier with the insignia of the French Legion of Honor and to award medal to six glorious veterans of the Second World War. I promise we shall never forget them.
More recently, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack, France shared Americans' pain. On that frightful day, someone has warned, we were all Americans. This is the very reason why we endured together in Afghanistan.
Monsieur le Président, now I will speak French.
[President Hollande spoke in French, and then concluded his remarks in English and French as follows.]
President Hollande. I raise my glass in honor of the United States of America, of the President Barack Obama, Michelle: Long live the United States! Vive la France et vive l'amitié entre la France et les États-Unis.
[A toast was offered. President Hollande's preceding remarks were then translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Hollande. Our two countries share universal values, and we have feelings for one another. We love Americans, although we don't always say so. And you love the French, but you're sometimes too shy to say so. [Laughter] Too withdrawn. But we share the same universal values: freedom, democracy, respect for the law. These principles guide our action.
Ever since I took office at the Presidency, we have been defending them together. In Mali, the French Armed Forces were able to rely on the efficient support awarded by the U.S. soldiers and equipment. In the Central African Republic, your support has accompanied our operation aiming at restoring security in this country, torn by its actions and violence between religions.
Together, we have removed the unacceptable threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon, and we have succeeded in reaching an interim agreement. In Syria, we together removed—through resorting to the threat of force—the threat of a worsening situation, and we managed to force the regime of Bashar al-Asad to accept the destruction of his stockpiles of chemical weapons. And again, together, we are looking resolutely together for a political outcome so desperately needed.
Together, the French and the Americans also want to work for growth and to introduce new rules that will prevent financial crises and enable us to fight more efficiently against tax evasion. First results are here, and the strength and robustness of the American economy is a source of hope for all developed countries. Provided that we open up our markets and intensify our trade, we will succeed.
Together, we will also rise to the challenge of climate change. Paris will be hosting the climate change conference in 2015. It is up to us to convince our major partners to take the necessary steps before it is too late. And I know again that I can count on your commitment.
Mr. President, the relations between our two countries have reached an exceptional level of closeness and confidence, and there is one simple reason for that: We share the same vision of the world, and we show mutual respect. The United States of America and France are two great nations. What is expected of them is to keep a promise, a promise of freedom and the promise of progress, and also to keep a dream alive—that same dream made by Jefferson, Washington, Lafayette, and the French revolutionaries—a dream to change the world. By uniting our forces, by united—uniting our talents, we will be able to keep the flame of hope alive.
I raise my glass to the President of the United States of America and to Michelle Obama. Long live the United States! Long live France!

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 21, 1981","
The President. Chancellor Schmidt, Mrs. Schmidt:
It's a genuine pleasure to welcome you and your guests to the White House this evening.
Mr. Chancellor, your visit today has been a most welcome and productive one. We've discussed significant issues that affect us-our NATO and security commitments, our economy and foreign policy, our desire for greater stability in the world. I must tell everyone here tonight, though, that one important matter was left off our agenda. I had hoped that we could resolve once and for all the relative advantages of Rhine wines versus California wines. [Laughter]
Earlier today I spoke of America's debt to German immigrants who settled here. Many of their names are easily recognizable: a piano craftsman, Heinrich Steinway; a space scientist, Werner von Braun; Levi Strauss, who created bluejeans— [laughter] —and a brewer, Adolphus Busch. But one of our most notable German Americans is the caricaturist Thomas Nast, who made some very special contributions. He gave us our images of Santa Claus, the Republican elephant, the Democratic donkey, and he even created the character of Uncle Sam, the personification of America all around the world.
Now, these symbols have been important to Americans and their self-image. Today I hope we've dealt in both symbol and substance. The arrival ceremony and this state dinner are symbols of a respect and a friendship for the Federal Republic of Germany and its Chancellor. Our discussions, on the other hand, dealt with the substance of our economy and our defense partnership. From these talks, we have a better understanding of our common goals and aspirations.
Mr. Chancellor, the American people have a high regard for the vitality and the future of the Federal Republic. We agree with the German poet Heinrich Heine, who wrote, ""Germany will ever stand. It is a hale and hearty land.""
And so, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me in a toast to Chancellor and Mrs. Schmidt, to their hale and hearty land, and to our continued hale and hearty friendship.
The Chancellor. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
The kind words you have just spoken, Mr. President, for which I'm most grateful, underscore the warm hospitality that you have extended to us here in Washington.
My wife and I and the members of my delegation are being touched by this manifestation of the close bonds of friendship between our two countries. And we even are thankful that you saved us from a contest between Californian and Rhine wine. I mentioned to the neighbors at my table that we had jellybeans instead, and they were not so bad. [Laughter]
Let me frankly say that in a way, I regard this evening as a kind of homecoming after having been in your great country so many times, after working with political leaders of both sides of the aisle in America, so many long years, and with four American Presidents, and seeing, of course, so many old friends as your guests tonight, Mr. President. We deem it a great pleasure to be able to end this day, a day of important political discussion here in the White House, as you and Mrs. Reagan's guests.
My wife and I wish you both success and happiness in the years ahead, and I say this with specific emphasis, because we are still feeling the shock of the attempt made on your life, in which you were seriously wounded. We all are grateful and relieved to see that you have recovered so quickly, and I cannot tell you how much I was relieved this morning in getting out of the car and seeing you there, standing upright, and smiling a little and seeming strong and vigorous. We felt deeply sorry about that attempt, and we deeply admired your courage, you circumspection, your unbroken energy. And I'm also glad that the other members of your staff who were wounded are well again or are recovering. And if some of your staff would care, please give them our regards, transmitted to them.
Mr. President, under your leadership the United States is now embarking on a steady course of confidence and self-assuredness. You have set about the task of resolving your country's economic problems with new ideas, exceptional vigor. And I followed with interest how you have applied yourself with great energy, personal commitment to your program for America's economic renewal. And the interest of us Europeans, of us Germans, in your economic renewal is, of course, only too understandable, because the economic well-being of the United States is of direct importance for us in Europe and for us in Germany. It is also for this reason that we hope that your administration will soon meet with success in its efforts to overcome the economic difficulties.
The United States and the Federal Republic are allies whose close cooperation has proved its value in difficult times over more than a quarter of a century now, and I guess it will continue to stand the test in an international environment that is becoming increasingly difficult and also increasingly dangerous. In view of the instability around the world, the partnership between Western Europe and North America, I think, is the prime factor of stability. That partnership remains a constant feature of our policy. It is at no one's disposal. Our American friends can rely on us just as we do rely on the United States.
And we, in particular, welcome the self-confidence, the self-assuredness, of the American Nation under your leadership, Mr. President. We Europeans know that it is crucial for the United States to live up to its responsibilities as a world power allied with Western Europe. We believe that Europe and America have a common destiny. America's political and military presence in Europe is not only an indispensable condition for the security of West Europeans, it's also an essential element of global security, and German-American friendship is one cornerstone of that Euro-American partnership.
The present generation on both sides of the Atlantic know this from past experience. Meanwhile, a new generation is in the process of assuming the responsibility for the destiny of our countries. It is, I feel, one of the foremost tasks of our generation to make sure that the next generation will appreciate the decisive role of this close and trustful partnership—better still that they themselves experience it. Only then will they be in a position to cherish, defend, and further develop this precious legacy.
The talks and meetings I've had today have proved that we continue with fresh confidence the successful cooperation for the benefit of our peoples and for the preservation of peace. It is on this note, ladies and gentlemen, that I would like to ask you to drink with me to the health of the President of the United States of America and Mrs. Reagan, and to the well-being of the great American Nation.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"October 08, 1985","
The President. Prime Minister Lee and Mrs. Lee, honored guests who are here tonight, Nancy and I welcome you to the White House.
It was a great pleasure for me today to renew a valued friendship with Prime Minister Lee. I first met the Prime Minister on a trip that I took on behest of President Nixon. And when we stopped in Singapore, I was amazed at the dynamic society that I found there. How could a country with such a small area and few resources be making such strides? And then I met Prime Minister Lee, and my questions were answered. He is a man of principle and vision. His leadership has provided the vigorous and creative people of Singapore the means to move ahead, to achieve, and to build.
Singapore's experience has been in stark contrast to developing countries where political power has been derived from terror and brute force. Instead, Prime Minister Lee's authority has rested on his capacity to mold the opinion of his countrymen and build consensus. He has used his position to free the talents and energy of his people so they could be channeled into constructive, society-building activity. Fortunately, Prime Minister Lee's sound judgment does not stop at the water's edge. American leaders, including this one, have frequently benefited from his wise counsel. Our meetings today were no less beneficial. Our exchange was cordial, reflecting a mutuality of interests and a harmony of views.
Mr. Prime Minister, I want to express my personal admiration for your recognition of the contributions America makes to world peace. As the world's most powerful democracy, our people carry a heavy military and diplomatic burden and often thankless task. But you have demonstrated an appreciation and understanding that makes it all worthwhile. This spirit of mutual respect was evidenced in our meetings today. None of this should be reason for surprise. Our two peoples may, at first glance, seem worlds apart, both in geographic location and culture; but a closer look reveals that Singapore and the United States are nations made up of hardworking immigrants and their descendants, who came to a new homeland to improve their lot and build a decent life for their families. We're both democratic nations committed to peace and to the preservation of human liberty. And these bonds are being bolstered by continued cultural and educational exchanges and, of course, the many commercial ties between our peoples.
Mr. Prime Minister, we're aware that your people are now faced with severe challenges brought on by international economic conditions. The United States faced economic adversity not long ago; tough decisions had to be made. It's heartening to see that you're moving forward, Mr. Prime Minister, with an eye toward the long-run well-being of your people. I understand full well this is not always easy to do, but I want you and your citizens to know that the people of the United States want you to succeed and prosper. Our meetings today confirmed again the people of Singapore, as we say here, are our kind of people.
So, would you all join me in toasting the people of Singapore and the distinguished leader, Prime Minister Lee, and Mrs. Lee.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, my wife and I are much honored and delighted to be here with you, enjoying your warm hospitality. We would like to express our special thanks to Mrs. Reagan, for we learned of her personal interest in the preparations for this splendid occasion. It is a rare and gracious First Lady who would personally settle and approve the menu, the wines, the floral arrangements, and the entertainment.
I read of Mrs. Reagan and her campaign against drug abuse. Her personal efforts and her attention to the details of the cause that she has championed has won her wide acclaim. I watched her on television, standing amidst the rubble of Mexico City a few days after the earthquake, bringing succor and comfort to the victims. After nearly 5 years in the White House, I notice the latest opinion poll puts her approval rating at 71 percent— [laughter] —ahead of the President's— [laughter] —and by 9 percent. [Laughter] Mr. President, your staff has to shape up— [laughter] —or you may have to borrow the First Lady's staff. [Laughter]
Mr. President, I have been a regular visitor of the United States for about two decades. It was an ordeal to watch America writhe in the self-inflicted agony at home during the years she tried to fight a war in Vietnam. And even after the war, she did not bounce back from her depression. And morale dropped to a new low when American hostages were held in Tehran. When you were taking your oath of office as President, the hostages were released. It was proof to me that the Iranian mullahs were not as crazy as the media had made them out to be. [Laughter]
You made your fellow Americans and your friends feel proud and optimistic by the confidence you radiated. You have never allowed any problem, however daunting, to weigh you down. Now, as imports surge into America because of an over-strong dollar, Congress, in its pessimism, moves towards protectionism. You have not yielded to such despair. You will astound your critics yet again when you turn the spell of apparent adversity to advantage by opening up foreign markets and creating new jobs for Americans. The Reagan years will surely be a noticeable landmark in American history, for you have restored American leadership in the maintenance of a just and equitable world order.
Mr. President, I have been privileged to share some of your thoughts today. The friendly relations between the United States and Singapore are at their best, indeed, as they should be. I have been a privileged guest in these surroundings under different Presidents, as I explained to the young lady so judiciously selected to be my companion tonight. [Laughter] I have never felt more relaxed and more at home, and I think I owe that to the other attractive young lady on my left. I have been here and have been impressed. Tonight, I have been here and have enjoyed myself. [Laughter]
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, may I now ask you to join me in a toast to the President and the First Lady to wish them good health and happiness.

Prime Minister and Mrs. Chretien, Ambassador and Mrs. Chretien, distinguished Canadian guests and my fellow Americans: It has been a real honor for me to welcome the Prime Minister and Mrs. Chretien to Washington and to do our best to return the warm hospitality that Hillary and I received in Ottawa 2 years ago.
The whole state visit has gone exactly as planned, except we didn't get to play golf. [Laughter] Now, the last time the Prime Minister and I played, we played exactly to a tie. The press corps had a field day trying to figure out how long it took the Ambassadors to negotiate that result. [Laughter] But we wanted to give some truly symbolic, ego-overriding manifestation of the equal partnership between the United States and Canada.
From the start of his career in public life— and for those of you who were not here earlier, Jean Chretien was elected to Parliament at the age of 29, exactly 34 years ago today. Throughout those years, he has brought passion and compassion to every endeavor. He has held almost every post in the Canadian Government at one time or another. As I said in Ottawa when I first read his resume, I wondered why he couldn't hold a job. [Laughter] Now as Prime Minister, he seems to be doing impressively well at that, leading his nation's remarkable economic success: his deficit down to balance this year, the lowest interest rates in four decades, growth rates near the top of those of the industrialized nations.
Under his leadership, relations between our two nations are stronger and better than ever. Of course, close neighbors sometimes disagree. Family members sometimes disagree. But united by democratic values and our long border and rich friendship, we've always found a way to work through those disagreements with patience and mutual respect, even back in the War of 1812 when, as Ambassador Chretien admitted tonight when I showed him the burn marks that are still on the White House from that war, our people were officially on opposite sides. Nonetheless, the residents of St. Stephen, New Brunswick, actually lent gunpowder to their neighbors across the river in Calais, Maine, so they could celebrate the Fourth of July.
Our relationship works. We measure its merit in the difference it makes in the daily lives of Americans and Canadians. Today we've worked to strengthen our law enforcement cooperation to protect our most vulnerable citizens. We've taken new action to protect our environment and the environment especially of the Great Lakes our two nations are blessed to share.
We've made it even simpler to cross the borders so neighbors can visit each other with greater ease and traffic jams become a thing of the past. We've set our sights on new horizons in space. I thank the people of Canada for providing the special purpose dexterous manipulator, otherwise known as the Canada Hand—[laughter]—for the international space station. This 11-foot machine is so precise, it can pick up an egg without breaking it. And now, Mr. Prime Minister, if you could supply us sometime in the very near future a ""Canada knee,"" I for one would be very grateful. [Laughter]
The Canada Hand is practical, sophisticated, smart, and strong. Therefore, it is a fitting symbol of the helping hand the people of Canada have always extended to the world. From the days you helped runaway slaves to freedom to the battles we've fought together in Europe, Korea, and the Persian Gulf in this century, to the hope your sons and daughters represent to the people of Bosnia and Haiti, Canada stands for the best of humanity. And every day, Canada leads by example.
Prime Minister and Mrs. Chretien, we are proud to honor the great and good partnership between our nations. And let me also say on a personal note, I thank you for your friendship to Hillary and me, and we applaud your own remarkable partnership as you celebrate your 40th wedding anniversary this year.
To you both, to your nation, to the people of Canada, long live our mutual friendship. Vive la Canada. I ask you to join me in a toast to the Prime Minister and Mrs. Chretien.
[At this point, the President offered a toast.]
Mr. Prime Minister.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"January 19, 2011","
President Obama. Good evening, everybody. Please have a seat. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. And thank you for joining us as we host President Hu and the Chinese delegation and as we pay tribute to the bonds between two great nations and two proud peoples.
There are too many distinguished guests to mention all of you tonight. But I do want to acknowledge a few who have championed relations between our nations: First of all, President Jimmy Carter and his wonderful wife Rosalynn Carter are here, as well as President Bill Clinton and my outstanding Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
President Hu, we have met today in a spirit of mutual respect: the United States, the oldest democracy in the world, and China, one of the oldest civilizations in the world. And while it's easy to focus on our differences of culture and perspective, let us never forget the values that our people share: a reverence for family; the belief that, with education and hard work and with sacrifice, the future is what we make it; and most of all, the desire to give our children a better life.
Let's also never forget that throughout our history, our people have worked together for mutual progress. We've traded together for more than 200 years. We stood together in the Second World War. Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans have helped to build America, including many who join us here tonight.
The Chinese and American people work together and create new opportunities together every single day. Mr. President, and today we've shown that our governments can work together as well, for our mutual benefit. And that includes this bit of news: Under a new agreement, our National Zoo will continue to dazzle children and visitors with the beloved giant pandas.
I'm told that there is a Chinese proverb that says: ""If you want 1 year of prosperity, then grow grain. If you want 10 years of prosperity, then grow trees. But if you want 100 years of prosperity, then you grow people.""
And so I propose a toast.
To our people, the citizens of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America: May they grow together in friendship, may they prosper together in peace, and may they realize their dream of the future for themselves, for their children, and for their grandchildren.
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
President Obama. Cheers. Ganbei.
President Hu. President Obama and Mrs. Obama, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: Good evening. I am delighted to once again come to the United States and pay a state visit at the invitation of President Obama.
Since setting foot on this beautiful land, we have received the gracious hospitality of the U.S. Government and people. This evening President Obama is hosting this welcoming dinner for us and has just made warm remarks. On behalf of my colleagues and in my own name, I want to express heartfelt thanks to President and Mrs. Obama and other American friends present today.
I also wish to convey through you the best wishes of the Chinese people to the friendly American people and extend cordial greetings to people from various sectors of the United States who have given care and support to the growth of China-U.S. relations.
The purpose of my visit is to increase mutual trust, enhance friendship, deepen cooperation, and advance the positive, cooperative, and comprehensive China-U.S. relationship for the 21st century.
In recent years, particularly over the past 2 years since President Obama took office, China-U.S. relations have made strong headway, thanks to the joint efforts of both sides.
We have increased exchanges in cooperation in a wide range of areas, maintained close communication and coordination on major international and regional issues, and played a positive role in promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world.
Under the current circumstances, our two countries share broader common interests, shoulder bigger common responsibilities, and face more severe common challenges than at any time in history. As a result, it is more important than never for us to maintain the long-term, sound, and steady growth of our bilateral relations. This is the reality we face, and it should be recognized by both sides.
This morning President Obama and I had an in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and international and regional issues of common interest. And we reached important agreement. We agreed that our two countries should increase contacts at the top and other levels, strengthen strategic mutual trust through dialogue and communication, intensify exchanges and cooperation in all fields, and step up communication and coordination on international and regional issues.
We agreed that the two countries should respect each other's sovereignty, territorial integrity and the development interests, properly handle differences and frictions, and work together to build a China-U.S. cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit.
China-U.S. relations have traveled a extraordinary journey in the past 32 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties. A review of the history of our relations shows that we have far more common interests than differences, and cooperation for mutual benefit has always being the mainstream of our relations. This has reinforced our confidence in further pushing forward our relationship.
Today, both China and the United States are confronted with the arduous task of sustaining steady economic growth and achieving economic transformation. And we both need to tackle the various challenges brought by economic globalization. This has added to our need and desire to enhance cooperation.
We should pursue our relations with a stronger conviction, a broader vision, and more proactive approach. We need to take solid steps and make pioneering efforts to fully tap the potential of cooperation and strive for new progress in China-U.S. relations.
I am confident that with joint efforts, China-U.S. cooperative partnership will yield bountiful fruits for the greater benefit of our people and make new and bigger contribution to the noble cause of world peace and development.
[President Hu offered a toast.]
President Hu. To the health of President and Mrs. Obama, to the health of all friends present here, to the stronger friendship between the people of China and the United States, and to the steady growth of China-U.S. relations.
Cheers.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"December 31, 1977","
THE SHAH. Mr. President, Mrs. Carter, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
It gives the Shabanou and myself great pleasure to welcome you to our country. This reception is particularly auspicious since it takes place on the eve of 1978, and your presence here represents a New Year's gift for your Iranian friends.
In our country, according to ancient tradition, the visit of the first guest in the new year is an omen for that year. And although the annual new year is celebrated with the advent of spring, nevertheless, since the distinguished guest tonight is such a person of good will and achievement, naturally we consider it as a most excellent omen.
Mr. President, you now have come to a country which has always had unshakable links with your country and your great nation. We are united together by a special relationship made all the closer by a wide community of mutual interests, which we share in our firm determination to contribute to the maintenance of world peace and security in assuring human progress and betterment.
History has been witness to the growth and development of an outstanding relationship Between two nations motivated by common trust, good will, and respect which has repeatedly withstood the test of time.
Humanitarianism, liberty, good will, constructiveness, and creativeness, which are the distinctive qualities of the great American nation, have always been highly regarded by us. Fortunately, our American friends have also perceived this friendship and regard of our people from the very beginning.
The Reverend Mr. Smith, the first American that set foot on the land of Iran in the year 1832, wrote in his assignment report that living among good people like Iranians and serving them was more' pleasant for him than anything else, and that he considered the best days of his life those spent in this country.
It gives me pleasure to state that the fruitful cooperation, the social and cultural fields between our two nations have commenced even prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations.
The first modern school was established in Iran in the year 1836 by American missionaries. The American College in Tehran, which was established 100 years ago, was an outstanding center for the education and training of Iranian youth during the whole course of its activities. Our people carry such good memories of its beloved principal, Dr. Samuel Jordan, that one of the highways of Tehran has been named after him.
Now that we are reminiscing on our meritorious American friends, it is perhaps suitable to cherish the memory of Howard Baskerville, a young American who, upon completion of his studies at Princeton, was assigned as a teacher in the Memorial School at Tabriz and, during the constitutional revolution of Iran, heroically and bravely lost his life in the fight for freedom.
This feeling towards Iran has always been evidenced in the literary works of your nation. For instance, the poetry of Ralph Waldo Emerson, in glorifying Iran, is .one of the most beautiful examples of its kind in the world of literature. The basic and comprehensive work of Arthur Upham Pope regarding the art of Iran is the best research work that has ever been prepared in this field. Likewise, the extensive studies of William Jackson regarding the culture and civilization of Iran are among the most valuable researches in the history of Iranology.
Numerous universities in the United States have expanded activities in the fields of Iranian studies and its language. Also valuable treasures of the culture and art of Iran are preserved in various libraries and museums of your country. Moreover, American archeologists have played an eminent role in archeological discoveries in Iran.
In the political field, our nation carries unforgettable memories of the role of America in our crisis and times of stress, from the beginning of the present century. For instance, we will never forget that in the great political and economic adversity of our country, in the second decade of this century, William Morgan Shuster, upon the invitation of the government of Iran, sincerely endeavored to bring order into the finances of Iran. Moreover, when, following the 1919 agreement, Iran was in danger of losing its independence, America ,raised its voice to the world in support of the sovereignty of Iran, as also in the years after the Second World War, America provided us with vital economic and political assistance.
During World War II, I personally had the pleasure of meeting President Franklin Roosevelt in our capital city. Since then I had the opportunity of welcoming in Iran several Presidents of the United States. And I personally have also traveled repeatedly to your great country. I am glad to state that all these visits have been accompanied with the spirit of friendship and cooperation, which is the distinct quality of our relationship.
An example of this cooperation is the long-term economic exchange agreement between Iran and the United States, which was recently signed and, in its scope, is the largest agreement ever signed between us and any other country.
Almost 100 years ago the first American Ambassador, Samuel G. W. Benjamin, who had been assigned by President Chester Alan Arthur, came to Iran. In his book, ""Persia and the Persians,"" he wrote, ""Iran today is a weak and unknown country, but certainly this country will step into the path of progress and in the not too distant future will again play an important role in the world.""
Now with this prediction coming true, our country has started its role within its potentialities and possibilities. Perhaps it need not be mentioned, but this is a positive and constructive role and in conformity with the principles that your great country has always supported independent and of which you, Mr. President, are the most notable advocate.
From the early days of your election campaign you indicated how much you will attach to high ideals of right and justice, moral beliefs in human values. These are all qualities that have elevated the American society in such a short period of time to its present high prestige in the world, and a nation like ours with its ancient culture can very well feel to what extent such concepts in moral principles are vital, especially in the world of today, which is suffering from some sort of a civilization crisis.
I entertain excellent memories of the fruitful discussions which I had with you in Washington a few weeks ago. The cordial hospitality extended by Mrs. Carter and yourself and the warmth of your attitude and the understanding which you showed in our discussions have deeply touched me. I am glad that our discussions were so meaningful, particularly in the case of energy, which is one of the most important and vital problems of our era.
We, who are among the greatest producers, share the same view that the present unrestricted use of oil--which is an expendable and finite resource--is not logical and that this valuable commodity, instead of the present, normal daily use, should be utilized mainly in the petrochemical industry. In the meantime, efforts should be exerted to find a substitute in new resources of energy.
Fortunately, we enjoy close cooperation with your country in the field of energy, which will no doubt be consolidated in the future. We also share the same opinions regarding the establishment of an honorable and durable peace, and we sincerely hope that 1978, which begins tomorrow, will be a year of such a peace of which you are the harbinger.
I wish every success to you,Mr. President, and Mrs. Carter, who has proved to be such a successful ambassador of good will, motivated, as she is, by high humanitarian ideals in your present tour, and hope that this will prove to be fruitful trips in the interest of the whole world and that of peace, security, and welfare for human society.
With this hope I propose a toast, Mr. President, for your and Mrs. Carter's health and happiness, for the further progress and prosperity of the great and noble American people, for the ever increasing friendship and cooperation between our two countries, and for international peace and understanding.
THE PRESIDENT. Your Majesties and distinguished leaders of Iran from all walks of life:
I would like to say just a few words tonight in appreciation for your hospitality and the delightful evening that we've already experienced with you. Some have asked why we came to Iran so close behind the delightful visit that we received from the Shah and Empress Farah just a month or so ago. After they left our country, I asked my wife, ""With whom would you like to spend New Year's Eve?"" And she said, ""Above all others, I think, with the Shah and Empress Farah."" So we arranged the trip accordingly and came to be with you.
These visits and the close cooperation that we share, the intense personal and group negotiations and consultations are very beneficial to both our countries. They are particularly beneficial to me as a new leader of the United States. I might pause parenthetically and say I apologize for taking 10 years off your service this afternoon when I said 27 years. It should have been 37 years. And Empress Farah, thank you very much for correcting me on that. The Shah said he felt 10 years younger when I did that. [Laughter]
But we do have a close friendship that's very meaningful to all the people in our country. I think it is a good harbinger of things to come--that we could close out this year and begin a new year with those in whom we have such great confidence and with whom we share such great responsibilities for the present and for the future.
As we drove in from the airport this afternoon to the beautiful white palace where we will spend the night, and saw the monument in the distance, I asked the Shah what was the purpose of the beautiful monument. And he told me that it was built several years ago, erected to commemorate the 2500th anniversary of this great nation. This was a sobering thought to me. We have been very proud in our Nation to celebrate our 200th birthday, a couple of years ago. But it illustrates the deep and penetrating consciousness that comes from an ancient heritage and a culture that preceded any that we've ever known in our own lives.
Recently, Empress Farah gave us a beautiful book called ""The Bridge of Turquoise""--and we get many gifts of that kind from visitors--and for a few days I have to admit that we didn't pay enough attention to it. And one night I started to thumb through the pages, and I called my wife, Rosalynn, and I called my daughter, Amy, who climbed into my lap, and we spent several hours studying very carefully the beautiful history that this book portrays of Persia, of Iran, of its people, of its lands, of its heritage and its history, and also of its future. It caused me to be reminded again of the value of ancient friendships and the importance of close ties that bind us as we face difficult problems.
Iran, because of the great leadership of the Shah, is an island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world.
This is a great tribute to you, Your Majesty, and to your leadership and to the respect and the admiration and love which your people give to you.
The transformation that has taken place in this nation is indeed remarkable under your leadership. And as we sat together this afternoon, discussing privately for a few moments what might be done to bring peace to the Middle East, I was profoundly impressed again not only with your wisdom and your judgment and your sensitivity and insight but also with the close compatibility that we found in addressing this difficult question.
As we visit with leaders who have in their hands the responsibility for making decisions that can bring peace to the Middle East and ensure a peaceful existence for all of us who live in the world, no matter where our nations might be, it's important that we continue to benefit from your sound judgment and from your good advice.
We also had a chance to discuss another potential troubled area, the Horn of Africa. And here again we live at a great distance from it. But this region, which already sees the initiation of hostility and combat, needs to be brought under the good influence of you and others who live in this region. And we will be glad to cooperate in any way that we can. We want peace Go return. We want Somalia and Ethiopia to be friends again, border disputes to be eased and those of us who do have any influence at all to use that influence for these purposes.
We have also known about the great benefits that we derive in our own nation from the close business relationships that we have with Iran.
As I drove through the beautiful streets of Tehran today with the Shah, we saw literally thousands of Iranian citizens standing beside the street with a friendly attitude, expressing their welcome to me. And I also saw hundreds, perhaps even thousands of American citizens who stand there welcoming their President in a nation which has taken them to heart and made them feel at home. There are about 30,000 Americans here who work in close harmony with the people of Iran to carve out a better future for you, which also helps to ensure, Your Majesty, a better future for ourselves.
We share industrial growth, we share scientific achievements, we share research and development knowledge, and this gives us the stability for the present which is indeed valuable to both our countries.
We are also blessed with the largest number of foreign students in our country from your own nation. And I think this ensures, too, that we share the knowledge that is engendered by our great universities, but also that when these young leaders come back to your country for many years in the future, for many generations in the future, our friendship is ensured. We are very grateful for this and value it very much.
I have tried to become better acquainted with the culture of Iran in the preparation for my visit here. I was particularly impressed with a brief passage from one of Iran's great poets, Saadi. And I would like to read a few words from him. Empress Farah tells me that he lived about 600 years ago.
""Human beings are like parts of a body, created from the same essence. When one part is hurt and in pain, others cannot remain in peace and quiet. If the misery of others leaves you indifferent and with no feeling of sorrow, then you cannot be called a human being.""
I asked Empress Farah why this poet was so famous here in Iran, because he had impressed me so greatly, too. And she said that because he had the greatest facility for professing profound thoughts in the simplest possible words that the average citizen could understand.
Well, this brief passage shows that there is within the consciousness of human beings a close tie with one's neighbors, one's family, and one's friends, but it also ties us with human beings throughout the world. When one is hurt or suffers, all of us, if we are human beings, are hurt and we suffer.
The cause of human rights is one that also is shared deeply by our people and by the leaders of our two nations.
Our talks have been priceless, our friendship is irreplaceable, and my own gratitude is to the Shah, who in his wisdom and with his experience has been so helpful to me, a new leader.
We have no other nation on Earth who is closer to us in planning for our mutual military security. We have no other nation with whom we have closer consultation on regional problems that concern us both. And there is no leader with whom I have a deeper sense of personal gratitude and personal friendship.
On behalf of the people of the United States, I would like to offer a toast at this time to the great leaders of Iran, the Shah and the Shahbanou and to the people of Iran and to the world peace that we hope together we can help to bring.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"June 18, 1984","
President Reagan. Mr. President, Mrs. Jayewardene, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, it's a special pleasure to have you with us. Sri Lankan leaders, including yourself, Mr. President, have been to our country before. Tonight, however, is the first time that a Sri Lankan chief of state has been an official guest at the White House. It's our honor to have you with us, and Nancy and I hope your visit will be followed by many more.
Our talks this morning reflected the cordial and cooperative relationship which exists between our two democracies. When your government was first elected in 1977, Mr. President, Americans were excited by your bold program for economic development. And you've led your country in a new direction, and by doing so, you've created new opportunities for your people and expanded the potential of every Sri Lankan.
The accelerated Mahaweli River project is part of your effort, as is freeing the Sri Lankan economy from the controls and red tape that stifled progress and economic expansion. One innovation of particular interest to me, Mr. President, is the creation of a free trade zone. This practical approach to development with its open market is attracting investment and unleashing the energy of the private sector. And I hope those over on Capitol Hill who claim enterprise zones won't work here in our country will take notice of the progress that you've made.
We in the United States are happy that we've been able to contribute to your progress. Our Agency for International Development is working with you in the river program and encouraging Sri Lanka's private enterprise sector. With the incentives that you now offer to investors, your country is attracting business and capturing the attention of American entrepreneurs and investors. And I think we can look forward to growing cooperation between our governments and our people on many levels.
U.S..-Sri Lankan cooperation comes in many forms. Last year the Peace Corps began a program to assist in the upgrading of Sri Lanka's English language teaching skills. And today we signed a science and technology agreement which provides an umbrella for increased collaboration. And we look forward to the early completion of negotiating on a tax treaty and on a bilateral investment treaty. All this reflects the extraordinary relationship that we're building, a relationship of trust and trade that will benefit both our peoples.
Mr. President, we understand Sri Lanka's choice, as a small developing country, to remain nonaligned in matters of foreign policy. We respect genuine nonalignment. Your country consistently has been a forceful voice for reason and moderation in nonaligned councils. Your strong opposition to unprovoked aggression in Afghanistan and Kampuchea has swelled the international chorus calling for restoration of independence for these two brutalized countries. We hope that Sri Lanka will remain a strong moral force in world politics.
And today, Mr. President, we came to know one another better and to understand more fully our objectives and concerns. Your visit has undoubtedly strengthened the bond between our two countries, and it's laid a basis for even closer, more cooperative relations between Sri Lanka and the United States in the future.
And finally, Mr. President, I'd like to thank you again for the elephant— [laughter] —a magnificent present that you gave us today. The elephant happens to be the symbol of the President's political party, and by coincidence— [laughter] —we happen to be also that smart. [Laughter]
Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Jayewardene, and the prosperity of our relationship with Sri Lanka.
President Jayewardene. Mr. President, Madam Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, I don't mind, President Reagan telling the public that the gift of the elephant was accidental. [Laughter] But privately I know it's something else. [Laughter] The elephant led my party to victory in 1977. I received 51 percent of the votes. Any party that gets 51 percent of the votes must win an election. And I hope you will have the same luck in the months to come.
I came here as a stranger, but I find-already I feel I am among friends. I've heard that the American people are very friendly people, hospitable people. Both qualities have been proved during the last few days. I'm surrounded, I understand, by film stars. Those whom I saw in my youth were rather different. They were Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Fatty Arbuckle— [laughter] —and Mary Pickford.
I remember a story about Laurel and Hardy. They joined the French Legion. They were waiting in the inspecting line. The sergeant came and said, ""What are you doing here? Why do you join the French Legion?"" They said, ""We joined the French Legion to forget."" ""To forget what?"" ""We've forgotten."" [Laughter]
I haven't forgotten about the help your country has given us during the last few years. But I didn't Come here to ask for help. That's not my way. I'm waiting to hear Mr. Frank Sinatra sing ""My Way."" [Laughter] That's one of my favorite songs, but I understand he didn't like it. [Laughter] I used it in part of my election campaign and asked the people to vote for my way, which they did.
Your country is, as far as the Americans go, young. Our country is old, very old. We go back to the fifth century before Christ. We had Ambassadors at the court of Claudius Caesar. You'll find it recorded in Pliny's letters. He even mentions the name of the Ambassadors. We had sent delegations to China in 47 A.D. and I understand the gift sent by our king to the Emperor of China were water buffalos and hump cattle. The great Chinese pilgrims Hsuan-tsang and Fa-Hsien came to our country in the fourth century A.D. and the sixth century A.D. So did Sinbad the Sailor, Marco Polo, and Ibn Batuta.
For the first time, Westerners came in the 16th century and the Portuguese came as tourists but stayed for 150 years. After that came the Dutch and then came the English. And we are now, once again, a free country. We wish to be friendly with all and the enemies of none. That is my policy and the policy of our people.
We would like the people of America to understand us. In the long history of Sri Lanka, there have been difficult periods. There have been murders; there have been assassinations; there have been riots; there have been good deeds and bad deeds. Last July we had one of those bad periods. But in time to come, it will be forgotten.
I see in one of your newspapers there is an advertisement in which some people are trying to make us remember that day. It was a fatal day; several people were killed. It was not done by the government; it was done by a gang of hooligans, about which we are very, very sorry. I'm trying to forget it. I'm trying to make our people not commit—some of them—such incidents again. I hope we will succeed.
I remember when one of your representatives came to see me and had lunch with me. I told her—she is your representative in the United Nations organization—""A leader must know only two words."" She said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""Yes and no."" And I think President Reagan knows those two words very well. Once you say yes or once you say no, stick by it. Whatever happens, never change. That has been my policy, and it has succeeded.
Therefore, Mr. President, we're surrounded by friends. We've been very happy the last few days. I have a few more days to spend. I hope to spend some time in the Indian settlements at Santa Fe, not for any other reason but because those were the stories I read in my youth, about Buffalo Bill and the various tribes. I'm fascinated by the fact they were the oldest human settlements, as far as I know, in the continent of America, and a great people. And we must give them a helping hand as we must give every race, every tribe, every human being, whatever his caste, religion, or race, a helping hand.
We're all human beings. We extend our affection, not only to human beings but even to animals; to the little elephant that we have gifted to you. That is the philosophy which we have learned in our country; that is the philosophy which, if I can, I'll spread throughout the world. And I find in you, Mr. President and Madam Reagan, two very good disciples.
Thank you very much for entertaining us. May your country prosper. May, in the morning and in the evening, at nightfall, may the name of President Reagan and Madam Reagan, never be forgotten. Thank you.
May I drink to the health of President Reagan, Madam Reagan, the Government and people of the United States of America.

state-dinners,George Bush,"September 26, 1991","
The President. Your Majesty, Barbara and I are truly delighted to have this opportunity to welcome you and your daughter, Her Royal Highness Princess Lalla Meryem, to the United States.
You know, the pomp and circumstance at dinners like these never grows old. As we were descending the lovely staircase this evening, I have to confess that Barbara and I felt like movie stars. To steal a line from Humphrey Bogart, ""Welcome to Casablanca."" [Laughter]
But, Your Majesty, the friendship between our two countries stretches back more than 200 years, back beyond even the autumn of 1788, when the Emperor of Morocco, Mohammed III, sent warm words of support and encouragement to the then newly-elected President of the United States, a brand new President receiving these greetings back in 1788. And for me, the friendship between Morocco and the United States has been quite personal.
Of course Barbara and I remember our visit. I fondly remember this visit to Morocco as Vice President in 1983, the crowds in Fez and in Rabat who welcomed us as we drove through those cities in an open car. And I recall your gracious invitation to put aside some of the pomp of state and inviting us to dine together along with many members of your family, surrounded by friends. It's something we will never forget.
And at critical moments in history, our two nations have acted in concert: earlier this century, when 300,000 Moroccans fought with the Allies against the Axis powers in World War II; and last year when Morocco once again demonstrated its commitment to shared ideals by sending its troops to the defense of Saudi Arabia.
Just as we've worked together to frustrate aggression, so we can work together to promote peace and stability in the Middle East, in the Gulf, and in Western Sahara. It will be the work of old friends, building a new world order.
So, let me ask all of you to stand and to raise your glasses to the health of King Hassan and his family, to a future blessed by peace, and to the common bonds of friendship that link the people of Morocco and the United States of America. Welcome, Your Majesty.
The King. Mr. President and dear friend, Mrs. Bush, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentleman: I want first to ask you to pardon my bad accent, please. I am delighted to say that my present state visit in the United States of America will certainly be for me a memorable one; for not only was the welcome party very warm, but the talks we had were suffused with that same openness and sincerity which have always characterized our contacts for the last 10 years.
Mr. President, God's will has always been to grant you success in whatever position you held, and in all the issues you had to handle. This is certainly due to your personal abilities and qualities, but also due in part to Mrs. Bush, a God-given companion. Constant support and dispenser of affection and serenity, so indispensable to any head of state. With Mrs. Bush here present, kindly accept the expression of my sincere consideration and admiration.
Mr. President, may the United States of America enjoy under your clairvoyant leadership an era of prosperity, and participate fully in the edification of harmonious and constant free cohabitation among the nations of the Earth.
As I thank you again for your gracious hospitality, I invoke, hoping you, Mr. President, the help of the Almighty, wishing you excellent health and full success in your endeavors. Long life to the United States of America. Long life for kingdom of Morocco.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"September 10, 1985","
Prime Minister Schluter, Mrs. Schluter, and distinguished visitors, welcome to the White House. It's been a pleasure to have you as our guests. As one would expect between close allies, our meeting today with the Prime Minister was straightforward, useful, and reflected the genuine friendship of our countrymen.
I was happy to have had the opportunity to congratulate you, Prime Minister Schluter, on the success that you've had in your country in putting in place economy building measures, including a far-reaching tax reform program. [Laughter] I can well imagine how difficult that task has been. [Laughter] Our efforts at tax reform remind me of one of Denmark's better known fairy tales. When I talk about reforming the tax shelter—or system, I should say, I can visualize a beautiful swan. All the special interests see is an ugly duckling. [Laughter] I think the national debate over tax reform reflects the strength and soul of our democracy. The outcome is still in doubt. Every citizen is free to participate in the decisionmaking process. All sides are going to the people to muster support, and once the issue has been voted on and settled, there will be no recriminations. The losers won't be sent to some gulag. Everyone—winners and losers—will feel proud to live in a country committed to freedom of speech and press and dedicated to the principles of representative government.
This is what binds not just Americans but the free citizens of all lands, especially the people of our two countries. That bond is evident in so many ways. Perhaps the most impressive is in the magnificence of one of the resounding monuments to American freedom—the great stone carvings on Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. There, the son of Danish immigrants, Gutzon Borglum, immortalized in granite the faces of Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln. He died before he saw the completion of his work, but his son carried on. And today it stands as a tribute to the flame of liberty that burns red hot in the soul of a man with roots in America and Denmark.
One of the greatest threats to freedom is that it will never be taken for granted—or, pardon me, I should say, it will be taken for granted is the threat. It never should be. But there are many reasons for confidence. And a story I came across recently truly inspired me, and I'd like to share it with you. Ms. Drake is here in the audience, who brought this story to my attention. Natalia and Nels Mortensen, both in their eighties, live in a small town of Marstal on the island of Aero in Denmark. For the last 40 years, they have been tending the grave site of a young man they never met. They dig the weeds out, they place flowers—red, white, and blue ones—on the grave, and always there is a small American flag, and when it gets too worn, they replace it with another.
They're watching over the final resting place of U.S. Air Force Sergeant Jack Elwood Wagner, who died when his plane was shot down off the coast of that island, fell into the sea after a bombing raid over enemy territory on June 20th, 1944. Jack Wagner's body washed up on shore in occupied Denmark 18 days after his bomber crashed, and the word spread quickly. When the Nazi occupation troops finally arrived to bury the young American, they found nearly the whole town of 2,000 had been waiting at the graveyard since early that morning to pay tribute and homage to the young American flyer. The path had already been lined with flowers. And when the enemy troops—they, incidentally, had removed his identification before the troops had arrived—when the troops had laid him in his grave and left, then the townspeople placed two banners of red, white, and blue flowers on the grave. They conducted a funeral service. One of the banners had a ribbon which read, ""Thank you for what you have done.""
Jack Wagner was a 19-year-old American from Snyder County, Pennsylvania. They'd never met him, yet the people of the small town—thousands of miles from his home-felt they knew him, because they said he was a young man who gave his life for their freedom. The Mortensens have tended his grave four decades now, just as if he were a member of the family. We invited them to be here tonight, but they wrote and told me that, at their age, they didn't believe that they could take on such a long trip. But Jack Wagner's sister is here tonight-Mrs. Woll, would you stand for just a second and let us— [applause] . She has been to Denmark to meet the Mortensens and to thank them for what they've done.
Let all of us learn from their devotion. After our meeting today and the heartfelt good will of this evening, I think we can all be certain that in the future our two peoples will continue to stand side by side as members of the same family—the family of free people. Incidentally, I should have added that, with the age of the Mortensens, the village in which they live has already officially made it plain that when they can no longer care for the grave, the village will take it over as an official function of that village.
So, I think we shall have two toasts tonight. First, a toast to Her Majesty, the Queen of Denmark—to the Queen. And would you also join me in a toast to Prime Minister and Mrs. Schliiter and to our Danish friends and allies.
Pete Rose has been at bat twice, and he hasn't hit yet. [Laughter]

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"February 24, 1999","
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. I want to welcome President Rawlings and Mrs. Rawlings and the entire Ghanaian delegation, along with the distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and our other distinguished guests to the White House. Hillary and I are delighted to see you all here.
There was so much interest and enthusiasm about this dinner that we had to move it from the dining room into the East Room. And you might be interested to know that it was in this room that Thomas Jefferson met with Meriwether Lewis to plan the great Lewis and Clark expedition, which explored the American Continent. It is fitting that we are having this dinner here, almost 200 years later, to chart a new century and to explore our relationship with Ghana and with Africa.
It was no accident that Ghana was our first stop, our gateway to Africa, when Hillary and I and our delegation, the Members of Congress, the administration, and citizens traveled to Africa last year. Mr. President, in the last decade, under your leadership, Ghana has made great strides toward fulfilling President Nkrumah's vision of a proud, strong country.
In important ways, it may even have surpassed that vision. Starting our African journey in a democratic country with a growing economy, a powerful commitment to tolerance at home and peace around the world allowed us to highlight for all Americans the progress that Africa has made and the promise of our future together. It allowed us to reaffirm for all of Africa that the United States is proud and determined to build a partnership of mutual respect with African nations which share our dreams of a better world. It also gave us the opportunity to get to know Ghana.
It has become the subject of some raw humor in the White House that I never tire of telling people that we had a half a million people in Independence Square in Ghana. About—[applause]—thank you. Every time the Vice President gets a good news story these days, I say, ""But have you ever spoken to a half a million people?"" [Laughter]
Let me say also, Mr. President, we all know that you have so many friends in the United States, quite a few here tonight. I want to mention, though, an astonishing fact that I learned about a friend of Ghana and yours who is not here tonight—also a friend of mine, who performed here for the Prime Minister of Great Britain—Stevie Wonder. He spends considerable time in Ghana, and actually, Mr. President, he has boasted in the United States that he's flown your airplane. [Laughter] I hope you wore a seat belt. [Laughter] With a story like that, he may be planning to run for office soon.
I want you all to know I have spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about President Rawlings' political predicament. Listen to this: He was elected President by his fellow citizens in 1992. He was reelected in 1996. He loves his country, and he loves being President of his country. His Constitution prevents him from running again in 2000. [Laughter] Mr. President, I feel your pain. [Laughter]
It seems to me the only response for two slightly scarred but energetic warriors like us is to renew our commitment and dedication in these remaining 2 years of our service, to make them count every day for all our people, so that when our citizens choose new leadership for a new century, we can know that we have done our best to pave their way.
So let us tonight commit together to work on the things that matter to real people and to the children and their future: to strengthen our democracies; to broaden the reach of our economies; to make education and health care better and more widely available; to protect our environment; to work to convince others to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts within and among the nations we can reach. And let us commit to making the bonds between our two nations stronger than ever.
Mr. President, Nana, it is a profound honor for Hillary and for me to have you here. And we now ask all of you to join us in a toast to the President and the First Lady and the people of Ghana.

state-dinners,George Bush,"May 31, 1990","
President Bush. Friends and distinguished guests, and especially President and Mrs. Gorbachev, Barbara and I are delighted to welcome you to the White House to share bread and salt with us on this special evening.
We're now nearing the end of a momentous day, the first of 4 in this Washington summit. And tomorrow, Mr. President, comes the moment that so many have been waiting for, a day when expectations will be at a fever pitch. That's right, tomorrow Barbara and Raisa go to Wellesley College. [Laughter]
And back here at the White House, sir, we will meet again, this time to sign our names to a series of agreements that signify the progress that our two nations have made in forging a new relationship, agreements on everything from nuclear testing and chemical weapons to expanded contacts between the people of America and the people of the Soviet Union. These agreements are a continuation of all that began in Malta just 6 months ago, a foundation we can build on, proof that differences can be resolved even while others remain. And let me assure President Gorbachev: Whatever deep differences divided us in the past, the United States and the American people approach every issue with a sincere belief that our two nations can find common ground. Indeed, because of our unique positions in the world, we must find common ground.
We meet at a time of great and historic change in the Soviet Union, in Europe, and around the world. Such profound change is unsettling, but also exhilarating. And we don't shrink from the challenges before us, but we welcome them, determined to build the foundations of enduring peace and security.
Mr. President, you deserve great credit for the course that you have chosen, for the political and economic reforms that you have introduced, and for creating within the Soviet Union this commitment to change. As I said this morning when I welcomed you to the White House, we want to see perestroika succeed. We want to see this transition now underway in the Soviet Union maintain its momentum.
Mr. President, it's said that your country is the land of possibilities. You have demonstrated the truth of that statement. And we've seen this past year that ours is a world of possibilities, that our time is a time of historic change, a time when men and nations can transform history, can turn possibility into progress, into peace. So, let us raise our glasses to our guests, President and Mrs. Gorbachev, to the growing friendship between American and Soviet people and to the possibilities now open to us, to the prospect of progress and lasting peace.
President Gorbachev. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, ladies and gentlemen, allow me on behalf of Mrs. Gorbachev and myself and all the members of our delegation to thank you for your warmth and for the kind words of President Bush.
We share the assessment of President Bush that we have done fruitful work today, and I'm sure that as a result of this meeting our countries will go to a new level of cooperation. Even now our relations, to which history assigned such an important role in the events and lessons of the 20th century, differ dramatically from what they were before the 1985 Geneva summit. To achieve this, we have worked together.
The enemy image is becoming a thing of the past. Ideological stereotypes are fading away. We have begun to understand each other's motives. As we are changing and becoming closer to each other, we have not ceased to be different. But it turns out that that is not so bad. Quite the opposite: it is useful, for diversity is a vital force of development.
The world, too, has changed beyond recognition. It has made significant progress toward a new period of genuine peace in its long history. I think we can say with confidence that the most important and decisive step in this direction was made by our countries. Our two countries had the will, common sense, and understanding of the situation and of the imperatives of the future to embark on a long and difficult road which led from Geneva via Reykjavik, Washington, Moscow, and New York to Malta, and now once again to Washington.
Today I would like to repeat here what I said to the President 6 months ago at Malta. The Soviet Union does not regard the United States as its enemy. We have firmly adopted the policy of moving from mutual understanding through cooperation to joint action. Today, when I was meeting some American intellectuals at the Soviet Embassy, I said to them this: ""Yes, indeed, we used to be enemies, or almost enemies. Now we are, maybe, rivals, at least to some extent. And we want to become partners. We want to go all the way to become friends.""
Improved Soviet-American relations have reduced the threat of war. This is the main achievement of these years. We have concluded close to 20 bilateral agreements in various fields. There has been an unprecedented expansion of exchanges among our people -- and that is especially valuable -- from schoolchildren to prominent personalities in the fields of science and the economy. I think that the work we have been doing together with President Bush during these days can be considered as another step toward a more humane and just world.
I cannot say yet how we are going to conclude this meeting, what the results would be. That would be premature. But I think that my talk today with the President and also the meeting of the delegations makes it possible to expect major results from this meeting, and maybe even major results, the biggest results, compared to all the other meetings in previous Soviet-American summits. Maybe I'm too optimistic, but let's wait and see. We have 2 days. I believe that maybe we will have those major results.
I feel that we're now witnessing the emergence of a general idea which is conquering people's minds on the eve of the 21st century: it is the idea of unity. To make this idea a reality is a truly monumental challenge. The world's diversity and its complex problems are such that we can only do it by synthesizing, or at least interlinking, the aspirations, values, achievements, and hopes of different nations.
In the world confronted with the nuclear, environmental, and other threats, global unity means a chance for the survival of our civilization. But mankind cannot be merely a community of survival. It should be a community of progress, progress for all, the East, the West, the North, the South, the highly developed, and the less fortunate. But today we have to rethink the whole idea of progress. Mankind's ascent toward the realization of the idea of its history should not result in irreparable damage to the environment, in the exploitation of man or entire nations, or in irreversible moral and ethical losses.
It is a difficult and novel task to build a new civilization. Coming from a country in which more than 100 nationalities live together, we know that, perhaps better than anyone else, our own house is in need of an overhaul and a fundamental restructuring along the lines of reason and justice. We are aware of the magnitude of this undertaking, unprecedented in the history of mankind.
Judging by the response of the rest of the world to our perestroika, we can conclude that it is a necessary and desirable element of mankind's political and philosophical potential. That is why, while rethinking that potential and restructuring ourselves, we believe that we are making a contribution to the cause of universal development and universal unity.
We have not yet completed the task of creating a durable democratic system in our country, but I am convinced that the reserves of our society's energy already committed to this great undertaking are enough to bring it to its completion. I can say this firmly: We shall act on the basis of our values; we shall move resolutely but prudently.
The goal of our policy is to bring our society to a qualitatively new level. This will enable us to be predictable participants in the international process, partners to all who want a secure, just, and free world. In building this world, we count on long-term cooperation of the United States of America.
The most important developments in relations between our two countries and in world politics are probably yet to come. It is important not to lose sight of our goal, to resist the temptation of trying to secure unilateral advantages. Let us move ahead while overcoming both current and future problems and roadblocks. Let us cooperate and work together.
To the health of Mrs. Barbara Bush and to your health, Mr. President, to the success and well-being of all those present here, to a life worthy of today, and to our common and better future. Thank you.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"June 24, 1980","
Mr. President, American colleagues, and Yugoslav friends:
Although this is my first visit to your great country, Yugoslavia, the special relationship between our two countries has involved seven American Presidents, beginning with President Harry Truman. I'm here to confirm the continuity of that relationship. I'm here to reiterate our firm support of Yugoslavia's independence, territorial integrity, and unity and our respect for Yugoslavia's nonaligned position.
These are the principles which President Tito and I emphasized during his visit to the United States a little more than 2 years ago. I want you to know that they are just as central to American policy now as they were then, when our country was honored by the presence of this great leader.
It is with great sadness that I pay here tonight a personal tribute to President Tito. I regarded him as a friend, as well as a statesman of uncommon vision. I valued his counsel, his wisdom, and his perspective. I gained many insights from our personal correspondence, which continued even during the final months of his illness.
Great men of history sometimes leave the nations they have led ill equipped to face the world without them. What has impressed me in my brief visit here is how smoothly you have met the challenge of transition. That is a great tribute not only to the foresight of President Tito but also to the dedication and the patriotism of his political heirs.
A man like President Tito cannot be replaced. It is the nature of such men to be irreplaceable, but the courage and the creativity of the Yugoslav people guarantee that President Tito's life's work of building a strong, independent Yugoslavia will go forward in the years ahead.
Yugoslavia's unswerving defense of the principles of true nonalignment and nonintervention in the internal affairs of foreign states is particularly important in today's unstable and troubled world. The United States respects such a policy.
It has always been my hope as President that we could move on in many areas of the world from conflict to peace. I did look forward to significant contributions in arms control when the SALT II treaty was signed. Ratification of this treaty has been temporarily frustrated, but not abandoned.
We are deeply concerned that an unjustifiable act of armed aggression continues in Afghanistan, a founding member with you of the nonaligned movement, a small country, which, as you well know, constituted no threat to anyone. The vast majority of the countries of the world, in an extraordinary vote by the General Assembly of the United Nations, have called for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan. We want to see the restoration of an independent and nonaligned Afghanistan, which can live in peace with all its neighbors and contribute to the stability of the region.
With the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Afghanistan, we would be prepared to join in assurances and arrangements to establish a truly independent, a truly nonaligned Afghanistan with a government acceptable to the Afghan people. We would be prepared to explore a transitional arrangement, to be implemented along with the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Afghanistan, for the purpose of restoring peace and tranquillity in that suffering country.
Mr. President, our talks today have also touched on the grave consequences of politically motivated terrorism. I speak for every American citizen when I say how much we appreciate Yugoslavia's forthright support for the release of the American diplomatic personnel who at this moment are held hostage in Iran, in violation of every tenet not only of international law but of simple decency.
For my part, I want to reiterate that my Government will not tolerate terrorist acts against Yugoslav officials and establishments in the United States and that we strongly oppose political efforts aimed at undermining Yugoslavia's unity and territorial integrity.
Mr. President, our talks today have confirmed my view that Yugoslavia's concept of nonalignment is not a passive or quiescent thing, but a bold, creative, imaginative approach to the problems of the world, particularly the problems of the developing nations. And our talks have confirmed something else, that both Yugoslavia and the United States want to strengthen the bilateral relationships that exist between us and that we want to do so on the basis of independence, equality, and mutual respect.
I would like to thank you, on behalf of my family and my colleagues, for your generous hospitality and friendship. I look forward to a continuing exchange with you on international issues, on which we share so many compatible views, and also on bilateral issues, on which we've made such great progress in recent years.
I would like to ask everyone to join me as I raise my glass in a toast: To the Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to its President, his Excellency President Mijatovic; to a strong and prosperous Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; to the peoples of Yugoslavia, whose love of independence we admire and support; and to the furthering, strengthening of American-Yugoslav friendship in the cause of peace and stability throughout the world.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"November 09, 2010","
President Yudhoyono, Mrs. Yudhoyono, to all the distinguished guests who are here today, thank you for this extraordinary honor. I am proud and humbled to accept this award on behalf of my mother. And although she could not be here in person, I know that my sister Maya Soetoro would be equally proud.
Now, I'm going to have the opportunity to speak tomorrow, and so I will try to keep my remarks brief. First of all, thank you for the bakso--[laughter]--and the nasi goreng, the emping, the kerupuk. [Laughter] Semuanya enak. [Laughter] Thank you very much.
But the fact, President, that you would choose to recognize my mother in this way speaks to the bonds that she forged over many years with the people of this magnificent country. And in honoring her, you honor the spirit that led her to travel into villages throughout the country, often on the back of motorcycles, because that was the only way to get into some of these villages.
She believed that we all share common aspirations: to live in dignity and security, to get an education, to provide for our families, to give our children a better future, to leave the world better than we found it. She also believed, by the way, in the importance of educating girls and empowering women, because she understood that when we provide education to young women, when we honor and respect women, that we are in fact developing the entire country. That's what kept bringing my mother back to this country for so many years, that's the lesson that she passed on to me, and that's the lesson that Michelle and I try to pass on to our daughters.
So on behalf of our entire family, we thank you. I am deeply moved. It is this same largeness of heart that compels us tonight to keep in our thoughts and prayers all those who are suffering from the eruptions and the tsunami and the earthquake. With so many in need tonight, that's one more reason for me to keep my remarks short.
As a young boy in Menteng Dalam 40 years ago, I could never imagine that I would one day be hosted here at Istana Negara--never mind as President of the United States. I didn't think I would be stepping into this building ever. [Laughter]
And I know that much has been made about how a young boy could move between such different countries and cultures as Indonesia and the United States. But the truth is, is that our countries have far more in common than most people realize. We are two peoples who both broke free from colonial rule. We are both two vast nations that stretch thousands of miles. We are both two societies that find strength in our diversity. And we are two democracies where power resides in the people. And so it's only natural that we should be partners in the world.
I am fortunate to have a very strong partner in President Yudhoyono, Indonesia's first directly elected President, and a leader who has guided this nation through its journey into democracy. And our two nations are fortunate that we are forging a partnership for the 21st century. And as we go forward, I'm reminded of a proverb: Bagai air dengan tebing--like bamboo and the river bank, we rely on each other.
And so I'd like to propose a toast. In the spirit of friendship between our two countries, we are reminded of the truth that no nation is an island, not even when you're made up of thousands of islands. We all rely on each other together, like bamboo and the river bank. And like my mother riding between villages on a motorcycle, we are all stronger and safer when we see our common humanity in each other.
So, President Yudhoyono, and to all the distinguished guests who are here, thank you for your extraordinary friendship and the warmth with which you have received Michelle and myself. And I promise that it won't take so long before I come back.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"April 15, 1972","
President Mora, Your Excellencies, and ladies and gentlemen:
I understand that during the past week that all of you have been exposed to a great number of speeches and tonight therefore, at this very, shall we say, friendly occasion, I hesitate to impose upon you another speech. But I will speak briefly and then I would like to add a few words directly in a very personal sense to those who are members of what I call, and what I think most of you call, the American family, our family.
First, we want to welcome you here, as I have welcomed you previously. Yesterday in the Canadian Parliament, as Senator Aiken, who is Canada's Senator in the United States Senate, they told me at least, in any event, knows, I was told that unless I spoke some French I would have no success in my speech. So I went back 37 years and picked out a few words and one way or another managed some French that some probably misunderstood.
But whatever the case might be, let me say that as far as my Spanish is concerned, it is limited, but it is from the heart when I say, ""Estan ustcdes en su casa,"" and we are very honored to welcome you here again.
As you know, we come from southern California and we have a strong Spanish heritage--not only where we lived, but also our honeymoon was in Mexico and we have memories that we will always carry with us of those times. So our home in San Clemente, California, is one that we named Casa Pacifica. Casa Pacifica has two meanings. If you have seen this home, it is one that has a magnificent view of the Pacific so it is ""The House on the Pacific"" or ""of the Pacific."" But also it has another sense. It also, we believe and trust, will be recorded in history as a ""House of Peace."" And therefore we think that that Spanish word, Casa Pacifica, and that sentiment is one that should particularly characterize our thoughts tonight.
When we think of Pan American Week, it is hard to realize that 82 years ago the First International Conference established the International Union of American Republics, which of course was the forerunner of this organization.
And we have to realize and I have noted that during the course of your discussions that we have had some differences, differences this week and differences over those 82 years, but considering what happened in those 82 years, in the Americas and in the world, it would be considered remarkable that an organization like this, which is comprised, as it is, of many diverse viewpoints, could endure at all over these eight decades of change.
So, we stand tonight, not only in existence in the OAS, but we stand poised for even more progress as partners. But let me put the term partners in a different sense: Partners in principles, but not necessarily partners in every policy. And, of course, partners in principle is what really matters.
This week has been Pan American Week, in creative deeds as well as in the generalized words of the customary proclamations and resolutions. Yesterday, on Pan American Day, I addressed the Parliament of Canada, as I referred to a moment ago, the American nation of the North. And tonight, here in Washington, we gather with the representatives of the American nations of the South, after a week of conferences that you have had.
We are, in the year 1972, in a year that world attention is focused on East-West relations, the relations for example of the great powers, great in terms of their military strength, their potential military strength--the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet Union and China, China and the United States. And in this year of East-West activities, it is good for the United States and for all our fellow American nations to devote this week to the vitality of the North-South relationship. Because, as I said in Canada, at a time that we in the United States, we believe in the interest of world peace, are attempting to develop a new relationship with our adversary, it is enormously important to develop better relationships with our friends and particularly our friends in the American community.
Our Western Hemisphere ties provide the basic strengths which sustain us as we move toward that goal.
And now if I could turn to my good friend Galo Plaza [Secretary General, Organization of American States]. He spoke of the ""fresh winds of change"" that are blowing through the OAS and through the Americas in general and he is right. And we have felt those winds of change. That is good, that we have felt them and, frankly, that they are blowing, because we live in a world in which there must be change, change for the better, progress for all people.
Our basic policy position is a new practical acknowledgment that the general term ""Latin America"" now means something that it didn't used to mean. It means not a uniform voice, Latin America, all those countries down there speaking with one voice, one language, in a sense, but rather a plurality of views.
If I could interpolate here, I am the first President of the United States who has visited every country in Central America and every country in South America, and I know that what the State Department tells every visitor to these parts of the world before he goes, and what they told me is true. That the greatest mistake a traveler in Central America and South America and, for that matter, the Caribbean can make, is to assume that it is just one great part of the world that is very much alike. It is alike in many ways, but very different in other ways. They are proud peoples, they are different peoples. Many speak the same language, many have the same ideals, but, on the other hand, the important thing for us in the United States to do is to recognize and respect each country in Latin America for what it is and what it stands for and to know them for what they are and what they stand for. This I know from having traveled to all of these countries.
We recognize that diversity has resulted in different kinds of government within Latin America, with varying national goals and methods, and we realize that all of this presents problems.
The United States is no stranger to policy differences and to the efforts needed to forge strengths from the fires of discord.
Consequently, we stand prepared to work as a mature and equal partner on the inevitable differences that have arisen and have continued to arise because of the developing new realities in the American hemisphere.
Let us all recognize that when we talk about differences there are some things that will not change as far as U.S. policy is concerned. We will continue to give a special priority to our unique relationships with Latin America.
I say that here; I could say it also with regard to all of the American hemisphere, to the Americas generally, to Canada, and to the American family in its largest sense. We have special relationships with many countries in the world, but priority must necessarily go to our closest friends and our closest neighbors in the American hemisphere.
We will deal realistically with governments as they are, not seeking to impose our political structure on other nations. We recognize that each nation must seek its own way and we respect the fight of all people in the various countries with whom we deal in the American family to seek their own way, and we shall continue to demonstrate our deep humanitarian concern for the people of the hemisphere.
If I could interject here just a sense of the feeling that Mrs. Nixon and I have for the countries that you the Foreign Ministers, the Ambassadors, and the others represent here today.
We think of you as representatives of government and we respect you as representatives of government. But also, we think of you as representatives of people. When I think of Latin America I remember, for example, the friends I have met there. I remember a very handsome, vigorous, young man from the Foreign Office--he was young then, in 1955. He had gone to the University of California, had played football, had been a great star and was back in his country of El Salvador, his name means nothing to you. It was Quinones. But he was such a good man and strong man and spoke so fervently about his small country that I realized and sensed from him the sentiment that the people in the countries to the south have for their countries, the patriotism they feel for their countries, large or small.
I remember a ride one night, as we were going to a state dinner in Bolivia. We were riding down a mountain road. It was rather dark and we saw along the road a group of students gathered. They were young students and their teachers were there with them. I asked the driver, ""Who are they?"" They were waving. He said, ""That is the school for the blind."" We stopped the car. We got out. We shook their hands, a few of them. We talked to the Sister who was in charge of the school.
I have seen and my wife has, schools for the blind all over the world. But only as you see and feel the hand of a blind person can you realize the universality of the feelings each of us has in his heart for all the people of this world. And I shall always remember that school for the blind in La Paz, Bolivia.
And then my wife had an experience that she says was the mountain top experience of her travels in the world. She went to Peru after the 1970 earthquake, and she flew with Senora Velasco,1 for whom we gave a dinner, a luncheon here, into the earthquake zone. She saw the great tragedy, all of the destruction, but what impressed her was the courage, the strength, the dignity of the people, young and old, those beautiful faces in the face of adversity they are going to build a new country, and she brought back with her therefore a feeling for the people of Peru which she communicated to me, and I think also communicated to the American people.
What I am saying to my friends here in the American family--we do not think of you simply as representatives of government, but we think of you very truly as members of our family. There are blind people in our family. There are people who have suffered adversity, and Peru, of course, has had another earthquake. There are people who are old friends and dear friends, and it is that special relationship that we hope that all Americans can understand, because as we understand that we are a family, then we can develop a more understandable policy for the Americas.
What I am suggesting here is that an intangible force forms the basis of the solidarity among the Americas. This force was well defined over 50 years ago by another President standing in this room. Listen to his words Woodrow Wilson: ""We must prove ourselves their friends and champions upon terms of equality and honor. You cannot be friends upon any other terms than upon the terms of equality. You cannot be friends at all except upon the terms of honor. We must show ourselves friends by comprehending their interest whether it squares with our own interest or not.""
I say to you tonight, we, the United States, do comprehend. The United States is and will remain your friend, your champion, no matter what difficulties present themselves, in your countries, in ours, or any place on earth.
Now comes the time for the traditional toast at this dinner. There are so many people of high rank that we would have to go around the table Chinese style, tipping every glass in order to do it adequately, but I am afraid most of us probably couldn't survive the evening in the event we did that, so we have selected one of your members, the President of this Organization, as the one who will receive the toast on behalf of all of you.
Before toasting this very distinguished statesman, President Mora, let me say a word about the profession he represents. He is one who has been in diplomacy most of his life, as most of you have been in diplomacy. Now diplomats have very difficult times in every country, including the United States, but let me tell you how very important they are. I had it brought home to me today.
I signed a very thick treaty today with the Prime Minister of Canada. They brought the treaty over, they turned the page, they said, ""Sign here."" And I signed. Now as a lawyer, or a former lawyer, I know better than to sign something without reading it. Why did I sign it? I will tell you why.
While the Prime Minister of Canada and I were being seen on television, while we were meeting, a meeting at the summit of our two countries, discussing these important things, the work was being done that made possible our agreements, by scores of able, dedicated people. Some were Foreign Ministers, some were Secretaries of State, others were at other levels in their Foreign Service, but all were enormously important.
I simply want to say that in this year of summitry, here is one who goes to the summit, who knows that without the help of those who make it possible for him to go, who dig out the little places on those mountains where you step before you get to the top, there could be no summitry whatever.
And for that reason, as I raise my glass with yours, to the President of this Organization, let me say, it is raised to all of those in this room who have given your lives to the service of diplomacy, to the service of peace and therefore to the service of your own country and to the American family. So I ask that you rise, raise your glasses to la familia americana and to President Mora.

The President. Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Fraser, our Australian friends, and our friends from America:
Today has been a great pleasure. As Prime Minister Fraser and I discussed bilateral issues and world questions, it was clear that the bonds between us and the bonds between our two countries are strong. We're both committed to growth economies based on free enterprise. As the Prime Minister said, ""A philosophy can't be mere words. It must guide policy and be expressed in action."" And this he has done—bringing down inflation, spurring growth by cutting government spending, limiting bureaucracy, abolishing unnecessary regulations, and cutting taxes. You know, we ought to try something like that here. [Laughter]
But in his words, Australia has ""passed the ball to private enterprise which has now picked it up and is running hard."" Well, we in America are on our way to doing the same thing. And internationally, our ideas are also similar. We both recognize the responsibility of freedom and are prepared to shoulder it squarely. In culture and business, our societies cooperate to share opportunities, understanding, and friendships. We've hit on only one minor snag, and that happens to be sporting competition. Now, the America's Cup I understand; that's friendly—we always win. [Laughter] But the U.S. Open is something else again. [Laughter] And David Graham says he isn't through with us yet. [Laughter]
But Australia, like America, is a country where anything can happen and where anything can be achieved because people are free. ""Australian history,"" Mark Twain wrote, ""is full of surprises and adventures and incongruities and contradictions and incredibilities, but they're all true. They all happened."" [Laughter] Well it's the same way here, but that's our secret. We do not stagnate in a planned and withering government-dominated existence. We're free to be all that we can imagine.
A few moments ago at the table, I was asking Mrs. Fraser—just checking out my memory to make sure it was correct, and that is a very wonderful day that is observed annually in Australia in commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea, the turning point in World War II, where once again, as we've been so often, we were allied. And I have on my desk the tribute that was rendered at one of those particular days of commemoration by an Australian and his recognition of the blood bond between Americans and Australians who died together to turn that war around and to make Australia safe. I didn't dare read it here because I don't think I could have gotten through it tonight.
But the dynamics of the Australian way of life make her an even more powerful ally, and the vitality of her people make her an even stronger friend. So I would like to propose a toast to the Prime Minister of Australia and Mrs. Fraser, to the continued friendship and cooperation between our two countries, and to Her Majesty the Queen.
The Queen.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen:
Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your kind and gracious remarks. But may I first, with your permission, let your guests here this evening into a small secret between us, which is a source of special pleasure to me? Ladies and gentlemen, the President is exploiting one of my weaknesses, and I freely confess it. He's given me a magnificent fishing rod. [Laughter] I'm not sure whether there's some message in this. I don't know whether he should be encouraging me to wade in deep waters. But I'm sure that if I do, he'd want me to make a big catch. And when I catch a fish with this particular rod, I'll always be wondering who it is on the end of it. [Laughter] That's got a particular relevance for certain people in Australia. Mr. President, it's a splendid gift, and I thank you very much indeed for it.
I speak as one dedicated to the principles of small government, low inflation, and short after dinner speeches. [Laughter] And fortunately, what I have to say can be said simply and briefly. It's been a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. President, and to exchange views with you today. We weren't able to raise many arguments. I wasn't altogether surprised at that, because I had watched from afar and read what you'd had to say and had seen what you'd been doing, and I applaud it.
You and I, your government and mine, your country and mine share basic values and principles. We have confidence in the enterprise and judgment of free men and women living in open societies and conducting their own affairs without too much government interference. We maintain that the role of governments we lead and of all other governments should be a limited one and wish that that were more widely recognized in more countries, I think, around the world.
We know that the market economy has delivered the goods in the past and believe that it can continue to deliver them while allowing people the greatest freedom of choice. We believe that liberty is worth defending, and we're not inhibited in saying so. We believe that nothing is gained and a good deal is lost by pretending that tyranny is not tyranny, even if we have to deal with those who perpetrate it. And we know that in an imperfect world, those who wish to remain free must also remain strong and united. This, I suggest, is not a bad basis of agreement to be getting on with.
I happen to believe that the future of free societies is going to depend crucially on the quality of leadership they produce in the immediate future. That leadership must both recognize danger and stimulate confidence, for in recent years, our societies have simultaneously suffered from comforting illusions about their enemies and from doubt and uncertainty about themselves.
The feeling of these illusions and doubts has become, I suspect in both our countries in past years, a major intellectual growth industry. The trend must be reversed, and reversing will require courage, imagination, and staying power.
Leadership is more than a matter of position papers, options, and management. It is a matter of poise, of inner conviction, of the self-assurance that comes from being at ease with one's self—of what Ernest Hemingway summed up as ""grace under pressure."" It is also being able to embody and express the deepest aspirations of ordinary men and women, because that is what our kind of governments is all about, and that is what we stand for and that is our purpose.
It is that sort of leadership that free people throughout the world are looking for, and it is that sort of leadership that you, Mr. President, just by being yourself, have begun to provide. And this is clear from the spirit beginning to show in this United States.
Mr. President, we in Australia have arrived at our own independent conclusions as to what is needed if peace, freedom, and prosperity are to be maintained in the world. We've done so living far from the centers of Western intellectual and cultural fashions which, given the nature of those fashions in recent years, has perhaps given us an unfair advantage. [Laughter]
We've been prepared to advance our views when they were somewhat less popular than they are now. But the fact that they have become more accepted will not cause us to put them less vigorously or to change course. I have nothing against being in a majority occasionally. [Laughter]
Mr. President, until today I've observed your Presidency from a considerable distance. And they say that distance, or should I say a long shot, lends color to the view. But in this instance, I'm feeling that things look much better even close-up.
For your own sake and for the sake of the free world, I wish you well, Mr. President, over the next 3 1/2 years. And I ask everyone here to join me in drinking to your health and to the health of this great country and of all the American people.
Mr. President.
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"October 21, 1986","
The President. Well now, normally I would just start saying thank you, and one of the nicer parts of the job I've got is getting to know the leaders of other countries. But I know that the leader of the other country will forgive me for a little American thing that has to be said right now: At the top of the 4th, the New York Mets are 4, the Boston Red Sox, 1 [The President referred to the third game of the World Series].
But tonight we honor one of those foreign leaders who's been a joy to know; a man who has achieved great power and influence, yet has remained unpretentious and who, as Nancy would say, is just simply charming. Chancellor Kohl, as was reconfirmed in our meetings today, is a responsible leader who takes his work seriously; a man with confidence, because what he does is out of honest conviction.
A German philosopher, Heinrich Heine, once said, ""The worst poison is to despair of one's own power."" Well, despair is not in Chancellor Kohl's vocabulary. He sets his goals and goes about achieving them with great gusto. Chancellor Kohl is a realist, yet he has not lost touch with his ideals. Carl Schurz, born a German, an adopted American, a champion of human freedom, once wrote: ""Ideals are like the stars; we never reach them. But like the mariners of the sea, we chart our course by them."" Chancellor Kohl charts his course guided by the ideals of liberty and justice. This is the source of his sense of purpose, the source from which democracy draws its strength, a power beyond the reach of tyrants.
Today the Western democracies face challenges that, at times, seem overwhelming. Yet we persevere, and in the end, freedom will triumph. Our victory will not be realized in the crossing of borders by well-equipped armies, certainly not in the launching of missiles or the occupation of other countries. Our victory will come, perhaps little by little, as walls are torn down, missiles dismantled, and as people are freed. Free peoples everywhere share this vision. The friendship and comradery of Chancellor Kohl's visit is testimony that the world we seek is already being built.
In a few short years, the world will not only enter a new century but also a new millennium. And so I would ask you all to join me now in a toast to friends, close partners who are working with us to ensure that the time ahead will be an age of peace, prosperity, and freedom: To Chancellor Kohl and Mrs. Kohl and the German people.
The Chancellor. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it's a source of particular pleasure for my wife, my colleagues, and my delegation to be your guests here tonight. With warmth and elegance you, Mrs. Reagan, have extended to us such magnificent hospitality. And as always, we appreciate the cordiality of your welcome and the very friendly and intimate atmosphere that prevails here. And all those who have preserved for themselves a sense of history will certainly enjoy these hours here in this house.
Well, my last appointment before coming to this hospitable occasion here in the White House was meeting with Youth for Understanding. And there I met with young Germans who have come here to this country to spend 1 year in American families, and with young Americans who have just returned from Germany. And I feel, Mr. President, that both these occasions, my visit with Youth for Understanding and this dinner here tonight, go together and belong together.
This day, with the serious and important conversations we had when we tried to take stock after the Reykjavik conference, that what we are doing and what we are discussing is serving the purpose only for coming generations. And it is true in 14 years from now we arrive in the year 2000. This is a new century and will be a new millennium. And that is the reason why what we are doing now, what we start to set in motion, is so important for the young generation. And I consider it to be important to make a remark of that kind in this very house which has seen so many historic events and, over the last 100 years, also world historic events. And it is important for my fellow countrymen, Mr. President, in Germany-in both parts of Germany—it is important for them to know that we have friends here in this country—we, as Germans. And they should know that we in Germany can rely on those friends. This is a solid friendship, and this friendship is based on shared ideals and values. And I think this is more important and matters more than anything else. Because material conditions may change, but when we continue to share the same values, then we will also have a common future.
And I would like to thank you once again, as I have done already today, for having seized this opportunity in Reykjavik. And both of us are without any illusion. We know with whom we are talking. But we know that these talks are necessary and that, in reality, there is no alternative to these talks and that the time has now come to get over this watershed, as [Secretary of State] George Shultz has put it—there, where you can take the responsibility for it, with a sense of realism, but also with a sense of courage. And I'm saying this as a German, a German who lives, more than a national of another country, in the shadow of the dividing line between East and West. And I'm making these remarks as somebody who knows that peace and freedom cannot be had for nothing and as somebody who is asking for greater sacrifices from the young generation of his own country than perhaps in other countries. We have just extended the term of the draft. But we have done it because we are aware of the fact that freedom and peace are inseparably linked up with one another.
Mr. President, we had good talks. And I think I may say, with your permission, what characterizes and what is best in our talks is that we don't make so many words to make ourselves understood to each other. World statisticians who are looking into a good many things claim that in 1953, when Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, paid his first visit to the United States of America, had spoken during various addresses and statements a total of 288,000 words. At that time, we didn't have computers yet- [laughter] —and I think nobody checked on that figure. But it sounds well. We required fewer words today, because it was not necessary to us to make ourselves understood. And this, Mr. President, I think is a good omen, and I hope things will stay like this. You may rely on your friends in Germany as we—and I myself, personally—have gone through the experience that we may rely and count on you.
I should now like to propose a toast: To your good health, Mr. President; to your good health, Mrs. Reagan; and to a prosperous future of the great American Nation, the great Americans, our friends.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"October 16, 1997","
Mr. President, Zulema, to the members of Congress and the Supreme Court, Mr. Mayor and governors, former President Alfonsin, members of the diplomatic corps, distinguished guests. Mr. President, thank you for your fine statement, your warm welcome, and the extraordinary hospitality that Hillary and I and our entire delegation of Cabinet, administration, and congressional members have received from the people of Buenos Aires and Argentina.
Mr. President, as you know, like you, I come from a small rural State, where some people still value their horse more than their automobile. [Laughter] And with this remarkable feast, you have reminded us with barbecue that we are truly at home.
Exactly 150 years ago, in the autumn of 1847, a young man from Argentina visited the United States and was profoundly affected by the experience. He thought that we Americans ate our meals too quickly—[laughter]—that our young people had strange courtship habits, and that the White House was not big enough for the President. [Laughter] Still, he was impressed by a nation in which individuals were valued for their capacity and their work, where education was prized as the great equalizing force of democracy, where a multitude of people of different backgrounds and languages came together, in his words, ""as if they were one family, joining one another, mixing with each other, parts of old societies forming the new, most daring republic in the world."" Mr. President, that young man was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.
Today, 150 years later, America looks across the great expanse of our hemisphere at Argentina and we are inspired by Argentina today as Sarmiento was by America then. We see a nation shaped, like us, by waves of immigrants from the Old World and the experience of frontier life in the New World. Here, where so many languages are spoken, from Basque to Ukrainian, from Arabic to Welsh, we see a nation drawing strength from its remarkable diversity. Today, we see an Argentina grounded in democracy, committed to economic reforms that have put it on the road to more widespread prosperity and to educating its people for the demands of the new economy.
I speak for all Americans when I say how very pleased I am that in the last decade our nations have built a strong, new relationship, driven by shared values, based on partnership and respect. Argentina and America have joined together in common cause. We pledge to create a free-trade area of the Americas by 2005; to bring new prosperity to all people of our hemisphere; to turn the revolution in information technology to our children's advantage by opening a world of knowledge to all—all—our children. One hundred fifty years ago, education was Sarmiento's great passion. Today, it is central to our ability to prove that democracy works for all people and to the future we are trying to build together.
We are also partners in helping those around the world who take risks for peace. I thank the people of Argentina for sending peacekeepers into troubled places all over the Earth and setting an example for all nations. The robust bonds of friendship between Argentina and the United States are rooted in our shared commitment to peace and freedom, to prosperity and security, to the integrity of the individual, the family, and the community. They are at the heart of all we dream for our future.
President Menem, I salute you for the extraordinary leadership you have shown in helping our nations turn this corner in history. No one in our hemisphere has done more to seize the opportunities of this new era. Generations to come will remember this as a moment when our two nations served the deepest interests of our people. And tonight the United States is proud to work alongside Argentina, an Argentina that is fulfilling Domingo Sarmiento's greatest hopes.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us raise a glass to the new partnership between our people for peace and prosperity, here and throughout the world.
"
state-dinners,Donald J. Trump,"April 24, 2018","
President Trump. President Macron, Brigitte, Melania and I are profoundly honored to host you and your entire French delegation for our first official state dinner. And to America's absolutely incredible First Lady, thank you for making this an evening we will always cherish and remember. Thank you, Melania.
Tonight we celebrate nearly two-and-half centuries of friendship between the United States and France. Yesterday we had a wonderful visit to Mount Vernon, a place that is truly special in the history of this very remarkable friendship. It was there that General George Washington met with General Rochambeau to finalize battle plans for victory at Yorktown. Many, many victories. It was there, after the war, that General Lafayette returned to visit his adoptive father, George Washington. Lafayette named his only son after Washington as a tribute to respect and love for his dear friend.
And there, at Mount Vernon, hanging on the wall for all to see, is the key to the Bastille, a gift from Lafayette to Washington. This tool of imprisonment had become a symbol of liberty, the desire for freedom that burns brightly in the heart of every French and American patriot.
This is the divine flame, which Victor Hugo wrote that ""evil can never wholly extinguish,"" and which ""good can make to glow with splendor."" This is the flame that spurred American soldiers to join the French on the battlefields of World War I. This is the ""Flame of French Resistance"" of which Charles de Gaulle rallied his country in 1940. More than a million Frenchmen took up arms to defeat fascism in World War II. And this is the conviction that unites the French and American soul as we work together every day to build a future that is more just, prosperous, and free.
The veins that link our nations are forged in battle, strengthened through trial, and defined by the timeless principles that make us who and what we are: respect for life, love for our neighbors, pride in our traditions, defense of our heritage, and reverence for the rights bestowed on us through grace and the glory of God.
So tonight I ask that we raise our glasses as I offer this toast to President Macron and Brigitte, to the French delegation, and to every proud citizen of France. May our friendship grow even deeper, may our kinship grow even stronger, and may our sacred liberty never die.
God bless you, God bless France, God bless our alliance, and God bless America. Thank you, Mr. President.
[At this point, President Trump offered a toast.]
President Macron. Mr. President, dear Donald, Madam First Lady, dear Melania, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: It is an honor for Brigitte and me to be here with you in this legendary place, the White House, for this sumptuous dinner surrounded by friends of France that you were so kind to invite.
This White House, so full of history, that the British burned down in 1815—and I say this in the most amicable way—and that James Monroe then had the brilliant idea of decorating with French furniture—[laughter]—a man of taste. In fact, he was a former Ambassador to Paris. I want to thank you, dear Melania, to paying tribute to this joint history, thanks to the gift you kindly gave us this morning.
Mr. President, you just reminded us, like we did earlier this morning, how deep, how strong, and how intense the relationship is between our two countries. This relationship, from the very beginning, is rooted in the revolution that saw the birth of the United States of America and the revolution that freed us, all along our joint history, through the wars that we have led together for freedom and to defend our value; this relationship, which is based on all of our values.
And tonight my thoughts go to the young Lafayette who came to risk his life because of his love for freedom. And my thoughts also go to the tens of thousands of American soldiers, young soldiers, who gave their lives during World War I and World War II on a soil which was not theirs, but for this freedom which they cherished and which was theirs.
We have always been there for the appointments of this joint history. And this is the reason why today we have no alternative but to be there also for an appointment with history. There is a joint willingness on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to build our countries, to make them stronger—greater, you would say—and more solid. But let us now forget that our task, accordingly, is to always be more ambitious. Our task, at the head of the United States and at the head of France, is always about the statute of universality for which so many generations sacrificed themselves.
These values that we support, ladies and gentlemen, you very much represent them—you who are here with us tonight—be it in the field of culture, science, sport, the economic life, the political life, or diplomacy. There is always this little extra which you represent, because you're French, because you're American.
This is the reason why, Mr. President, we decided to work together for both our countries and also because this duty is about something that goes beyond us. And this is also the reason why our military took legitimate action a few days ago. This is also the reason why we will work for stability and to preserve our values. This is, Mr. President, the only way we both have to deal with history that goes beyond us, the duty that is ours. And many comment on our friendship, but I think it only helps us work together towards these goals.
On both sides of the ocean, some 2 years ago, very few would have bet on us being here together today. But as a matter of fact, we share the same determination and the willingness to serve both our countries—your country, my country—and the rest of the world. I got to know you; you got to know me. We both know that none of us easily changes his mind. But we will work together, and we have this ability to listen to one another. This is the reason why our relationship will serve our strong history. And we are also aware of the challenges ahead of us, but we will keep working together. And for the quality of our exchanges, I would like to thank you for this, as well as for your invitation.
Mr. President, dear Donald, dear Melania: Thank you. Thank you for honoring France, for honoring me and Brigitte and the French delegation with this first state visit, which is commensurate to the quality and the level of the bonds between our two countries.
And in turn, please allow me to raise my glass. Please allow me to raise my glass to all our fellow citizens on both sides of the ocean who fought for our values. Please allow me to raise my glass. We have to be up to the debt and to their—that we owe them and up to their sacrifice. Please allow me to raise my glass to the friendship, the unbreakable friendship, between France and the United States. [President Macron offered a toast.]
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"September 10, 1986","
President Reagan. President Sarney, distinguished guests, it's a pleasure to have you here tonight. Our meetings today were businesslike and productive. The spirit of amicability and good will that were so evident throughout our sessions bodes well for the future. One of the benefits of such meetings, as we had today, is that they provide the opportunity for leaders to get to know each other. And in this case it was a delight. President Sarney is the leader of a great nation, sophisticated in the ways of politics and economics, yet a person with the heart of a poet—truly a Renaissance man.
Having been in the profession I was in for a good part of my life, it's an honor to have here this evening an individual whose interests lie not just with politics but also the arts. We believe in freedom not only because it reflects the most moral system of human interaction, not only because it leads to economic progress but also because it nourishes the artistic and creative spirit of man. President Sarney has said, ""Literature and politics are inspired in the conscience of liberty."" When one thinks of Brazil, it's difficult not to hear the sounds of music or the sight of joyous dance. Of course, Brazil is much more than that—and the sounds of construction and building are clearly evident today.
And after speaking with President Sarney, one cannot doubt that the richness of Brazil's soul is alive and well. President Sarney has faced great challenges since his first day as President. Following the tragic death of Dr. Tancredo Neves—a powerful event in the life of your nation—your countrymen and, yes, the rest of the world looked to you. Even in the best of circumstances, this would have been an awesome responsibility during this time of great transition. It required a truly remarkable leader, a man of vision and principle. President Sarney, I'm certain that you agree that, on occasion, the magnitude of problems faced by a head of state seem a bit overwhelming. If you'll permit an informal American expression on such a formal occasion, I usually put it this way: When you're up to your neck in alligators, it's hard to remember your original purpose was to drain the swamp. [Laughter]
Yet a true leader is one who does not lose sight of goals and ideals. He keeps the spirit of his people high and the course set in the right direction. And tonight we honor just such a leader. With exceptional diligence and strength of purpose, you are bringing your country, your beloved Brazil, into a new era of prosperity and freedom. Ruy Barbosa, a prominent Brazilian statesman and intellectual at the turn of the century, once said: ""Some sow their cabbage patch merely for tomorrow's meal. Others plant an oak tree as a shelter for the future. While the first dig for themselves, the others plow for their country, for the happiness of their descendants, for the well-being of mankind.""
President Sarney, let us pledge that the American and Brazilian people will plant oaks for a better tomorrow, and that they will do it together. And now, would you all join me in a toast to President Sarney and the people of Brazil.
President Sarney. Mr. President, Mrs. Nancy Reagan, as this will be our last opportunity on this trip to be together, I think it is a time for gratitude, a time to convey our thanks for the warmth, the hospitality, the kindness, and the spirit of friendship that has pervaded this stay. During dinner, the lady I was sitting next to told me of the American habit of making a wish when you see the first star. There is only one star that I can see up there in the sky tonight, so I think that we should all perhaps share the same wish—the wish for a permanent friendship between our two countries.
We've had many proofs of the kindness of the President of the United States. But we did not expect his esteem and kindness to extend as far as providing us with this unforgettable evening and a sky with one star and no clouds. When arriving here this evening, Mrs. Reagan pointed to the Moon, and I thought to myself, I've seen that girl somewhere before. It was two evenings ago in Brasilia. And again, that is a symbol that we share. And I repeat what I said this morning—two souls, one feeling.
You spoke of alligators, Mr. President. In Brazil, we have piranhas, and we also have a saying: ""In times of strain and difficulties, when swimming in rivers full of piranhas, the only way is to play alligator and turn on your back."" [Laughter]
I am deeply moved, Mr. President, by your kind remarks that reflect the spirit of friendship and cordiality of this memorable visit to Washington. And I think this reception this evening is the crowning achievement of this visit and this feeling of friendship and cooperation. I will never forget your words, I will never forget this evening—the friendship of this memorable visit to the United States and Washington. I have brought word of a country, Brazil, a country in transition, setting out to answer its most noble historic calling—to be a full democracy in which political freedom is reflected in the economic and social life of the nation. The United States is the land where freedom and the participation of the people have brought forth the most extraordinary material and social progress in history, an example to be always pursued. During our meeting with you, Mr. President, I found a partner willing to listen in an open and interested manner, and I'm quite certain that this will lead to further improvement in the longstanding and permanent friendship between our countries.
Your talent for imprinting your personal and decisive stamp on the form and substance of the Presidency and on the very history of the United States is surely an unmistakable demonstration of your statesmanship, which the people of the United States have overwhelmingly acclaimed. And I would say it in a far more eloquent fashion if I didn't have to lose so much time with the translation. [Laughter] This is a moment of friendly celebration marked by the warm hospitality extended us by our gracious American hosts. May I also, on behalf of Marly and on my own behalf, pay tribute in the name of the Brazilian people to Mrs. Nancy Reagan for her tireless work and efforts on behalf of the young. Mrs. Reagan has met with the admiration and the solidarity of the entire Brazilian people. And since I have come to the United States, I have become more aware, perhaps, of another contribution given by Mrs. Reagan to all mankind—the example she has set of love, as sharing of love as an expression of solidarity. The love of a wife for her husband is an example to all mankind.
In closing, Mr. President, because afterdinner speeches are always too long, no matter how short, may I, in this Rose Garden, propose a toast and ask you to join me in toasting the longstanding friendship between people of Brazil and the United States, the greatness and prosperity of the United States of America, and to your own personal success and happiness and that of Mrs. Reagan. God save America!

Buenas noches. President Pinera; First Lady; former Presidents Aylwin, Frei, Lagos; to all the distinguished guests here tonight, especially the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Jose Miguel Insulza: It is wonderful to be here. I have to say that because I've already given one speech tonight, I've already made remarks at the press, I'm going to keep my remarks tonight very brief. Because otherwise, you won't invite me back. [Laughter]
On our flight into Chile today, we were all struck by the incredible beauty of the Andes. We looked out the window, Michelle and my daughters and my staff, and we marveled at the awesome ranges and the snowcapped peaks. It was truly spectacular.
And it called to mind something once said by a beloved daughter of both our countries, the novelist Isabel Allende. She said, ""I come from a land of mountains, where friendship is a blood pact . . . hospitality is sacred, [and] bonds unbreakable.""
President Pinera, First Lady, to you and the people of Santiago and of Chile, thank you for the extraordinary hospitality that you have shown to both me, Michelle, and our daughters. And thank you for the friendship and the strong bonds between our people, which indeed are unbreakable.
Given the events that are unfolding half a world away, in the Middle East and North Africa, I hope you'll give me a brief moment to reflect on the broader meaning of the times that we live in.
We gather in a palace that tells the story of a nation and its relationship with my own. For many years, this was a symbol of how Chile lost its democracy. But today, it stands as a testament to how Chile regained and rebuilt your democracy, an achievement for which I know all Chileans are extraordinarily proud.
In this sense, you've fulfilled the vision of the liberator Bolivar, who long ago predicted, ""Chile can be free."" Chile can be free. And as I said in my speech today, at a time when others around the world are reaching for their own rights and struggling for their own sense of dignity, Chile sends a powerful message: You too can write a new chapter in the story of your nation; you too can be free.
Some have called Chile's progress a miracle. But as you know so well, there was nothing miraculous about it. It takes courage and sacrifice and resolve over many years. This too is Chile's lesson for the world. Democracy can't be imposed from the outside. It must spring from within, from the hearts and souls of those who seek it and are willing to work for it.
There's a saying that goes, ""Tell me who is by your side, and I'll tell you who you are."" And so I would like to propose a toast. I hope they didn't mix up our glasses. [Laughter].
To the people and progress of Chile, the United States of America is proud to stand with you as partners. And to what our partnership says about who we are, two proud nations bound by the conviction that change is possible, that every nation can be free, and that there can be no denying the dignity and human rights that are so eloquently expressed in our Constitution and are now lived out in Chile today.
Salud.

Buenas noches. President Funes, First Lady, former Presidents Cristiani and Saca, distinguished guests, on behalf of Michelle and our daughters, thank you for the wonderful hospitality that's been shown to us here in San Salvador.
As many of you know, this has been my first trip through Latin America as President, and this is our final night. We are closer to home. I mean this in more than just a geographical sense. El Salvador is one of those places where the bonds between the United States and Latin America are strongest.
Just about every Salvadoran has a loved one or a friend in the United States--husbands and sons, mothers and daughters--working hard, sacrificing every day. They strengthen my country, and they mean so much to El Salvador. They're very much in our thoughts tonight.
In my speech in Santiago yesterday, I said that Latin America is not the stereotype of a region in perpetual conflict or trapped in an endless cycle of poverty. I repeat that tonight because many look at a country like El Salvador and only see the struggles. I'm proud to work with President Funes, a courageous leader, to meet those challenges together as partners.
But I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the side of this nation that is too often overlooked, which is just as real and just as important. It's the El Salvador that endures, even when the earth shakes and the floodwaters rise, because Salvadorans are people who persevere.
It's the El Salvador that has struggled for justice and human rights. And along with President Funes, I was honored to visit the cathedral this evening and pay my respects to Archbishop Romero, who remains an inspiration to people all around the world. And I see the current archbishop here. We're very grateful for the wonderful tour that you offered.
It's the El Salvador that not only forged historic accords, but has sustained them for nearly two decades, proving, in the words of your national anthem, that ""happiness is found in peace.""
And it's the El Salvador that gets up every day and goes to work--students, merchants, farmers, young entrepreneurs, businesspeople--who remind us that building a just and prosperous future cannot be the work of government alone; it must be the responsibility of all--of all--who love their countries.
Of peace enjoyed in perfect happinessEl Salvador always nobly dreamed,To achieve this has been Her eternal struggle,To keep it, Her greatest glory.
With these words, I'd like to propose a toast, if I can get a glass. [Laughter] To President Funes and the First Lady, for their outstanding hospitality and friendship, and to the peace and happiness that we seek: for our peoples, for the region, and for the world. May we not only achieve our dreams, may we keep them for this and for generations yet to come.
Salud.

Your Excellencies, welcome to the United States. Welcome to the White House. And welcome to the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy.
I do want to begin my remarks by extending our heartfelt sympathies and prayers to Prime Minister Balkenende. He landed today and called me on the phone to inform me that his father had passed away. He returned back to his country to be with his family, and we wish them all the very best.
In the State Dining Room tonight are representatives of major industrialized economies, some of the largest developing economies, and key international financial institutions. We are here because we share a concern about the impact of the global financial crisis on the people of our nations. We share a determination to fix the problems that led to this turmoil. We share a conviction that by working together, we can restore the global economy to the path of long-term prosperity.
When we sit down at the summit table tomorrow, we bring clear priorities. Tomorrow's discussion will be the first in a series of meetings. We will focus on key, five objectives: understanding the causes of the global crisis, reviewing the effectiveness of our responses thus far, identifying principles for reforming our financial and regulatory systems, launching a specific action plan to implement those principles, and reaffirming our conviction that free market principles offer the surest path to lasting prosperity.
As we pursue these objectives, we can build on what we have achieved together so far. Since the outbreak of the crisis, the world's leading nations have coordinated our actions more closely than ever before. Thanks in large part to these decisive measures, global credit markets are beginning to thaw. Businesses around the world are regaining access to essential short-term financing, and stability is beginning to return to the international financial system. This problem did not develop overnight, and it will not be solved overnight. But with continued cooperation and determination, it will be solved.
There is more work to do beyond the immediate crisis, and the stakes are indeed high. Billions of hard-working people are counting on us to strengthen our financial systems for the long term. Families need credit to buy homes and to fund education. Businesses need capital to expand their operations so they can hire new employees. Older workers are counting on pensions and retirement funds to support them in their retirement years. Developing nations need the assistance they have been promised, as well as additional foreign investment, to continue their journey from poverty to promise. All over the world, people understand that their livelihoods depend upon a healthy and growing global economy.
The surest path to that growth is to continue policies of free and open markets. Free market capitalism has been an engine of prosperity, progress, and social mobility in economies all over the globe. Trade and investment have been—have linked our economies together, creating new customers for businesses and workers and greater choices and lower prices for consumers. All our nations must reject calls for protectionism, collectivism, and defeatism in the face of our current challenge.
I thank you all for coming and for your commitment to this urgent work. And with confidence in the success of our efforts, I offer a toast to all of you, to the principles we share, and to the people we serve.

Mr. President and Madam Kwasniewski, Mr. Prime Minister and Madam Buzek, distinguished guests, many of whom sacrificed for freedom. Laura and I are grateful for this great day—it's been a great day in Poland—and for this good company. You've made us feel most welcome.
I bring with me the affectionate greetings of the American people. Poland has a special place in our hearts, not just in places like Panna Maria, Texas, or Warsaw, Alabama, or Pulaski, Tennessee. Americans understand that we owe a lot to Poland. It has even been claimed that the old Polish game—an old Polish game was the earliest inspiration for baseball. [Laughter] If that's true, I owe more than most. [Laughter]
Today, our friendship is based upon a shared heritage and a hope for the future. When my father came to Warsaw in 1989, he declared that the cold war that began in Poland could end in Poland. Poles won their freedom with courage and determination. Americans from President Reagan to President Bush to President Clinton walked alongside you. Hope became reality. And Poland knows that when that happened, the world turned right side up. Poland became a mature democracy. Long a friend to America, we now proudly call you Ally. Yours is a moving story, and only you will ever know how difficult it was to write.
Mr. President, the United States greatly admires the leadership you have demonstrated these past 6 years. You understand that building a better future sometimes entails coming to grips with the past, even if that past is uncomfortable to some. America understands the value of reconciliation, of overcoming old divisions. History looks well upon such leadership.
Mr. Prime Minister, the United States is deeply appreciative of your service to your country and to the cause of freedom. You understand that building a better future requires hard choices. The reformer is rarely rewarded and often criticized but then moves ahead with reform, nonetheless. History is kind to this type of leader, as well.
This week I've spoken to many leaders from across Europe about the challenges of unity and open commerce and peace. I am here today because America is convinced that we can meet those challenges in partnership with a strong and free Poland. We know we can count on Poland to remain true to its best traditions of tolerance, compromise, and determination that have brought you so far and so fast.
We know we can count on Poland to keep reaching out to its neighbors, showing them the way and helping them help themselves. We know we can count on Poland to continue its reforms. And Poland can count on America. We are in Europe to stay, because we know the danger of retreating behind the false security of an ocean.
Together, our countries know what faith, commitment, and integrity can build. Our partnership is going to last a long time, always mindful of where we have been; always moving forward to build the future we know we want, the future we know we can achieve.
My toast is for a free Poland, its leadership, and the courageous souls who made it happen.
God bless.

President Reagan. Wendell Phillips once said that ""you can always get the truth from an American statesman after he has turned 70 or given up all hope of the Presidency."" [Laughter] Well, today I welcome you, President Mubarak, as a friend. Coming from a 76-year-old constitutionally prohibited from seeking another term, you can rest assured those sentiments are genuine and come from the heart. [Laughter]
This visit is a particularly happy occasion as it provides the opportunity to congratulate you personally on your reelection to a second term as President of Egypt. As a second term veteran myself, however, let me suggest, Mr. President, it doesn't get any easier. [Laughter] The referendum that approved your second term reflects the strong confidence that the Egyptian people have in your leadership. We share that same confidence. Nevertheless, Mr. President, we both know that governing a country in which there are divergent political views and a lively opposition is a tough job. We respect your work to broaden participation in the political process and are confident it will help create the stable political environment needed for Egypt to move forward.
Egypt today, under your guidance, is resuming its rightful place in the forefront of world leadership. This is particularly important at a time when the forces of fanaticism and blind hatred threaten the security and stability of the Middle East. Egypt, by again exerting its wise and calming influence, provides the world hope that the serious challenges facing the Middle East can and will be overcome and that the region will be restored to a happier and more tranquil course.
Likewise, President Mubarak, you have wisely and effectively led Egypt onto a course of economic reform and development. The difficult obstacles you and the Egyptian people face are well understood here, too. We, too, learned in our own efforts to strip away years of government intervention in our marketplace how monumental this task can be, how ingrained is the dependence on intervention, and how powerful are the interest groups that resist change. But we're convinced that such vigorous reform is the surest path to economic progress. And, Mr. President, Americans will stand and work with Egyptians in the cause of growing prosperity, just as we do in the cause of peace.
Mr. President, our meetings today were enjoyable and enlightening. And so, you are most welcome. And in saying that, I propose a toast to you, Mr. President, Mrs. Mubarak, the people of Egypt, and to the close and amicable ties that will continue between our peoples and our governments.
President Mubarak. President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, dear friends, thank you for your kind words and the gracious hospitality. The elegant and warm reception you have accorded us reflects the best tradition of American friendship and genuine openness. It is a tradition that has deep roots in our culture, too. We value friendship and loyalty to friends. As usual, President Reagan and his graceful spouse have made us feel welcome and quite at home the minute we arrived at the White House this morning. They symbolize the American spirit at its best.
My meeting with the President today was another confirmation of my belief that he is a man of wisdom and vision. He is an American in the true sense of the word. I expressed to him my admiration of the relentless efforts he exerted for years to make the world more safe and secure for future generations. His recent achievement in this area will certainly have a lasting effect on world peace and stability. I have no doubt that other steps will follow in the same direction during the months ahead.
I am certain that regional conflicts will figure high on the agenda throughout the year. Of these conflicts, the Middle East problems deserve special attention and priority. Strenuous efforts are needed to stop the war, which is still raging in the Gulf, and set the peace process in motion again. We have to demonstrate to all the parts concerned that peace is the only meaningful and effective way to settle disputes and solve problems. No other formula would work. No other alternative is acceptable. There is no justification at all for the continuation of bloodshed and destruction. As Benjamin Franklin once said: ""There never was a good war or a bad peace.""
With this in mind, Egypt has not hesitated at any point to take pioneering steps in order to make peace. It is for this reason, too, that I have proposed a few days ago a moratorium on all forms of violence and repression. I am quite convinced that this proposal, which is conceived as a preparatory step towards comprehensive peace, reflects the real sentiment of people of good will and human principles everywhere. No one who looks ahead and thinks of the future can accept the continuation of occupation and oppression. No one can, in good conscience, condone a policy of shooting and beating in a land that is holy to all of us.
What I am proposing here is a policy of hope and positivity to replace despair and fear. I am sure that I am not alone in that, for I am backed by millions of men and women of courage and conviction everywhere. Let me seize this opportunity to thank all those Americans, Israelis, and others who raise their voices in support of peace and in defense of liberty. Their stand will never go unnoticed or unrewarded.
Dear friends, American leaders have worked with Egyptian leaders over the years in order to construct a model for friendship and cooperation among nations. In particular, President Reagan has made a great contribution to the development of friendly relations between Egypt and the United States. We are proud of this friendship, which has been mature enough to overcome all obstacles we have encountered and deep enough to look to the future with hope and promise. The talks we had in the morning added to the reservoir of good will and mutual understanding that exists today between our peoples. As ever, the President was both receptive and responsive. I highly value his opinions and ideas. We shall continue to work together, as we did in the past, in order to serve our common goal of reinforcing peace and promoting progress and stability.
In conclusion, permit me to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to rise in a tribute to President and Mrs. Reagan, to all our friends who are present this evening, and each and every American. Thank you.

General Franco, Mrs. Franco, Your Excellencies, friends of Spain and the United States:
When I visited President Eisenhower just a few weeks before he died, he was reminiscing about his great experiences as president and also as a military leader. I asked him to weigh the various receptions that he had had around the world. He thought a moment and then he said that one of the greatest and most friendly welcomes and the most memorable receptions he had as President of the United States was a reception in Spain in 1959, when he was the guest at this table and in this city of you, General Franco, and Mrs. Franco.
I now know what he meant, because today we had the opportunity to feel the kind of reception that the Spanish people, under your leadership, gave to him and that you gave to us, as representatives of the American people. We think of this magnificent banquet, at the very table where he sat just 11 years ago, with many of the same people here present.
We think of the words of welcome which you have so generously spoken. We think also, of the tremendous crowds in the streets of Madrid as we drove together to the Palace where we are staying.
And as we heard and saw those crowds, they were saying many things. Among them were these: First, General Franco, they were expressing their respect and their affection for you. Second, they were expressing their friendship for the people of the United States.
Third, as I saw those crowds, I saw the past of Spain and the future of Spain, and it is truly a great future, because I saw a vigorous people--a proud people, a young people, a dynamic people--the people that have been responsible for Spain having the fastest growth rate of any country in Europe over these past to years; the people who will be responsible for Spain, in the last 30 years of this century, moving into a new period of economic progress and well-being for its people and a new period of contributions to progress for all peoples in the world.
This is what I felt as we drove through the streets of Madrid today.
And then in the talks that we have had this afternoon with you, with members of your staff, with Vice President Blanco, with Prince Juan Carlos, with Secretary Bravo,1 I felt that we, in those talks, established a new firm base for increased understanding, increased cooperation in all fields between Spain and the United States in the years ahead.
We have been good friends, our two countries. We, I believe, in the years ahead can be even better friends.
The treaty to which you have referred can be the solid basis for areas of cooperation that have not yet been explored, and we want to participate with you in this great adventure in which the Spanish people, with a proud past, move forward to one of the great periods in its entire history in the last 30 years of this century.
I would say to you finally, that as I heard the crowds in the streets today, I realized that the United States has many friends in Spain.
I want to assure you, General Franco, the members of your Government, and all of this distinguished company here, and all those who may hear me on television or radio, that Spain has many friends in the United States. And I assure you, particularly, that Spain has two special friends, the present President of the United States and his wife, who have a feeling of affection and of friendship for this country, for its people.
You will always have a friend in us and a good friend and a loyal friend in the years ahead.
So I ask this company to rise with me and raise your glasses to the health of General Franco and Mrs. Franco, to the economic progress and prosperity of the Spanish people, and to the cooperation of the United States and Spain in the cause of peace and progress for the whole world.
General Franco.

The President. Good evening. President Kim, Mrs. Kim, members of the Korean delegation, distinguished guests, Hillary and I welcome you to the White House.
On our two trips to Korea, we experienced the great kindness of the Korean people. We hope you have experienced that same feeling from the American people.
As you can see from looking around this room, the American people include more than 1 million Korean-Americans who make very strong contributions to the United States but never forget their brothers and sisters half a world away.
Mr. President, I hope you consider America your second home. I recall very well the day in 1992 we first met on the steps of the City Hall in Los Angeles, where we also met with citizens who were starting to rebuild their community after intense racial strife.
You spent much of your period of exile in our country, and you have many great friends here, some of whom are with us tonight. They have stood by you through times of trouble, and in turn, you have been a real inspiration to them.
In one of the many letters to your family from your prison cell, you recalled an old adage: Even if the heavens were to crash down, there is a hole through which to rise up; and even if taken in a tiger's teeth, there is a way to survive.
Mr. President, the story of your way is almost unbelievable: Raised on an island with no paved roads or electricity, you were captured by the North Koreans in the war and nearly executed; elected to the national assembly only days before the assembly was disbanded by a coup; denied the Presidency in 1971 after voter intimidation and fraud by the ruling party; injured when a 14-ton truck tried to ram your car; kidnapped, taken to sea, prepared for drowning by Government agents; sentenced to death again in 1981 after a 6-minute trial. Through it all, you never lost hope that democracy and human rights could rise up in your beloved land.
Now you are at the center of that democracy working to make the dreams of your people a reality. You are an inspiration, not only to your fellow Koreans but to people all around the world who seek freedom and a better life. Tonight we celebrate your triumphs and the triumph of democracy in so many nations that once were ruled by the iron hand of dictatorship. We also remember with gratitude those who bravely struggled for freedom but gave their lives before their dreams were realized. And we honor those around the world who still struggle to free their countries from tyranny. Their struggles and yours, Mr. President, remind us that we must never take freedom for granted.
As Abraham Lincoln, whose life and words you have studied, once said, ""The fight must go on. The cause of liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one, or even 100 defeats."" Mr. President, you remind us that, at the end of all the defeats and all the trials, there is victory for the human spirit.
Therefore, it is a great honor for me to ask all of you to join in a toast to President Kim, Mrs. Kim, the people of the Republic of Korea, the deep friendship between our nations, and the brilliant future for Korea that you will build.
[At this point, a toast was offered, and President Kim made brief remarks.]
The President. Mr. President, thank you.

Welcome. Madam President, Attorney Arroyo, it is a high honor for Laura and me to welcome you and host you at the White House. Madam President, I know you attended college here in Washington, so perhaps I ought to say welcome back or, as they say at Georgetown, Hoya Saxa. [Laughter]
With your visit, the Philippines and the United States affirm our strong friendship, our common commitment to fighting terror, and our shared determination to promote freedom.
Our nations are natural partners. We are connected by an ocean, united by a shared history, and sustained by the bonds of family and culture. More than 2 million Americans have family ties to the Philippines. And some are with us tonight, and you're welcome. Filipino Americans strengthen America's culture, our economy, and our Government. And we are privileged that they call this country their home.
The United States and the Philippines are also joined by common values, especially the value of human freedom. And when freedom comes under attack, our countries respond.
Madam President, you've been a fierce fighter of terrorism in your own country. You've earned the respect of the American people for your resolve. And after September the 11th, you were one of the first leaders to contact me and express your strong support for the war against terror, and you have not wavered.
The President was also a strong and persuasive voice on the need to disarm Saddam Hussein and to liberate the Iraqi people.
Madam President, for your leadership and for your friendship, I thank you.
Seventeen years ago, the Filipino people restored their nation's democratic tradition and inspired lovers of freedom across the globe. In the years since, the Philippines has emerged as a stronger and more confident nation. The Philippines is building its prosperity on the foundation of markets and building its future on a foundation of democracy. These commitments are opening new opportunities for the Filipino people and setting a hopeful example for other nations traveling the road to freedom.
President Arroyo is playing a large role in her nation's success. Her bold and determined leadership has opened a new chapter in the friendship between our countries and is responsible for revitalizing our strong alliance.
In his last poem, Jose Rizal, one of the founders of the Filipino independence, referred to his native land as the ""Pearl of the Orient Seas."" More than a century later, this ""pearl"" is admired the world over for its beauty, its progress, and its wonderful people.
Madam President, it will be my pleasure to visit the Philippines later this year, with you as my host. And Laura and I and the American people are honored to have you and your husband as our guests here tonight. Would you please join me in a toast to the enduring friendship between the Philippines and the United States.

President Obama. Good evening, everyone. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. And welcome to this very special dinner as we celebrate the great ties and longstanding friendship between the United States and our five Nordic partners.
Please join me in welcoming President Niinistö and Mrs. Haukio of Finland, Prime Minister Solberg and Mr. Finnes of Norway, Prime Minister and Mrs. Löfven of Sweden, Prime Minister and Mrs. Rasmussen of Denmark, and Prime Minister Jóhannsson and Mrs. Ingjaldsdóttir of Iceland.
Now, we all know that our Nordic friends share a pride in their common Viking heritage. But I think we can all admit that the Vikings could be a little rough. [Laughter] They didn't always have the best manners at the dining table. [Laughter] Their outfits were not always appropriate. [Laughter] But times have changed, and tonight our Nordic friends are much better behaved. [Laughter] We are honored to have you here. And as you can see from our decor, winter is coming. [Laughter]
This evening we have three toasts. So I'm going to be brief. And I don't want things to get out of hand. One of the great Old Norse poems, the Hávamál from Iceland, offered advice on how to welcome a guest, sort of like a Miss Manners for Vikings. [Laughter]
Less good than they say for the sons of men
Is the drinking oft of ale
For the more they drink the less they can think
And keep a watch o'ver their wits. [Laughter]
Good advice. It's perhaps easier said than done. It is true that our Nordic friends have a reputation today, unlike the past, for modesty and propriety. But don't let them fool you. In these Nordic countries, things actually can get a little wild. I understand that in Norway, for example, one of the big hits on TV is—[laughter]—""National Firewood Night."" [Laughter] This is true. A video of logs burning for hours—[laughter]—and hours and hours. That's crazy. [Laughter] Another show involved a video camera being strapped to the front of a train, so viewers could watch the rails for 7 hours. [Laughter] This sounds like riveting entertainment. [Laughter]
So we're not going to do anything that crazy tonight. [Laughter] But we are grateful for our friendship with the Nordic peoples, even if we do sometimes get a little jealous about how perfect they seem to be.
If you've visited any of these Nordic countries, everything is orderly. Everything is clean. Everybody is well behaved. It even prompted a best selling book called ""The Almost Nearly Perfect People."" But there were some shockers. Apparently, Nordic countries can sometimes get into heated arguments about which country is happiest. [Laughter] They also do get into arguments about who has the better hockey players, until America steals them away. [Laughter] And they also have arguments about who has the honor of being the true hometown of Santa Claus. So these are fierce debates that take place among our Nordic friends. [Laughter]
But our work today actually does remind us of why we so value our Nordic partners so much. In each other, we find those who we work with in pursuit of common values that we cherish the most. We stand together so that citizens can live in security and peace. We labor so our economies can create opportunity where prosperity goes not just to the top, but to the many. Together, we're on the forefront of the fight against climate change, to preserve our glaciers, our fjords, to protect indigenous peoples of the Arctic. And in our own countries and around the world, we stand for the dignity and equality of all people.
And many of our Nordic friends are familiar with the great Danish pastor and philosopher Grundtvig. And among other causes, he championed the idea of the folk school: education that was not just made available to the elite, but to the many; training that prepared a person for active citizenship that improves society. Over time, the folk school movement spread, including here to the United States. And one of those schools was in the State of Tennessee; it was called the Highlander Folk School.
At Highlander, especially during the 1950s, a new generation of Americans came together to share their ideas and strategies for advancing civil rights, for advancing equality, and for advancing justice. We know the names of some of those who were trained or participated in the Highlander School: Ralph Abernathy, John Lewis, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They were all shaped, in part, by Highlander and the teachings of a great Nordic philosopher. And they ended up having a ripple effect on the civil rights movement and ultimately on making America a better place. We would not have been here had it not been for that stone that was thrown in a lake and created ripples of hope that ultimately spread across an ocean to the United States of America. And I might not be standing here were it not for the efforts of people like Ella Baker and others who participated in the Highlander Folk School.
So that's just one small measure of the enormous positive influence that our Nordic friends have had on our country. It's part of the reason why we so value their friendship. I've said before—and I will repeat—they punch above their weight. And their values, their contributions not just to making their own countries function well, but making the whole world a better place makes them one of our most valuable partners everywhere in the world. And we are very grateful for the outstanding work that they do.
So I propose a toast: To the friendship between us and the values that we share. May our nations keep standing together and bending that arc of the moral universe in the direction of justice and peace and equality for all. Skål! Cheers!
[At this point, the President offered a toast.]
And with that, I want to welcome Prime Minister Jóhannsson of Iceland, to be followed by Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark.
Prime Minister Jóhannsson. Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, let me begin by expressing my pleasure of being here tonight, for your gracious hosting of the Nordic leaders and for the warm welcome you have extended to Iceland. We are honored to be here as allies, as partners, and most importantly, as friends of the United States. We bring with us the warm greetings and good wishes of our people. Relations between Iceland and the United States have always been strong. Our initial and ongoing defense partnership has blossomed into a broad friendship that includes deep commercial, academic, and cultural ties. And yes, that does sometimes include artists in swan dresses. [Laughter]
Our friendship is based on solidarity and cooperation on some of today's most complex problems. Building on our 2013 meeting in Stockholm at today's summit, I am pleased, we have recognized the excellent Nordic-U.S. cooperation and shared achievements. I'm also pleased that we have committed in our joint statement to further deepen and broaden our cooperation on several key international issues.
Our world views and interests align. We share the same values: respect for freedom and democracy, an unshakeable commitment to justice, human rights, and the rule of law. We are committed to the principles of gender equality and women's empowerment. We work together for peace and security.
As we near the end of your time in office, Mr. President, I would like to use this opportunity to commend your leadership, not least on the challenges of climate change, the conclusion of the Paris climate agreement, and on the Arctic.
The population of Iceland is a thousand smaller—a thousand times smaller than that of the United States. As you might expect from Viking-descended Northmen, we do not hide behind our apparent lack of superpower status. [Laughter] What we lack in manpower we make up in volcanoes. [Laughter] We are still figuring out how to aim them—[laughter]—however, so bear with us. [Laughter]
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to propose a toast: To the President, to the First Lady, to the people of the United States of America, and to the enduring friendship between our peoples. Skål!
[Prime Minister Johannsson offered a toast.]
Prime Minister Rasmussen. Mr. President; First Lady; dear colleagues from my neighboring countries; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen: ""Once, I was 7 years old, my mama told me, go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely."" [Laughter] Those lyrics are from the Danish singer Lukas Graham's number-one hit song here in the U.S. And I'm a lucky guy because my predecessors didn't wait for this song to be released before they actually followed this advice.
And therefore, I'm so privileged and happy to be here tonight, surrounded by friends from the Nordic countries, but first and foremost, you, Mr. President, and your fantastic and dedicated wife, Michelle, and all of your fellow Americans. The United States is truly one of Denmark's closest friends.
The first time you invited me into the Oval Office, Mr. President, you said that Denmark is punching above our weight. It made me proud. It made us Danes feel a little special. Now, some 6 years later, I understand that not only Denmark, but all the Nordic countries punch above our weight. [Laughter] But nevertheless, I'm still proud. [Laughter]
And I truly believe the same goes for my colleagues. So you can count on us. And you know that. And that's probably why we are all invited here tonight, because we punch above our weight. And we will continue to do so. And after tonight's splendid dinner, we will definitely step up into a whole new weight class. [Laughter] The ties between the United States and the Nordics are strong and go way back. As you said, Nordic Vikings cross the Atlantic centuries ago and discovered amazing America. And ever since, millions have—and ever since, millions left our rainy and windy countries looking for a new start in America. Many of them settled in Minnesota. [Laughter] I guess the weather there made them feel right at home. [Laughter] And the Nordic settlers took part in making America bright and beautiful.
Scarlett Johansson, of Danish descent, is just a living proof of that. [Laughter] And the Swedes and the Finns and the Icelanders did their part too, contributing to the gene pool that gave you Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, and Uma Thurman. And the Norwegians, well, they gave you Karl Rove—[laughter]—among many other things. [Laughter]
So I guess it's true to say that we have had a certain impact on America—[laughter]—in many different ways. So the good question is, can we Nordics still contribute to America? And the answer is a simple as it is famous: Yes, we can!
Nordic architects like Bjarke Ingels contribute to transforming American cities with projects like the New York Dryline and the redesign of the Smithsonian here in Washington, based on a vision of making urban areas more livable, smart, and sustainable. Both the U.S. and the Nordic countries try to set positive standards for the world of tomorrow, taking the lead, so to speak.
And speaking of taking the lead, speaking of leadership, it is easy to see the importance and value of your leadership, Mr. President. So without interfering in American politics, I can truly and without a doubt say that you have been the best President Europe never had.
Now your Presidency is coming to an end. And I have something to admit. I'm very fond of Donald too. [Laughter] I support him as a President. He's really smart, shows great leadership skills, a true visionary. And I'm, of course, talking about Donald Tusk, our Polish President of the European Council. [Laughter] Which, in your absence, is the best President Europe could have. [Laughter]
Well, being a role model is not always easy, so I've heard. But you, Mr. President, have come to represent a dream for millions of Americans and people across the world. We share a common vision of securing good, affordable health care to all. And I greatly respect your achievement in this regard. Your leadership was also key to the Paris Agreement on climate change last year. And we continue—well, both of us were disappointed after Copenhagen, but then, we worked hard, and finally, in Paris, we succeeded. And we continue our work together on the green transition.
And recently, Mr. President, you swept the White House in the rainbow colors. Being the first country on Earth to allow same-sex partnership, Denmark admires and supports your fight for diversity and equal rights.
Nevertheless, your Presidency is slowly coming to an end. So Congress will probably try to block both of your initiatives in the time to come. I guess that can be frustrating. Believe me, being leader of a very small minority Government, I know that from personal experience. [Laughter] And if I may, allow me to give you a piece of personal advice. When I get too frustrated, I let off steam by cooking. [Laughter] And I can recommend that. And if you do take my advice, I think you could be inspired by the new Nordic cuisine. It already involves edible rarities such as moss, bark, and living ants. [Laughter] But maybe you could be helpful in our search for a recipe for lame duck. [Laughter] Mr. President, you are a great friend and ally. Sólrun and I will always be very happy to welcome you and your family in Copenhagen. And Denmark would, as all the Nordic countries, I believe, be honored to receive one of the most inspirational and charming figures in America—along with her husband, of course. [Laughter]
So, dear Michelle, dear Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, let me propose a toast for the strong relations between our nations, the very special cross-Atlantic friendship between U.S. and the Nordic countries. To friendship. Skål! Cheers!
[Prime Minister Rasmussen offered a toast.]
President Obama. The dinner is now served. But I think we've just identified the next comic for the White House Correspondents' dinner. [Laughter]
Enjoy, everybody. Thank you!

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"February 20, 1980","
PRESIDENT CARTER. More than 2 million years ago in northern Tanzania and in southern Kenya, the first human beings stood erect and derived from that change a new freedom to use their bodies more effectively, to use their hands for constructive work, and began to develop a brain, which made freedom enjoyable for them. In the same country 2,000 years ago, long before our country was discovered by Columbus, the civilization had grown to such a point that the coastal region of eastern Africa was enjoying a thriving international trade, centered in a large part around the country which is now Kenya.
Sixteen years ago the people of Kenya, after a long struggle and even the imprisonment of their political leaders, became free and independent, and a republic was founded. Many people didn't believe it could survive and thrive and grow and that it could not stand the test, in the continent of Africa, of freedom and democratic elections and the honoring of human rights and the preservation of the individuality of the citizens of that country.
Mzee Jomo Kenyatta became an honored leader, not only of Kenya but admired throughout the world—a man of spirit and determination, a man of great courage, a man of great force of his personality, who brought together a disparate group of people and a common goal of preserving those human freedoms that are so precious to the people of that great country. Not only did he bring new life, new hope, new achievements, new leadership to the people of his own country but provided a spirit of hope and anticipation, confidence, and a dream of independence and freedom to many other people in Africa and, indeed, around the world, who had suffered under the burdens of colonialism for generations and even centuries.
The beauty of Kenya is astonishing to those who've been there. I stood beside President Moi tonight and had several people come through who are citizens of our Nation who have been to Kenya. And a frequent response to him was, ""You have the most beautiful country on Earth."" Because I'm the host, I didn't question that analysis— [laughter] —and since it came from Americans, I didn't want to question them either. [Laughter] But I think that those who have been there and those who've studied about Kenya, as I have—the last few days, in particular—know that it has been blessed by God with enormous and very beautiful natural resources, a highly diverse climate, beautiful mountains, lovely plains, access to the sea, and a strategic position in the eastern part of Africa.
Through hard work, through the honoring of human rights in its broadest definition, Kenya has not only enjoyed political growth but also great economic achievement and again has set an example for others to emulate.
Sixteen months ago came the death of Kenya's first President, and the world waited with bated breath to observe the test of democracy, under a relatively new constitution, and a testing of ancient customs, and the free balloting and expressions of their own will, of a free people. And the country stood the test, and a new President was chosen. And he has honored us here tonight by being our guest.
This is the first time that our Nation has enjoyed the presence of a President of Kenya, but we have enjoyed friendship, communication, a shared purpose, common goals, common ideals, ever since Kenya became a republic and a free nation. This test of democracy was passed with flying colors. And our guest tonight, after having been chosen to lead his country in the first and highest position, consolidated his strength there by constant travels throughout his great land.
The eastern coast of Africa is a turbulent part of the world, but there is a rock, an anchor, a bastion of freedom and stability, which is very beneficial to Kenya's neighbors as well as to its own people. Because of his diplomatic relationships with the leaders of other countries of Africa, Kenya continues to show the beneficent influence that it can exert on those who admire the achievements in that great land.
As a famous runner myself— [laughter] —when the land is flat— [laughter] I've always admired the wonderful achievements of Kenya's world-famous and world recordholders in the middle and long distances. Our President comes from the same part of the nation where a world recordholder lives now. He holds four world records, as a matter of fact. And they run up and downhill with no apparent difficulty at all. [Laughter] And because of that, the recent actions of our guest were very significant.
Kenya announced on their own initiative, after consideration of the principles on which their nation was formed, that they would not attend the Summer Olympics in Moscow, because the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan and taken away the freedom of the people of that country.
This action of leadership was typical of the principles that have permeated the life of our guest this evening. When he had lunch today with Secretary Warren Christopher, he said, ""When any person is deprived of freedom, I am deprived of freedom."" We admire leaders like this, and we honor them when they come to our country, and we cherish their friendship with us.
I would like to say, in closing, that it's reassuring to a great nation like our own to realize how much we have in common with the great nation of Kenya: a relatively short history of freedom since we escaped from colonial domination ourselves; a searching for human values which do not change in a rapidly changing turbulent world; the honoring of the rights of different kinds of people to live their own individual lives; to search for the ultimate in human achievement; to try to set an example for others when our beliefs are true; and the searching out of friends—not only neighbors but neighbors in spirit, who might live in far distant places. We are distant geographically one from another, but we're close because we share so much.
I would like to ask all our guests to join me in a toast: To the brave and free people of Kenya and to their leader, President Moi.
PRESIDENT MOI. Mr. President, I find it difficult to make a speech, because everybody is ready for dinner. [Laughter] Maybe it is better to start with a short speech and therefore relax.
Mr. President, I thank you very sincerely indeed for your warm welcome and kind words about myself and my .country. In our African traditions, sharing meals together is a very important element in expression of generosity and friendship. This dinner, Mr. President, has, therefore, great significance for us. I bring to you, Mr. President, and, through you, to all the citizens of the United States warm greetings from the people of Kenya.
I'm sure that I do not have to say that Kenyans know something about the United States and its people. Through many programs and cooperation, including trade, technical assistance, other forms of government-to-government programs, cultural contacts, and sports, Kenyans now do know a fair amount about this Nation and its people. Moreover, our interest in you is positive and steadily growing, especially because we share many objectives and values including democratic and constitutional forms of government.
I should also add that in you, Mr. President, we in Kenya see a great friend whom we can count upon. Not so long ago when our late President, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, passed away, you sent your own son Chip and his wife to represent you during the funeral ceremony. In the American team for that occasion was Justice Thurgood Marshall, a good friend of ours and someone who assisted in structuring Kenya's Constitution. Your interest and demonstrated friendship to us is one of the reasons why we are very happy to be here this week.
Another reason to thank you and the people of the United States—for the help which you have given us since our independence. We were most heartened in the early days of our independence by the great interest which the people of this Nation showed in our future development. That interest was demonstrated in a very visible and concrete manner through various forms of cooperation-cooperation which included the development of our youth, involving the establishment of our national youth service, and generous offers of training and education contribution in your institutions. Indeed, many of the young people who have received education and training in the United States are now in responsible positions in the development of our country; some of them are Ministers.
Mr. President, we have done the best we can in making use of assistance received from you and our other friends abroad. If I were asked to summarize the situation so far, I would say that the development of our nation since independence—a development which has been fairly impressive by standards elsewhere in the developing world—is largely due to three factors: The first one is good leadership by our late President; the second is the tremendous determination by our people to promote their own development and welfare; and third is the support received from our friends abroad.
In many ways these are the same requirements for the future. However, that future now looks uncertain for countries such as Kenya because of some external forces well beyond their control. In fact, countries such as mine can be described as innocent bystanders when major matters affecting their own survival are being discussed or carried out.
It is for this reason that I consider one of the real challenges facing the international community today to be how all of us can participate effectively in planning the future of the international community. Those who are strong .and wealthy must not take those who are small and poor for granted. A solution to this particular challenge will, of course, facilitate global solutions for the various crises now facing the world.
There is another aspect of this relationship between the strong and wealthy nations on one hand, and the poor nations on the other, which I would like to mention; this is the very important issue of territorial integrity. Some recent events indicate the urgent need to give assurance to all nations that they can live without fear that their territorial integrity will be violated. And there can be no doubt that such fear undermines the very foundation on which to build a happier future for each and every nation.
At this juncture I would like to say that no country can be isolated from problems happening elsewhere; they can be for you today and for me tomorrow. So, there is no distinction between what is happening today and what may happen tomorrow to any nation.
There are, of course, other urgent matters facing the international community. One of them, which is a particularly dangerous one, is the whole question of prevailing mass poverty in the Third World. As I said in the Federal Republic of Germany last week, there can be no lasting peace and prosperity in any part of the world when there is poverty and despair in most of the world. Moreover, the solution to many of the economic problems now facing the industrial countries can only be solved if there is more rapid development in the Third World.
And finally, the world has the resources and technology to deal with the development problem, provided there is political commitment. I believe that the need for such commitment is now obvious to all, because self-interest reinforces the valid arguments based on morality and responsibility. We hope that the United States will be even more active in providing leadership in this field.
Mr. President, I should perhaps now stress that the purpose of my present visit to your country is not only to discuss issues like these but also to exchange views on bilateral relations between the United States and Kenya. Here, I'm happy to say that these relations are good and that I expect them to grow even stronger in the years to come.
We in Kenya are trying hard to promote the development of our people, under very severe constraints. Our success so far demonstrates that steady progress towards that objective can be made even without valuable minerals, provided there is peace, effective leadership, and determined efforts on our part and, of course, a favorable external environment.
Some people complain that maybe God did not give others oil. I always say, each country has its own gifts from God, and therefore, no one should complain. Somebody from my own country asked me, ""Why have we not got oil?"" I told him, ""We have fresh .air; it is a gift of God."" [Laughter] Others may have oil, but they suffer from the heat of the Sun. [Laughter] And so, we should not complain. God, even in our generation—and that means we should not be selfish—even in our generation we may not find oil or other valuable things, but in the years to come, our children and the future generations may discover the things which we want to have now.
Now, Mr. President, I'm now concerned that recent developments in the eastern African region may create conditions which will make it difficult for us to develop as rapidly as we expected. In particular, it would be disastrous for all the countries of that region if they are compelled to use their own scarce resources on more and more military expenditures. What the region needs is peace, cooperation, and good neighborliness. We in Kenya will continue to do the best we can to promote such a climate. But it is a climate which cannot be established by only one country. This important and urgent job calls for active commitment on the part of each nation involved.
Before I sit down, Mr. President, I would like to say that we in Kenya continue to admire your commitment and decisive efforts to uphold human rights everywhere in the world. If there is one thing which can unite us all and which makes ideological arguments truly irrelevant, it is the whole subject of human rights and human dignity. This is so important to the human race. If we can all uphold that principle, then I think you are lucky.
The United States, from George Washington up to Jimmy Carter, you have had those cherished ideals, which have made this Nation a strong nation—not the weapons, not other things that matter. It is what has made you so united. It enables the citizens of this great nation, free—free to express the things they want to do and thereby enable each one of you to be free, as God meant us to be. And therefore, we in Kenya value the dignity of man. We therefore strongly support your efforts in this area, in practice, in everything.
The reason why—and I indicated it this morning—why I had to ask my National Sports Council that we should not participate in the Olympics, not because of anything else, because our own conscience, our own dignity is being undermined. And I did say this afternoon that nobody should ask me, to sit on me, that I must cooperate. It is ridiculous, when those Afghanistanis are being suppressed, and we are told, ""Let us cooperate."" And I said before, when the lives of those people are threatened, mine is threatened. Why should I cooperate then? Those who would like to cooperate maybe are following the same ideals—ideals which are not worthwhile supporting.
And in any case, we made—we Kenyans, we made sacrifices because we were very hopeful that we were going to secure gold medals, silver, and the rest. Others, of course, are participating with no prospects of securing one. [Laughter]
In the case of Africa, there is a particularly serious situation of apartheid in South Africa, which again touches human rights. That situation is a tragic one, because it is also preventing that country from playing its rightful role in the development of Africa, and all which is potentially, exceedingly important.
Mr. President, I also take this opportunity to say how we in Kenya are encouraged by your untiring efforts to promote peace and cooperation in the Middle East. Our stand on this matter has been made very clear to all. We urge the nations of that region to accept negotiations as a method for finding a lasting solution, a solution which must include a homeland for the Palestinian people and a solution which must also include acceptance of the right to live for all the people of the Middle East.
Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank you for the discussions we had today. As I explained, the economic problems created by external forces beyond our control compel us to look for more assistance from the United States and other friends. Here I should add that we also look forward to greater private investment. Our policies in this field and our commitment to honor our obligations are well known.
Mr. President, once again I thank you and Mrs. Carter for this reception. I hope you will one day visit us in Kenya. If it were not that you are in the middle of elections, I would say I invite you to Kenya. [Laughter] Nevertheless, I wish you success, and my invitation is extended to you, hoping that you will succeed— [laughter] —and come and see us, see our little country, Kenya.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and join me in a toast: To the health and happiness of President Carter and strengthened cooperation between the United States and the Republic of Kenya.
THE PRESIDENT. I'll drink to that.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"September 15, 1999","
Thank you very much. Forgive my hoarseness.
First, Prime Minister, to you, your family, your government, and the people of New Zealand, I cannot thank you enough for the wonderful welcome that our party and my family members have received here. I apologize for having to rush home, but all of you know of the great storm that is now hitting the American coast. We had to move over 2 1/2 million people today in an attempt to minimize the loss of life. So I hope you'll forgive me, but let me say I have had a wonderful time here.
I'm glad that the fashion people approved of the way I wore the beautiful outfit you gave me. [Laughter] You know, I've been President 7 years now. I've been all over the world. I've received any number of items of clothing. And when you go to these meetings, very often the people who are there get the native dress, and we wear them. And usually, when I go home, there is someone making fun of how I looked in the dress of whatever country I was. This is the smartest outfit I've ever been given.
In the calendar cycle, we in the Northern Hemisphere are moving in the opposite direction, so we're coming into fall and winter. And if you watch the television, I'll probably be in your outfit several times more before the end of the year.
Let me say from the bottom of my heart, this has been a magical trip. I think every person, when he or she is young, dreams of finding some enchanted place, of beautiful mountains and breathtaking coastline and clear lakes and amazing wildlife, and most people give up on it because they never get to New Zealand. This has been an amazing thing for me and for all of us.
You might be interested to know that on the front page of the Washington Post today, there is a picture of my National Economic Adviser bungee jumping. [Laughter] We all had to remind him that he wasn't supposed to be Houdini and slip the cords, you know. [Laughter] And so the whole story was about how much fun we were all having.
I hope that it will also be reported that at this meeting we took a strong stand for freedom and human rights in East Timor, and we are going in there, together with our friends from Australia and others in this region, to try to protect the integrity of the referendum for democracy and independence, and save lives. And I thank New Zealand for its leadership in this cause. We also stood for the proposition that we can best lift the world's fortune by having more free and fair trade. And that, too, was profoundly important.
We celebrated today our partnership in Antarctica and talked about the importance of Antarctica to our whole future. I have mentioned often that, as all of you know proudly, when the new millennium dawns, it will dawn first on New Zealand. I will be proud to cross that bridge into the 21st century with you, knowing that we will be partners for peace and prosperity and a more decent and humane future for all our children. And I thank you for that partnership.
I'd like to ask all of you to join me in a toast to the Prime Minister, to her wonderful husband, to her government, and to the people of New Zealand.
[At this point, the participants drank a toast.]
Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"March 07, 1978","
PRESIDENT CARTER. First of all, I would like to say that my wife, Rosalynn, and I welcome all of you to the White House. We here tonight and all the people of the United States are deeply honored by the visit of a great world leader, President Tito of Yugoslavia.
We've had a delightful conversation during supper. I found that he has some things in common with us. He has a private farm where he grows .grapes and produces wine. It's my second favorite vine, the first one being peanuts, of course. [Laughter]
Although we do have differences there, my brother, Billy, as you know, is- [laughter] —he produces beer, not wine. [Laughter]
President Tito is a man of great courage. He was telling me that there is an island—which some of our guests here at the head table, the Harrimans at least, have visited—about 2 1/2 miles wide, 5 miles long, where he has a tremendous collection of puma, lions, camels, elephants, other animals, wild boar. I know very well how he feels when he goes there for a weekend, very similar to the way I felt when I came to Washington 13 years ago. [Laughter]
President Tito is a leader who has welcomed many great Americans to his country. One of the first was in 1944. President Tito, then an early leader of Yugoslavia toward freedom, was in his headquarters when a B-24 crashed in a barnyard while he watched the plane go down.
Out of the B-24 stepped the crew. The first man out of the plane was George McGovern. [Laughter] This is a true story. And ever since, President Tito has welcomed American visitors of great distinction to his country. [Laughter]
This is a world leader who has led his people and protected their freedom almost for the last 40 years. Through peace and war, he has been part of the personal history of the world during our own generation and the previous generation.
James Reston, who interviewed President Tito recently, said that he is the last political giant of this century. He's a man of eternal strength, of eternal youth, of eternal vigor, and of eternal courage.
The Nation of Yugoslavia has been close to us in the United States since its very foundations, when Woodrow Wilson, our President, was instrumental in helping Yugoslavia become a country.
President Tito was a contemporary of great men, Prime Minister Churchill, President Roosevelt, General de Gaulle, and, as you know, many others, particularly Stalin. And he, along with President Nasser and Prime Minister Nehru, originated the concept of the strength of the nonaligned nations.
Not only the world but he's watched the history of the United States evolve. I'm the seventh American President in succession whom he has known.
He is a man who is very vigorous in his leadership. Within the last 8 or 9 months he's visited many countries personally, including the People's Republic of China, Peking; the Soviet Union, 'Moscow; our own country, Washington.
He's constantly searching for common beliefs and common hopes and common dreams that can unite people who might otherwise be separated by a lack of communication or differences in philosophical or political outlook.
He's a man who believes in disarmament. As a matter of fact, he is a father of the upcoming United Nations conference on disarmament.
He's a man who believes in human rights. He was the host this past few months of the human rights conference which was designed to assess the progress of the Helsinki agreement in that matter, human rights, plus searching for a more common ground on which the nations of Eastern and Western Europe might unite and resolve our differences.
Early in the present conflict between Israel and her neighbors, he told me today, on a trip to Egypt he reminded that Arab nation, which was then involved in disharmony and even hatred and war with Israel, that a time had come to recognize the right of Israel to exist and to exist in peace.
There is a feeling of personal friendship and warmth and admiration that exists among the people of the United States toward this great leader and the land which he has guided through very difficult times in recent decades.
On behalf of the American people, I would like to offer a toast to the great and courageous leader, President Tito, and to the independent and proud country which he leads, Yugoslavia.
PRESIDENT TITO. Mr. President, dear Mrs. Carter, ladies and gentlemen, friends:
May I first thank you sincerely for the expressions of welcome, the exquisite hospitality you are surrounding us with, and particularly for the friendly words you have addressed to the peoples of Yugoslavia and to me personally.
I wish straightaway to underscore my pleasure at the successful development of relations and ever broader cooperation in numerous fields between our two countries, to which you, Mr. President, are contributing so much.
In founding the relations on the familiar principles of equality, noninterference, and mutual respect, Yugoslavia and the United States have, by the results that we have achieved, reaffirmed to the full extent the vitality and the irreplaceable validity of these principles.
This can only encourage us to proceed along that path and these bases in developing increasingly our cooperation in political and economic fields, in science, technology, engineering, culture, tourism, and other spheres.
I am certain that this is also a safe way for the constant strengthening of friendship between our peoples, for the building of mutual confidence and respect, and thereby also for a constructive contribution to the creation of better conditions in the world.
I am convinced—and your words, Mr. president, encourage me in it—that this visit and our talks will serve these objectives in the best possible manner.
While speaking of the tradition of our friendship and the invaluable links between our two countries, I should like to recall the exceptional contribution to it made by many Yugoslavs who found in your country their new homeland, and who have been devoting their talents and work and who continue to devote them to the development of your country and to the well-being of mankind.
Mr. President, in the endeavors towards peace, stability, and progress today, detente is undoubtedly that major preoccupation of both the United States and Yugoslavia, as well as of almost all countries in the world.
We are deeply convinced that detente can fulfill the expectations of all the peoples of our planet if it becomes a universal process and if it encompasses all the burning problems of the day—first and foremost political, military, and economic-as at present, we live in a world of such interdependence that its fate is ultimately common.
Crises and problems necessarily affect everybody by the same token as the progress and achievements of each people become the possession and inspiration of the entire humanity. It is for this reason that we deem it indispensable that parallel with avoiding confrontations between big powers, basic problems of development should be resolved, as well as those in the field of disarmament, that the policy of power and interference into the internal affairs of others should be eliminated from international relations, and that the efforts of all countries should be aimed at the overcoming of bloc and other divisions in the world, as well as the establishment of a new and more just international economic order.
All these problems bear on the vital interests of the whole mankind. Widely acceptable solutions have to be found to them if we are to secure survival, peaceful development, and prosperity for everybody.
I should like to point out that Yugoslavia, like many other countries, is especially interested in the elimination of existing focal points of armed conflicts which at any time may become the source of new, still greater crises of widest proportions.
Particularly worrying at the present juncture is the crisis in the Middle East, which is increasing tension in the region of the whole Mediterranean. Any complication or any further aggravation of the situation in the Middle East constitutes-and this we are profoundly convinced of—constitutes an extremely serious threat to peace and security in this region, with consequences affecting a wide range of countries.
We have been pointing out on numerous occasions our views, founded on the decisions of the United Nations and nonaligned countries, on the irreplaceable ways for bringing about a just and durable solution to the crisis and thereby also for the creation of the indispensable preconditions for the security and cooperation of all the countries and all the peoples in the region.
Here I would just like to point out that it would be extremely dangerous indeed to allow the possibility of having the policy of force and forceable acquisition of foreign territories—those in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world-even partly pay.
Likewise, I should like to voice my firm conviction that it is quite inadmissible that today an entire nation—I mean the Palestinians should be denied the elementary national rights that other nations have been enjoying for centuries, and that the settlement of the Palestinian problem is essential and is the core of the solution and lasting settlement of the crisis in the Middle East as a whole.
During our recent exchange of messages, we could, Mr. President, note a considerable closeness of our positions on the need for the parties to the conflict in the Horn of Africa to find a peaceful solution to their problems trader this spirit without interference from outside, and on the basis of mutual respect, independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and nonintervention in each other's affairs.
I think that such an approach should be applied also to other parts of Africa. It must not be allowed that any region, either in that or in any other continent, should become the ground for the contention of blocs of big powers. Any such rivalry carries in itself the danger of a broader conflict with consequences that necessarily affect the entire international community.
I am confident that our views are also close in that it is necessary within the framework of the efforts of all member states of the United Nations further to promote constantly, integrally, universally, human rights as one of the essential ingredients in the strengthening of the equitable international cooperation and peace in the world. And an end should be put as soon as possible to colonialism, racism, and apartheid in southern Africa and everywhere else in the world where these deplorable vestiges of the sinister past of part of mankind still survive.
I should also like to stress that Yugoslavia fully shares the concern by the overwhelming number of countries over the unabated continuation of the arms race, which exposes mankind to tremendous dangers and, it is needless to say, greatly encumbers the settlement of the essential political and economic problems in the world we live in.
For this reason, we view the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to disarmament as an exceptional opportunity for a joint effort of all the world organizations, member countries, to its opening up for the sake of the security of the present and future generations a process of genuine disarmament.
We cherish a deep hope, Mr. President, that both you, personally, and your country will provide your share which will give an impetus to this process, which will, beyond any doubt, earn you well-deserved recognition.
May I also on this occasion emphasize how great importance for peace, security, and the prosperity of all countries have the building of new, more just economic relations in the world and particularly the promotion of an accelerated economic development of developing countries and the finding of solutions to the problems of energy, raw materials, food, the transfer of technology, and others.
The solution of this, I would say, major problem of the present-day world would constitute is the historic imperative of our time. Any delay of this resolution constitutes a serious risk of creating an atmosphere in which a search for solutions reached by common agreement would be made considerably more difficult.
Mr. President, the movement of nonalignment: to which Yugoslavia belongs and within which it has been active ever since its beginning, has become today a recognized factor in the world due to its consistent struggle for peace and security, for equality and unimpeded development, for the settlement of burning issues of the present-day world.
A comprehensive emancipation of nations and countries, decolonization and creation by means of the establishment of the new economic order of genuine preconditions for the prosperity of all countries are inseparably linked with the activities of nonaligned countries. These ideals and objectives are in no way new. They permeated our aspirations also at a time of the founding of the United Nations.
The movement of nonaligned is a logical expression of the objective need of the present, still considerably divided world. It is an exceptionally important part, an active factor of the process of detente. It can be discerned that there is growing consciousness and awareness in the world of such a role of the movement of nonaligned countries in the current development of international relations.
Therefore, every attempt at weakening the nonaligned movement and that linking its parts to one or the other bloc is inevitably directed against detente itself, against the strengthening and expansion of peaceful coexistence. And this leads to dangers that might affect the nonaligned countries and countries belonging to blocs alike.
I have already mentioned the interdependence of the world, which requires from all countries—irrespective of their size, might, and affiliation—close cooperation, coupled with mutual respect. The nonaligned countries always stand ready for such cooperation. Their decisions and activity are inspired by it, and it is my firm belief that the only way for mankind to move towards a more secure future lies in this very cooperation, rather than confrontation.
We have been guided by it also in our activity during the Belgrade followup meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, at which Yugoslavia, as the host, has special responsibilities.
We certainly believe that it is paramount for all the states participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to equally exert efforts towards a constant strengthening of the process of relaxation and cooperation in the spirit of Helsinki, for only thus may this process yield results which millions of people in Europe, the United States, and Canada, as well as in the rest of the world, expect from it.
Any attempt to impose unilateral interests casts a shadow over the already attained level of confidence and throws us back into the past, while the very nature of the process of detente makes it incumbent on us, due to the accountability of all countries and peoples to themselves, to move constantly forward.
Yugoslavia and the United States of America have been cooperating successfully in the international field already for a number of years. This cooperation dates back to a time when sharing on the same side the hardships of the past World War, we were searching for the best means to make it possible for the world to live in peace, understanding, and friendship.
I profoundly believe that now we shall deepen this cooperation still further in our mutual and even broader interest. The United States is a big power. Yugoslavia's part of the nonaligned movement. It is for this very reason, this very reason, which calls for our two countries to cooperate more closely in the search for widely acceptable solutions to pressing international problems.
Such a Yugoslav-American cooperation can only contribute to a broader international understanding so greatly needed in the present world.
Our view is that differences, sometimes substantial and often unavoidable, are not nor ought to be an obstacle to cooperation; but, quite on the contrary, one more reason for dialog and for search for agreed solutions. In this respect, we already have very positive experience.
Mr. President, I wish to point out that we highly appreciate the contribution made by your country and by you, personally, to the cause of understanding and cooperation in the world.
You have invested a great amount of good will in resolving certain problems. May I mention the Panama Canal agreement as an illustration.
In this agreement you have, together with the Government of Panama, encouraged the hope that it is possible-and I would also add, indispensable-to resolve in a similar way other outstanding international problems as well. Your country has thereby only gained in the eyes of the world.
Mr. President, I am sure that our talks will show that we have much in common and will provide a strong impetus to our future cooperation in all fields, as well as that by our candid and constructive approach we shall contribute to better knowledge of each other and broader understanding in the world. For this reason, I think that our talks transcend the Yugoslav-American framework and reflect far broader interests.
It is with this in mind, and in a sense of satisfaction and gratitude for such a warm reception, that I propose this toast to your health, Mr. President, to that of Mrs. Carter, for the further prosperity of the friendly American people, for the comprehensive development of relations and ever closer cooperation between our two countries, for Yugoslav-American friendship, for increasing understanding, respect, and cooperation in the world.

state-dinners,George Bush,"October 18, 1990","
The President. Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Antall and to our Hungarian and American friends, I am glad you are all here, especially those from out of town, because so many are grounded or circling at this very moment trying to get here. [Laughter]
But it is a great pleasure for Barbara and me to welcome you both to the White House tonight. There's a great poet of Hungary's 1848 Revolution, Sandor Petofi, once wrote: ""Let me address you in the name of millions."" And so, tonight, Mr. Prime Minister, let me greet you in the name of millions who convey their warmest welcome, the people of the United States.
And as I look around this room, I see why Americans feel so enriched by our long friendship with the Hungarian people. We see the kinship in the nearly 2 million Americans of Hungarian descent: in giants like nuclear scientist Edward Teller -- we're honored to have here with us tonight -- or conductor Eugene Ormandy, who proved that music is the universal language, or Colonel Kovacs, who gave his life for America's struggle for freedom way back during our own Revolutionary War.
But this kinship isn't just one way. Americans admire Hungarians whose deeds so inspire us, heroes like the great founder of the Hungarian state, St. Stephen, and great composers like Liszt and Bartok, or Hungary's many winners of Nobel prizes or Olympic medals, or that great patriot Janos Hunyadi, who more than five centuries ago stopped foreign invasion. In his honor, the Pope ordered each Catholic church in Europe to ring its bell at midday. And since then, Catholic church bells all over the world ring precisely at noon. Heroes, yes -- American, Hungarian.
Today, more than ever, this kinship binds the people of the United States and Hungary. And our nations are linked by many things: hard work, the role of community, religious devotion, and of course a fierce love of freedom. And especially during the past 2 years, your gallantry has evoked our admiration. Your example has been our inspiration.
When we were in Budapest last year, I was given a piece of the Iron Curtain. And I keep it there in my office that you visited today, sir, as a stark symbol of Hungary's courageous decision to open its borders, unleashing a force that helped transform Europe and eventually brought down the Berlin Wall.
If Kossuth could be with us here tonight, he would see that his dream of a free and democratic Hungary had been fulfilled, and he would see that this new day in Hungary's history is the result of the Hungarian people's determination to live in freedom. Your presence here tonight, Mr. Prime Minister, bears testimony to Hungary's new role as a sovereign member of the new and growing partnership of nations.
The darkness lifts, the bell resounds, and the light grows brighter by the day. And so, Mr. Prime Minister, let us raise our glasses, and let us raise what Kossuth called the morning star of liberty. God bless you, and as your national anthem proclaims so unforgettably, ""God Bless the Hungarians."" We are very pleased you're here, sir. To your health.
The Prime Minister. I consider this day a great day in the life of the Hungarians and to all of us. We feel that you have done a lot for our freedom, because you have been determined, because you have stuck to all those moral principles that your forefathers and the Founding Fathers have brought home in this country.
And this past also binds both you and ourselves. We are proud that Hungarians were able to do a lot for America. It is a special, very good feeling to be able to be here. And it is also a good feeling that, with your national flag, the Stars and Stripes, the humble Hungarian tricolor is also on the same level with you.
We have restored the old Hungarian coat of arms and the holy crown -- according to tradition, the crown of King Stephen the Saint was preserved by you. And sometime in the future, historian may find that the return of the crown played a very important role to once again being able to identify ourselves within our own self. Thousands and thousands of people pay tribute in front of it when the party state still was operating and was in function. We at home, we once again felt we were Hungarians, and we also felt the great pressure of this old traditional symbol. Afterwards, Hungarians came back to visit Hungary who had not been to Hungary before.
Your visit last year, Mr. President, took place at a time when the opposition carried out with the first negotiations in the framework of the opposition in roundtable talks. Your presence has once again encouraged us. And I am sure that you may also have felt the feeling that the United States of America, and personally you, are so popular. And please accept my apologies for this exaggeration that, perhaps, not so popular anywhere else in the world. [Laughter]
Well, Mr. President, suppose you don't have a chance to be a third-time President of the United States. I am sure the Hungarian nation would willingly elect you as President. [Laughter]
I raise my glass to eternal friendship of the United States of America and Hungary and to you, personally, Mr. President and Mrs. Bush.
"
state-dinners,George Bush,"February 20, 1991","
The President. Prince Henrik, and ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a pleasure for Barbara and me to salute Queen Margrethe II, the heir to a thousand-year-old monarchy and the head of state of our very close friend and ally Denmark.
We honor her tonight as a superb queen and ruler. And yet we also honor her as an artist, translator, and scholar whose work aptly reflects the civilized and humane qualities of the Danish people.
And we also welcome and honor this evening Prince Henrik, our very special guest, an accomplished and energetic man whose contributions in business and in the environment and in charitable work have brought great credit to Denmark from all around the world.
We've been delighted that Her Majesty and the Prince Consort have chosen to send their sons Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim to travel and study in our country. In fact, we take it as a great national compliment that Prince Henrik, who owns a vineyard in France, sent the Crown Prince to study and work at a California winery. [Laughter] Very broadminded Prince we have here. [Laughter]
And from her birth during the darkest days of World War II, when she was seen as a symbol of hope for a nation under occupation, Queen Margrethe has been a source of inspiration to her country. She personifies the spirit of the Danish people, their courage during World War II, their many achievements today, and overall, their love of freedom.
Throughout its history, Denmark has been a guardian of liberty in both peacetime and war. Since President Jefferson and King Christian VII first established diplomatic relations, our nations have jointly fostered the liberty which sets and keeps men free. We saw that in World War II when Denmark smuggled virtually all of its Jews to freedom and when, even under occupation, almost your entire Danish merchant fleet willingly helped the Allies.
And tonight, your Navy and ours sail together in the Gulf. And this time we stand together against another brutal dictator, against another aggressor. Your Majesty, I am very proud that tonight with us is not only General Powell, who you met -- the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, but also the two ranking enlisted men in both our Navy and our Army, Master Chief Petty Officer Bushey and Sergeant Major of the Army Gates. And they and their colleagues from all our services are doing a superb job, just as your military people aboard your vessel are.
And I must tell you, Your Majesty, that our country is united behind them totally today, exactly as we were united in World War II. And patriotism is high here now -- and for our purpose, you see, is clear and our mission is just. And we are going to prevail. And your forces and ours will guarantee that the torch of freedom will illuminate Kuwait.
Thirty-one years ago, one of Denmark's greatest leaders, your father, said it best: ""Let us unite,"" said King Frederik in a toast to President Eisenhower, ""in the hope that the torch of freedom which we received from our fathers may also illuminate the path of our descendants for generations to come."" And in that spirit I ask all of our guests tonight to raise their glasses to a third century, a third century of Danish-American friendship; to the peace we seek to win, the peace we intend to keep; and especially to Her Majesty and His Royal Highness and what they symbolize both for Denmark and to the United States and for the entire world.
To your health, Your Majesty.
Queen Margrethe. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush. The Prince Consort and I are deeply moved by the warm words of welcome which the President of the United States has just addressed to us and by the friendship towards Denmark which he has so beautifully expressed.
We are very much aware that our first state visit to the United States coincides in time with a serious war involving American forces as well as forces from many other nations under the auspices of the United Nations. We all hope that the suffering and the sacrifices of the war, brought into every home and all too vividly impressed on every mind by modern means of communication, will lead to respect and furtherance of the ideals of the United Nations.
Mr. President, the position of your office is unique among heads of state, not only because the United States is a world power but because the President is obliged to lead his country and fulfill his duties under the constant eye of the public -- indeed, in the glare of global publicity.
You have impressed us all, Mr. President, by the way in which you perform your functions in the face of these demanding conditions, dedicated to your high office and conscious of its obligations. You have come across as a man of integrity and a fellow human being not only to your own people but to so many others as well. And nobody can fail to notice the warm relationship and the personal support that you receive from Mrs. Bush.
The United States of America belongs to what is known as the New World, and that is the way you often like to characterize yourselves. But anyone who, like myself, has visited your country in 1976 when the American people celebrated the bicentennial is also aware of the long and proud tradition which you have established and that you so rightly cherish.
The Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution were directly inspired by political and philosophical thought as expounded by enlightened circles in Europe of that day. But the American contribution was unique. It kindled that spark which sooner or later gave rise to constitutional reform in countries all over Europe, including Denmark. The ideas of a just and humane society that caused such profound changes more than a century ago have never lost their relevance nor their impetus.
They lie behind the charter of the United Nations, and they have been reaffirmed in a number of international instruments for the protection of human rights. Only recently we have seen how people in Eastern Europe, under an intolerable pressure, found strength precisely in those values and ideas in order to realize their hopes for a better existence. Indeed, did not an echo of the opening words of your Constitution ring through their streets: ""We, the people.""
The ideals which inspired the Founding Fathers of the United States are as challenging today as they were more than 200 years ago. They are an everlasting spur to us all who try to follow them and to see them implemented. Sometimes we may almost despair of living up to them in practice. But we should never forget that they are ideals -- and ideals are never attained though we constantly attempt to fulfill them.
Generations of Americans and generations of Danes have lived in that attempt. Sometimes we've felt that we did succeed. Sometimes we've seemed to have fallen far, far short. Maybe those shared ideals and parallel experiences are part of the reason why we understand each other and like each other.
Ladies and gentlemen, I raise my glass in honor of the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush, and drink to the deep and warm friendship between our two countries and to the continued prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States of America.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"December 04, 1984","
President Reagan. Good evening, and welcome to the White House.
This has been a special time for us. Today we've had the opportunity to exchange views and get to know President Lusinchi, an individual whose strength of conviction and personal bravery helped give birth to democracy in his country. Tonight we honor you, Mr. President, for what you've done, for what you're doing, and for the kind of man you are.
In this beautiful setting, the hard sacrifices of our own Founding Fathers seem so long ago, yet all of what we have has been built on the foundation they laid. President Lusinchi remembers well Venezuela's fight for political freedom. He was part of it. As a young man, he committed himself to the cause of democracy. He was arrested and tortured by the dictatorship. And, Mr. President, I'm told the beatings left welts on your back similar to the stripes of a tiger. Well, you had the spirit of a tiger, and you never gave up your ideals.
Venezuela is free today because it has people of such character. Last year you celebrated 25 years of continuous democratic government in Venezuela. Commemorating that, you said, ""We have discovered that democracy and liberty go together inextricably together."" It was fitting that last year was also the 200th anniversary of the birth of Simon Bolivar, a Venezuelan whose struggle gave independence to the hemisphere. Today you carry on the work of this truly all-American man. And when we say ""American,"" we mean every one of us, from the North Slope of Alaska to the tip of Tierra del Fuego—all of us are Americans in this hemisphere.
I'd like to thank you, Mr. President, for what your country is doing for the cause of democracy in this hemisphere. Your support during the Grenada crisis was most appreciated. Your efforts in Central America and the Caribbean are of great importance to the future of freedom there. Your personal guidance to me in the years ahead will be as invaluable as it has been today.
We're proud to stand with you and to have you and your countrymen as our friends. Mr. President, you represent in so many ways, the deep ties between our two peoples. Today, instead of ""Welcome,"" we should have said, ""Welcome back,"" for you lived with us during your time of exile, studying medicine and working in Bellevue Hospital in New York.
As a political figure, you've been concerned about the freedom and progress of your people. As a physician, you understand human suffering. This understanding is reflected in the energetic commitment that you've made to battling the flow of narcotics through Venezuela and the Caribbean region. As you're aware, the drug abuse problem is something that your dinner partner, Nancy, and I feel strongly about. Nancy has spent many hours here trying to help the victims of drug addiction, especially young people.
For your efforts to stop illegal drugs before they reach our shore, you have our personal thanks.
Americans know there's a special spirit in Venezuela, and that spirit is hard to miss when you have Tony Armas hitting towering home runs like they were the easiest thing to do. Well, the free people of Venezuela and the United States are on the same team, and we're up to bat. So, in keeping with the lessons Tony Armas has been teaching us, let's set our sights high, work as a team, and assure democracy and improving economic well-being for all the people of the Americas.
Now, will you all join me in a toast to President Lusinchi, the people of Venezuela, and the things that we can and will accomplish together.
President Lusinchi. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, I understand fully that this evening, this dinner, is a homage to my country, Venezuela, a country which, taking account the difference in dimensions, has much in common with the United States. For just as the United States, it is an integrator of races, religions, and ambitions. Your country and my country, Mr. President, are both lands of possibilities. I understand this fully, and this is why I believe that both the United States and Venezuela have had a common history in the past and have for the future a common destiny.
This, in part, has made us very proud to be here and very happy to see that these Americans can organize things so well. They know so much and they understand so much that they were able even to make the climate work in favor of the beautiful reception we had this morning. And President Reagan has been very kind this evening to sit me beside your guardian angel on one side and a Venezuelan angel on the other side, Mrs. Cisnaros, who is highly representative of Venezuelan women.
I had thought to say a few words on this occasion, but your generosity and your warmth, Mr. President, have compelled me to use, before I say those words, all my old parliamentary resources. But one hesitates here on a visit of state such as mine—and I came here as head of government and President of the Republic of Venezuela—so I must say therefore, in this capacity, that we small countries seem to have cultivated somewhat the right to dissent; and discrepancy has often become the object of much worship, and disagreement with the strong has become the consolation often of the weak. At times, we disagree just to highlight the existing difference or simply to reaffirm our wish to exercise autonomous thought and action. There are many occasions to dissent, to express different views, or to celebrate coincidences. And this, also, is totally legitimate.
Even if the United States is the most powerful nation on Earth, besides holding diverging views, we also find with you many convergences and totally legitimate ones, as well. And I must say this very frankly, proudly, and candidly. In a ceremony such as the present one, I think it is much more intelligent, much more human, to highlight, rather, all that unites us, all that identifies us to each other and leave aside what might have been something that can separate this great world power from a country such as ours, cognizant of its dimensions and its possibilities.
Permit me to leave aside thoughts on important substance matters. I do not want to run the risk of appearing solemn when it would be out of place to do so. I am not a declared enemy of solemnity itself, but I do believe it must be exercised on appropriate occasions. Some people never depart from it and yearn to appear solemn every single hour and minute of their lives. I'm happy to say that this is neither your case, Mr. President, or mine. And, in part, this is because both of us are common men. In some way, must one become, after all, eligible for the benevolence of history, even if it is to be through the exercise of discretion.
I have come to the United States and to this mansion of Presidents as a spokesman and representative of a country and a people friendly to the United States. I have come to express our views on bilateral issues of two friendly nations—on issues of our hemisphere, we cannot and shall not be indifferent to and on world issues on which we Venezuelans do not exert much influence, but which affect us to a high degree.
The biggest pride of Venezuelans is perhaps to feel that we are a country that holds no prejudices, no dogmas, no intolerances. And I say this to you—I've said it to you, Mrs. Reagan, with great pride during this dinner—and I believe that this is what makes us firmly believe, in part, that in spite of our backwardness in some economic and social areas, we are a country the future will favor, perhaps because the future lies for those who, as ourselves, show an open mind and a willing heart.
I said before that all work today to make this a beautiful celebration for me, and even the fact that a year ago—it is just a year ago that I won elections, Mr. President, by as large a landslide as you did. [Laughter] And there is something even more important, because in our case, we even got all the votes of your Minnesota. [Laughter] So, today we have really given to us a great present—you have been so kind, you have shown to us so much graciousness. Your words have been so pleasant, you have given me the occasion to speak to your beautiful and distinguished wife, beautiful representative of American Women we much admire.
And so, allow me also to take this occasion of having many common friends with us to congratulate you here, Mr. President, on your electoral victory and to wish you an extraordinary second term. The Government, all the people of the United States, hope to get from you and as citizen of the world, all the contribution you and your country can make to peace, solidarity, a better living for all the people of this planet.
I know that you are an actor, but please allow me to be the first one to say something you told me this morning. Allow me the privilege of being your reporter tonight. You told me as we got down from the rostrum that when you started to speak—after both of us made the speeches this morning to your country, to my country, and to the world that had wanted, perhaps, to listen to us—you said that you had in the pocket of your overcoat the speech you had pronounced for the Duke of Luxembourg and that you had not used this overcoat until today. My speech, you had it in the pocket of your jacket. So, today I was almost called ""Your Highness."" I certainly do not have any special ambitions to be royalty, but I just wonder, the faces of the Venezuelans if they had heard this. [Laughter]
Mr. President, allow me again to thank you for this beautiful reception, for your kindness, and also for having invited distinguished friends of yours, people you love, and friends of mine—people who are of great value and precious to my own country, Venezuela. And allow me to exemplify and identify all of these fellow countrymen of mine with the name of Marisol Escobar, a famous sculptress who forged the image of the liberator, Simon Bolivar, and left this image at the United Nations forever in time.
Thank you again, Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan. You have in me, be assured of the fact, a loyal and sincere friend who admires you, esteems you; a friend good enough to dissent with you and to applaud at the same time all your kindness, your good will, and your good heart.
Thank you.

Mr. President, Mrs. Kim, distinguished guests, 4 months ago the First Lady and I were deeply honored by the warm hospitality that the President and Mrs. Kim extended to us during our visit to Korea, including a memorable state dinner at Korea's Blue House. Tonight it is our pleasure to welcome President and Mrs. Kim to the first state dinner we've held here at the White House.
Mr. President, your leadership for democracy and your great personal sacrifice in the cause of democracy in Korea has been an inspiration to freedom-loving people around the world. And you have provided leadership, as well, for your country's remarkable economic performance which has made Korea a model for other nations. Terrain that once was bomb-scarred and war-ravaged today supports modern factories and new skyscrapers. In just 33 years, Korea's output has increased an astounding 100-fold.
The optimism and perseverance that have made South Korea great can also be found in abundance here in our Korean-American community. Over 1 million Korean-Americans today are contributing greatly to the dynamism of our American life. They are building bonds of cooperation across an ocean of opportunity, bonds that will serve our two nations well as we meet the many challenges that face us both in the years ahead.
For 43 years, Mr. President, America and Korea have stood shoulder to shoulder to preserve security on the peninsula. Today, new challenges such as North Korea's nuclear program continue to demand our vigilance and our determined effort. But they also demand that we demonstrate vision. You and I share a vision, Mr. President, a vision of a Korea at peace and one day reunited on terms acceptable to the Korean people.
During my visit to Korea in July, I was moved not only by the beauty of the ""Land of the Morning Calm"" but also by the spirit of the people. When I visited Seoul, I gained a better appreciation of the scope of Korea's economic success, the miracle on the Han. When I stood on the somber bridge at the Point of No Return, I gained a deeper appreciation for Korea's continuing security challenges. When I spoke to the National Assembly, I gained an inspiring appreciation of Korea's commitment to democracy. And when I went jogging with President Kim, I gained a fresh appreciation for the warmth, the vigor, and the endurance of Korea's leader.
President Kim, it is with great admiration for you and for the people of Korea that I invite everyone here to join me in a toast to you and to the Republic of Korea. May democracy continue to flourish there, and may the dream of peaceful reunification on the Korean Peninsula soon become a reality.
To President and Mrs. Kim and the people of the Republic of Korea. Hear, hear.

Gentlemen, this is an historical occasion. We have here tonight, Mr. President, what you might call enough representation to be the whole Government of the United States. You have the President, and the Vice President, the Speaker of the House who, according to my civic studies is supposed to be the second most powerful man in government--I don't know whether he is or not; and we have the Chief Justice of the United States, head of the greatest court in the world. We have the Cabinet all represented here. We have the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and the ranking Minority Member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who was Chairman of the 80th Congress. We have the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which starts the tax program in the United States. We have the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the House, who is the originator of appropriations for the operation of the Government of the United States. We have the minority Members of the House and Senate represented here.
And I think that the situation is so arranged that we can truthfully say that we are honoring the Republic of the Philippines. The Republic of the Philippines is something new in the history of the world. Never before--from Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Rome, to Great Britain and the Empire of the French--has it been the province-the privilege--of the most powerful nation in the world to create a Republic and donate to it sovereignty in its own right, until the Republic of the Philippines was created.
I have an extreme and very close interest in the Philippine Republic, for the simple reason that I happened to be--by the accident of death--President of the United States when the Republic of the Philippines was instituted on July 4, 1946.
It was my privilege to be acquainted with the first President of the Philippine Republic, and the second President of the Philippine Republic, and now we have the third President of the Republic of the Philippines, and the first official visit from a President of the Republic of the Philippines to the United States of America.
I want to offer a toast to the President of the Philippine Republic, and to wish for the complete and entire success of that great Republic.

President Reagan. If I'm late getting up here, I just had to finish the story. [Laughter]
President Zia, Begum Zia, distinguished guests, it's an honor for me to welcome you to the White House this evening.
Mr. President, our talks this morning underlined again the strong links between our countries. We find ourselves even more frequently in agreement on our goals and objectives. And we, for example, applaud your deep commitment to peaceful progress in the Middle East and South Asia, a resolve which bolsters our hopes and the hopes of millions.
In the last few years, in particular, your country has come to the forefront of the struggle to construct a framework for peace in your region, an undertaking which includes your strenuous efforts to bring peaceful resolution to the crisis in Afghanistan—a resolution which will enable the millions of refugees currently seeking shelter in Pakistan to go home in peace and honor. Further, you've worked to ensure that progress continues toward improving the relationship between Pakistan and India. And in all these efforts the United States has supported your objectives and will applaud your success.
A great intellectual forefather of Pakistan, Muhammed Iqbal, once said that, ""The secret of life is in the seeking."" Well, President Zia, today the people of the United States and Pakistan are seeking the same goals. Your commitment to peace and progress in South Asia and the Middle East has reinforced our commitment to Pakistan. We want to assure you, Mr. President, and the people of your country that we will not waver in this commitment.
Our relationship is deep and long-standing. It stretches back to Pakistan's first days of independence. It stretches forward as far as we can see. It's based on mutual interest, yes, but also on shared visions and goals in the world around us. It is based, as well, on the fact that the people of both our countries sincerely value the good relations and the affinity between us.
Our people already work together in significant ways through educational exchanges, tourism, economic cooperation, and through bonds of family and friendship. We have cooperative programs in science and technology and in agriculture, and we hope to explore with the Government of Pakistan various ways of enhancing cooperation.
Differences may come between our nations or have come between our nations in the past, but they've proven to be transitory while the ties which bind us together grow stronger year by year. As we welcome you here tonight as the representative of your country and its people, we can say with confidence that those ties will continue to grow stronger and that the good will which exists between our two countries will prove to be both true and lasting.
And, Mr. President, I propose a toast to you, to the people of Pakistan, and to the friendship that binds our nations together.
President Zia. In the name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful, we praise Him and we send blessings on His honored messenger.
Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
After hearing such an eloquent speech from—Mr. President, from you, and having had such a sumptuous—so well presented in such a fine company—a meal that I will perhaps cherish for many years to come, I see very little that I can add to what you have very kindly said. But still, Mr. President, my wife and I, as well as the members of my delegation, are most grateful to you, sir, for the honor you have done us in hosting this delightful banquet for us tonight. I have been deeply touched by the sentiments of your friendship that you have expressed towards me and my country, which are most warmly reciprocated.
Mr. President, the people of Pakistan are deeply committed to molding their lives and building their institutions in keeping with the dictates of Islam. Islam ordains upon—follows a belief in the equality and universal brotherhood of mankind. It was the dedication of your Founding Fathers, Mr. President, to similar ideals that created this great republic, the United States of America.
Mr. President, your country has been called the melting pot of people from all over the world. This is a trait we share with you, though, perhaps, on a very smaller scale. Let me therefore take you back to Pakistan, if I can.
Herein lies the Indus Valley, which is the heartland of Pakistan. This valley has been a veritable thoroughfare throughout history. Untold millions, representing all the major races of the Eurasian mass have made their way through our mountain passes to settle in or to pass through the Indus Valley. They came in all guises. They came as conquering hordes, as defeated or wandering tribes, as mystics and missionaries, as saints and sultans, and even as tourists and traders, both ancient and modern. And 35 years ago, Mr. President, many millions of Muslims of the South Asian subcontinent came together to help build a dream called Pakistan.
Thus we are indeed the heirs to a rich and a varied, if also somewhat turbulent historical heritage. But by the same token, we are a vigorous people with an innate feel for the movements of history.
And, Mr. President, unfortunately, a new and menacing turbulence has arisen in our region. More than a fifth of the entire population of Afghanistan has been compelled to seek shelter in Pakistan as a result of the armed intervention in that country by a foreign power. We are bending our effort to resolve this tragic situation through a peaceful political settlement, in accordance with the principles enunciated by the international community. The latest manifestation of this was the Resolution of Afghanistan adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, once again with the overwhelming support of the member states.
There are other turbulences in our region, Mr. President. The war between Iran and Iraq and the suffering recently visited upon the Lebanese and Palestinian people continue to cause us profound concern and anguish.
The situation calls for difficult yet courageous decisions. The most important of these is to find a just and a durable solution to the Palestinian problem, in accordance with the national rights of the Palestinian people. If I may be permitted, sir, to recall my words, it is for the first time that Arabs have put up a unified plan for the solution of the Palestine problem. To the best of my knowledge, it is for the first time that the President of the United States of America has put up a very comprehensive plan with some very positive elements in this.
Mr. President, knowing your humane qualities, knowing you as a man of God, knowing you as a man of peace, I urge you not to leave this opportunity that is coming your way. I request you to be yourself, to find the rest of you and take this bold step, because history will then remember you not only as Reagan of the United States of America but Reagan the Peacemaker, the Reagan who solved practically an insolvable problem. We in Pakistan, Mr. President, wish you to take this initiative, and we wish you all the best. And we will pray for your success.
Earlier today in our personal discussion and in the talks including our colleagues, I had an opportunity to discuss these and other issues with you. I'm deeply gratified by the manner in which you made clear your continuing and deep-felt interest in the welfare and prosperity of the people of Pakistan and your support for what we are doing for the sake of stability in our region.
In turn, Mr. President, I would like to assure you, sir, of our confidence that with your acknowledged qualities of human understanding and with the high principled tradition of your country behind you the United States will keep faith with its friends and well-wishers.
Mr. President, allow me to thank you also for what you have said, for what you have said about the continued relationship between Pakistan and the United States of America. We cherish this union of partners—though unequal partners—but as two sovereign states comprising of people who love each other, comprising of people who have love and regard for humanity, comprising of people who love peace. And, as you said about the United States of America, that if this country has been created, God must have ordained this to be a country of peace.
Spread this America, Mr. President, to areas other than the United States of America. Let America be the torchbearer of peace, peace not only on the American continent but peace in Afghanistan, peace in Vietnam, peace in Somalia, and above all, peace in Palestine. We wish you, sir, all the best in your endeavors. And you will never find Pakistanis faltering. We'll be there right behind you to give you the helping hand, if we can, at the moment that you wish us to do so.
With these words, may I request you, ladies and gentlemen, to join me in a toast to the health and happiness of President Reagan and his charming wife, Mrs. Nancy Reagan, the continued progress and prosperity of the people of the United States, the establishment of peace, stability, and justice throughout the world. To the health and happiness of all friends, ladies and gentlemen, who are present here tonight. And, finally, a continuing friendship between Pakistan and the United States of America. I thank you.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"May 19, 2010","
President Obama. Michelle and I are extraordinarily honored as we host you, but most importantly as we host President Calderon and First Lady Margarita Zavala. Yes, I'm sorry, please be seated. We welcome them and the Mexican delegation for our second state dinner here at the White House--tonight la Casa Blanca. [Laughter]
In our visit to Mexico, the President and First Lady have treated me and Michelle to a celebration of Mexico's rich heritage, including the stunning Anthropology Museum and some wonderful mariachi. Tonight we celebrate the bonds we share as neighbors and as friends.
We celebrate all that Mexico and its ancient civilizations have given the world throughout history, advances in architecture and astronomy, mathematics and medicine, and of course, some very good food--[Laughter]--including the ""food of the gods,"" chocolate. [Laughter]
As Mexico marks the bicentennial of its independence and the centennial of its revolution, we celebrate a proud people who have defined their own destiny, with patriots like Hidalgo and Juarez and giants in the arts and literature and science and, like the United States, a pretty good soccer team. [Laughter]
We celebrate all that Mexican Americans have contributed to the United States, leaders in every segment of our society, including many of the guests who are here tonight, and a culture that treasures family and faith. Indeed, America is enriched by el sabor de Mexico.
And we celebrate the partnership between our two countries. Mr. President, I must say it again: In the fight for your country's future, you've shown extraordinary courage, extraordinary bravery, and you and the Mexican people have a full and committed partner in the United States.
As we look to the future, I'm reminded of all the young people who've become part of our visits: the children in Mexico City waving American and Mexican flags; the students who shared their dreams with Michelle; and some very excited kids that, along with Michelle and Margarita, did a little exercise today. [Laughter] Each of those children has a dream. And yet we know that in life, it's not enough to want your dream. As the extraordinary writer Octavio Paz wrote in one of his poems, you must ""deserve your dream.""
And so, Mr. President, I propose a toast to the dreams of our children. Together, may we realize those dreams, and together, may we deserve them by going forward in partnership and respect.
Cheers. Salud.
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
President Calderon. So good evening. Your Excellency, Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, Mrs. Michelle Obama, ladies and gentlemen, I thank President Barack Obama and Michelle and also to the people from the United States of America for your invitation and the generous hospitality with which we have been welcomed during this visit.
Your courtesy, Mr. President, as that that we have received from the First Lady, honor the great friendship and partnership that brings our people together.
Today I have once again seen that we share the hope to turn this relationship between the people from the United States of America and the people from Mexico into an example of how much can be achieved among neighbors when working together under the guidance of common ideals such as peace, security, prosperity, freedom, and democracy.
Today we promote the agreements and the actions of cooperation that our countries need in order to face the new challenges to benefit fully of the enormous advantages as a result of being neighbors and the long borderline that unites us. Today, Mexico and the United States are immersed in a new stage of cooperation, and we based our efforts in the principles of shared responsibility, mutual respect, and trust.
We fully understand that our joint work has a direct impact in both populations in its well-being and happiness. We are neighbors, we are partners, we are allies, and we are also friends.
I have said this, and allow me to repeat it: We work with the certainty of what is good for the United States of America is good for Mexico, and if we understand this, at the same time, what is good for Mexico is good for the United States.
I would like to congratulate the people of the United States of America for having a President like President Barack Obama, with his leadership, which is also very positive and good for us, and at the same time, also congratulate you, Mr. President, for having a wife and a First Lady like Michelle Obama.
Thank you for your hospitality and your friendship.
[President Calderon continued in English, as follows.]
Mr. President, I like the phrase of Octavio Paz that one must deserve their dreams--or his dreams. I don't know if you and me deserve of dreams, but I know that both of you--both of us have dreams. Those dreams are related with our people, and we fight every day in order to deserve those dreams. And we will reach them.
[President Calderon continued in Spanish, and his remarks were translated as follows.]
I ask you now to raise your glasses in a toast for the happiness of both our great nations.
[President Calderon offered a toast.]

President Bush. Mr. President, thank you very much, sir, for your gracious and warm hospitality. Madam, thank you very much. Mr. President, thank you for coming back from Germany today. Laura and I are touched. This has been a spectacular trip. It's not over, because tomorrow we're going to tour more of your country.
President Kikwete. You'll be——
President Bush. I'll be—[laughter]. But I must say that our trip here has exceeded my expectations. I knew you were an accomplished Government. After all, you've dramatically reduced malaria; you're in the process of dramatically reducing HIV/ AIDS. My country has awarded you the largest Millennium Challenge grant ever in the history of our Nation, all because your Government is committed to honest, decent government for the people.
I have been extremely touched, as has Laura, by the outpouring of support by the great people of Tanzania. And so, Mr. President, I too would like to propose a toast: To you and your family, to the people of Tanzania, and to our friendship, may it be long lasting.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"April 28, 2014","
President Aquino. Please sit down. His Excellency, the Honorable President Obama; Vice President Jejomar Binay; former President Fidel Valdez Ramos, President Joseph Ejército Estrada; Senate President Franklin Drilon, Members of the Senate present; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr., and all our Members of the House present; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and the Justices of the Supreme Court; Secretary Albert Del Rosario, Secretary Paquito Ochoa, members of the Cabinet; Ambassador Joey Cuisia; Ambassador Philip Goldberg, Ambassador Susan Rice, Ambassador Michael Froman; Mr. Rob Nabors; Excellencies of the diplomatic corps; distinguished members of the U.S. delegation; honored guests; ladies and gentlemen: Good evening.
Mr. President, on behalf of the Filipino people, I welcome you and your delegation to the Philippines. Though your stay here in our country may be short, I hope that it will allow you to see and experience for yourself how, indeed, it is more fun in the Philippines and that, undoubtedly, the Philippines works.
Mr. President, the historic friendship between our peoples has been punctuated by visits from your predecessors. Your visit, the eighth by a U.S. President, has been a long time coming, and it marks yet another important chapter in our relations. Your presence here today reaffirms the strong bond between our nations. As a friend and partner of the Filipino people, Mr. President, you have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the growth and development of our nation.
It is only fitting, therefore, that your efforts be recognized with the conferment of the Order of Sikatuna. Since 1953, the highest recognition of diplomatic merit of the Republic of the Philippines has been the Order of Sikatuna. It is conferred on those who have fostered and elevated the bilateral partnership of our country with other nations.
Tonight I have the distinct pleasure to confer the highest rank, that of Raja, or Grand Collar, on you, Mr. President, for your leadership and policies that assisted the Philippines in times of natural disaster, for helping uphold stability and peace by means of the rule of law in Southeast Asia, and for working with us to fundamentally raise the defense capacity of our country.
[At this point, President Aquino's aides displayed the medal for President Obama.]
President Obama. Thank you.
President Aquino. Congratulations!
The first of your predecessors to receive this distinction was Venerable Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960. Then as now, may this conferment symbolize our nation's esteem for the American people and may serve as a reminder of the mutual desire to always be partners based on the highest principles of liberty, democracy and progress.
Mr. President, our discussions today highlighted the ongoing dialogue and cooperation between our two countries as we adapt and respond to the changing circumstances and the paramount challenges of the 21st century. The world has come to realize that stability is a necessary foundation of progress and prosperity for all our peoples. Alliances are deepened not only through our shared history, but also through mutual confidence and respect, which is constantly refreshed to give new relevance and purpose to our positive, longstanding relations.
We are bound by the quest to turn our shared principles of democracy, human rights, and freedom into an inclusive reality not just for our respective peoples, but for all nations.
Mr. President, I've always taken to heart that in an increasingly complex world, it is incumbent upon all of us to be part of the solution and not of the problem. From the very first meeting we had in New York in 2010 to this night, you and I—and the members of our respective administrations—have worked together as partners and friends, finding ways to promote common understanding and to develop meaningful solutions to a great number of our era's dilemmas.
Whether in strengthening our trade relations, security alliances, and people-to-people engagements or encouraging more nations to commit to the Open Government Partnership, an area where the Philippines continues to innovate, we continue to challenge ourselves to answer the pressing questions of these times: By what means can be—can peace be sustained? Through what instruments can poverty and the effects of climate change and calamity be addressed? And to whose benefit will our mutual and collective undertakings redound?
The answer, of course, lies in the maintenance and deepening of the alliance we share, whether in building a Southeast Asia that champions the rule of law or in advancing the belief that the most certain way to prosperity is to actively seek a harmonious relationship with all nations.
Mr. President, through this brief visit of yours, I am confident that you have witnessed firsthand how such values, our shared beliefs and principles, can transform a society as it has ours.
On this note, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, please rise as I propose a toast. To the good health, happiness, and success of our dear friend President Obama and his family, to the continuing closeness and affection between Filipinos and Americans, and to the realization of our common vision of a more stable, more prosperous, and more inclusive international community.
[A toast was offered.]
President. We say ""buhay.""
President Obama. Buhay. Cheers.
Well, thank you so much. Magandang gabi. [Laughter] President Aquino, distinguished guests, on behalf of my delegation and myself, I want to thank you for the magnificent welcome today and thank you for your gracious hospitality this evening.
Mr. President, I am deeply honored to receive the Order of the Sikatuna. I accept it in the spirit in which it has been bestowed, with a commitment to continuing to deepen the bonds between our two great nations.
To all the gentlemen here this evening, you look very good, but I think you'll agree that the women outshine you in the vibrant colors of the Philippines. [Laughter] I have only been here 1 day, but the kindness that you've shown me and the extraordinary hospitality that's been extended to us leaves us with very warm feelings and reflects, I think, the legendary spirit of the Filipino people. I'm told that you have a word to describe this, the inner feeling, that core of a person's being: kalooban. [Laughter] We see this spirit in a family that's given itself to this country. There is no greater nobility than offering one's life to the nation and, Mr. President, your father offered his life so that this nation might be free. Your mother and the citizens of this great nation who took to the streets showed the world that true power lies with people. And with the canonization of Pope John Paul II, we also honor the role that the Catholic Church played in supporting the Filipino people and their desire for freedom.
Noynoy, you bear the scars of those who would have taken this nation backwards. And you carry on your family's noble tradition of service, in your commitment to the dignity and prosperity of the Filipino people.
We also see the spirit of this nation in all that you have overcome: colonialism and occupation, invasion and the dictatorship. Yours is a fierce independence, won through sacrifice and renewed with each generation. And we saw that again this year. After Yolanda, America grieved with you and stood with you. But we were also inspired by your resilience and your determination to care for those who had been affected.
Tonight our hearts actually grieve for some of our fellow Americans back home who have been devastated by very terrible storms and tornadoes, but we draw strength from your example. For even as we grieve, we know that we will recover and we will rebuild in these communities that have been affected because people will care after each other.
You bring that same strength and solidarity to our alliance. So let me say tonight on behalf of the American people: We are honored and proud to call you an ally and a friend. Through our treaty alliance, the United States has an ironclad commitment to defend you, your security, and your independence.
And finally, we feel our spirit—our kalooban—in the friendship between our peoples that expresses itself in so many ways. There's our mutual obsession with basketball. [Laughter] There's our mutual admiration for Manny Pacquiao—[laughter]—even if sometimes, he's fighting against Americans, and it doesn't turn out the way we'd like. [Laughter]
There's our shared pride in the millions of Filipino Americans who contribute to our Nation every single day. There's one in particular I'm grateful for: Cris Comerford, our Executive Chef at the White House. Cris was born in Manila. She still has family here. Thanks to her, we in the White House enjoy the occasional lumpia and adobo. [Laughter]
So I want to propose a toast: To our gracious host, President Aquino; to the alliance that keeps us strong and free; and to the friendship between our peoples, may it always endure, across the ocean and in our hearts.
Mabuhay.
[A toast was offered.]
President Obama. Cheers.
"
state-dinners,Barack Obama,"March 14, 2012","
President Obama. Good evening, everyone. Please have a seat. Welcome to the White House. I was just telling the Prime Minister that, so far, the evening has been successful because I have not stepped on Michelle's train--[laughter]--my main goal this evening. Michelle and I could not be more honored that you could join us as we host our great friends the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, and his remarkable wife Samantha. You can give them a round of applause. Why not?
As I said this morning, this visit also gives us an opportunity to return the gracious hospitality that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth as well as David and Samantha and all the British people showed us during our visit to London last year. And I know Michelle looks forward to returning, because, as she announced yesterday, she will be leading the U.S. delegation to the opening ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in London. I am jealous. [Laughter]
Now, I'm so grateful for all the time that David and I have had together. But as we've learned, you can never tell how things will get reported as a consequence of our interactions. When we met 2 years ago, we exchanged beers from our hometowns. One newsstory said: ""David Cameron and Barack Obama cemented their special relationship by hitting the bottle."" [Laughter]
When we had a barbecue at Downing Street for some of our servicemembers, David and I rolled up our sleeves, threw away the aprons, decided to flip the burgers ourselves. One reporter called it a ""brave and foolish move."" [Laughter] Another expressed amazement at our ""surprising competence."" [Laughter] Michelle and Samantha often remark the same way. [Laughter]
And finally, when David and I got beat pretty badly in table tennis by some local London kids, one newspaper asked the head coach of the British Olympic women's team to critique our performance. Obama, the coach said, ""talked a lot."" [Laughter] David ""overhits the ball."" [Laughter] Both of them--I'm quoting here--""looked a little confused."" [Laughter]
But in moments like that and in all of our interactions, including today, I've learned something about David. In good times and in bad, he's just the kind of partner that you want at your side. I trust him. He says what he does, and he does what he says. And I've seen his character. And I've seen his commitment to human dignity during Libya. I've seen his resolve, his determination to get the job done, whether it's righting our economies or succeeding in Afghanistan.
And I will say something else, David: All of us have seen how you, as a parent, along with Samantha, have shown a measure of strength that few of us will ever know. Tonight I thank you for bringing that same strength and solidarity to our partnership, even if you do overhit the ball. [Laughter]
We are by no means the first President and Prime Minister to celebrate the deep and abiding bonds between our people. There has been no shortage of words uttered about our special relationship. And as--and I was humbled to offer my own last year when I had the opportunity to address Parliament in Westminster Hall.
So, rather than words, I'd like to leave you tonight with two simple images. They're from different times and places, decades apart. But they're moments, I think, that reveal the spirit of our alliance and the character of our countries.
The first is from the Blitz, when, month after month, the British people braved the onslaught from the sky. And one of those most enduring images from those days is of the London skyline, covered in smoke, with one thing shining through: the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, tall and proud and strong. The other image we know from our own lives, from that awful September day, that unforgettable picture of the Manhattan skyline, covered in smoke and dust, with one thing shining through: our Statue of Liberty, tall and proud and strong.
In those two moments, I think you see all you need to know about who we are and what brings us together tonight. In war and in peace, in times of plenty and times of hardship, we stand tall and proud and strong together. And as free peoples committed to the dignity of all human beings, we will never apologize for our way of life, nor waver in its defense.
It's why David's grandfather fought alongside us Yanks after D-day, why my grandfather marched across Europe in Patton's army. It's why tonight, at dusty bases in Afghanistan, both American and British soldiers are getting ready to go on patrol, like generations before them, shoulder to shoulder. It's why our diplomats and development workers are side by side, standing with the activists who dare to demand their rights, save a child from drought or famine.
It's why leaders of our two countries can embrace the same shared heritage and the promise of our alliance, even if we come from different political traditions, even if the Prime Minister is younger than nearly 200 years of his predecessors, even if the President looks a little different than his predecessors. And, David, it's why tonight our young children, and children across our countries, can sleep well, knowing that we're doing everything in our power to build a future that is worthy of their dreams.
So, in closing, let me just say that I intended to make history tonight. I thought that I could be the first American President to make it through an entire visit of our British friends without quoting Winston Churchill. [Laughter] But then I saw this great quote, and I thought, ""Come on, this is Churchill!"" [Laughter] So I couldn't resist.
It was December 1941, and the attack on Pearl Harbor had finally thrust America into war, alongside our British friends. And these were the words Sir Winston spoke to his new American partners: ""I will say that he must indeed have a blind soul who cannot see that some great purpose and design is being worked out here below, of which we have the honor to be the faithful servants.""
And so I'd like to propose a toast: To Her Majesty the Queen, on her Diamond Jubilee, to our dear friends David and Samantha, and to the great purpose and design of our alliance. May we remain, now and always, its faithful servants. Cheers, everyone.
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
David.
Prime Minister Cameron. President Obama, First Lady, ladies and gentlemen: It is a tremendous honor to be here this evening. And I want to thank you for putting on such a great dinner and for making our visit so special over the last 2 days. And thank you also for those strong and beautiful words that you've just spoken.
Now, Michelle, I'm sure that, like Sam, you often wonder what happens when your husband goes for a night out with the guys. [Laughter] So maybe I should come clean about last night. [Laughter] We went to basketball, and we had a real man-to-man chat. Barack tried to confuse me by talking about bracketology--[laughter]--but I got my own back by running him gently through the rules of cricket. [Laughter]
The truth is, we have to have a guys' night out because so often we find we are completely overshadowed by our beautiful wives.
As I rolled into bed last night, I said, ""Samantha, do you want to hear about what I got up to on this great guys' night out?"" And she--she's not too impressed by these things. She said: ""Well, everything you did was on television. You were surrounded by the Presidential bodyguard, so presumably, you didn't get up to anything."" [Laughter]
Now, both Barack and I have said a lot today about the importance of the relationship between our two countries and our peoples. Like my predecessors, I'm proud of our essential relationship and of Britain's strong national bond with the United States of America. I feel it in my bones.
Now, there is, of course, a great history of close relationships between U.S. Presidents and British Prime Ministers. Importantly, these have been regardless of the political parties they happen to represent. Her Majesty the Queen is a great authority on the matter. She has seen--and she likes to tell me this--no fewer than 12 British Prime Ministers and 11 American Presidents during her time on the throne. And I'm sure everyone here would want to pay tribute to her incredible service and selfless duty in this, her special Diamond Jubilee year.
Now, Her Majesty's first Prime Minister was, of course, Winston Churchill, a regular guest here at the White House. I'm not going to quote from Churchill, I'm going to quote about Churchill, because it seems his visits were not always the easiest experience for his American hosts.
As Roosevelt's secretary wrote after one visit: ""Churchill is a trying guest. He drinks like a fish. He smokes like a chimney. He has irregular routines, works nights, sleeps days, and turns the clocks upside down."" And for those of you who wonder why the British Prime Minister now stays at Blair House rather than the White House--[laughter]--I simply observe this. We all know the story of Winston Churchill famously found naked in his bath by President Roosevelt. This happened while he stayed at the White House in December 1941, and the Federal Government bought Blair House in 1942. [Laughter]
Now, for every genuine Presidential-Prime Ministerial friendship, there have been some--I think we could call them--total disconnects. Edward Heath and Richard Nixon took personal awkwardness with each other to new and excruciating levels. [Laughter] And yet, despite this, Richard Nixon arranged for someone to pay for the swimming pool at the Prime Minister's country residence of Chequers. Incidentally, this swimming pool now has a serious and possibly terminal leak. [Laughter] So I hope you won't find it amiss as I say here in the White House, for the first time in 40 years, these words: It is time to call in the plumbers. [Laughter]
Now, turning to Obama-Cameron, as fellow parents, Barack and Michelle have both been personally very kind to Sam and me. And as fellow leaders, we've struck up, I believe, a really good partnership. It is frank and honest. We talk through issues very rationally. We don't need to remind each other of the basic threats that we face; we know them. But there are three things about Barack that really stand out for me: strength, moral authority, and wisdom.
Strength, because Barack has been strong when required to defend his national interests. Under President Obama's leadership, America got bin Laden. And together with British and coalition forces, America has fundamentally weakened Al Qaida. The President says what he will do, and he sticks to it. I'll never forget that phone call on Libya, when he told me exactly what role America would play in Libya, and he delivered his side of the bargain to the letter. We delivered our side of the bargain too. And let us all agree that the world is better off without bin Laden, but the world is better off without Qaddafi too.
Moral authority, because Barack understands that the means matter every bit as much as the ends. Yes, America must do the right thing, but to provide moral leadership, America must do it in the right way too. The first President I studied at school was Theodore Roosevelt. He talked of speaking softly and carrying a big stick. That is Barack's approach. And in following it, he has pressed the reset button on the moral authority of the entire free world.
Wisdom, because Barack has not rushed into picking fights, but has stewarded America's resources of hard and soft power. He's taken time to make considered decisions, drawing down troops from Iraq and surging in Afghanistan. He's found a new voice for America with the Arab people. And at home, he's recognized that in America, as in Britain, the future depends on making the best of every citizen. Both our nations have historically been held back by inequality. But now there's a determined effort in both our countries--most notably through education reform--to ensure that opportunity is truly available for all.
Half a century ago, the amazing courage of Rosa Parks, the visionary leadership of Martin Luther King, and the inspirational actions of the civil rights movement led politicians to write equality into the law and make real the promise of America for all her citizens. But in the fight for justice and the struggle for freedom, there is no end, because there is so much more to do to ensure that every human being can fulfill their potential.
That is why our generation faces a new civil rights struggle, to seek the prize of a future that is open to every child as never before. Barack has made this one of the goals of his Presidency, a goal he's pursuing with enormous courage. And it is fitting that a man whose own personal journey defines the promise and potential of this unique nation should be working to fulfill the hopes of his country in this way.
Barack, it is an honor to call you an ally, a partner, and a friend. You don't get to choose the circumstances you have to deal with as a President or a Prime Minister. And you don't get to choose the leaders that you have to work with. But all I can say is that it is a pleasure to work with someone with moral strength, with clear reason, and with fundamental decency in this task of renewing our great national alliance for today and for the generations to follow.
And with that, I propose a toast: To the President, to the First Lady, and to the people of the United States of America. Cheers.

The President. Mr. Prime Minister and His Eminence Cardinal Szoka and distinguished guests and friends of Poland, Barbara and I are delighted to host this dinner tonight and, as I said this morning on the lawn of the White House, to return in some small measure the warm hospitality that we felt on our visits to Poland.
On our last visit this past July, that warm hospitality was coupled with a heat wave in Warsaw -- ninety degrees. Would have done Washington proud last week. [Laughter] But everywhere we went, Barbara and I felt right at home. I don't want to inject a partisan political note into this lovely nonpartisan evening, but at one point, Barbara even saw one fellow in the square at Gdansk wearing a Bush-Quayle '88 T-shirt. [Laughter] I know I shouldn't have mentioned that.
But I do remember my first visit to your country, Mr. Prime Minister, in the fall of 1987. Solidarity, Solidarnosc, was outlawed, underground, but still very much alive. And I remember well meeting with members of Solidarity. And afterward, as I rode to lay a wreath at the grave of Father Popieluszko, the murdered priest, in protest the state security agents removed the Polish flag from our car. But that was in 1987.
And 2 years later I went back to Poland in the summer of 1989, and I thought back to that first visit, about that incident with that red and white Polish flag. As I was riding through Gdansk, Solidarity's birthplace, to the Monument of the Three Crosses, thousands of Poles lined the streets, in their hands thousands of American flags and, of course, the red and white of Poland, your national flag, and the banner of Solidarnosc, high above the crowd.
What a world of change in those 2 years. On that first visit in 1987, everywhere undeniable determination, but just as undeniable, deep anxiety over the fate of Solidarity and the future of Poland. And on my return this past summer, on the eve of the Revolution of '89, everywhere we found a feeling of hope -- a feeling that Poland once more held its destiny in its hand, that the time had come once more for Poland to live in freedom, for Europe to be whole and free.
Mr. Prime Minister, I assure you all Americans agree that Poland's time has come, and all our prayers are with you at this time of Poland's rebirth.
Our meetings this morning accomplished a great deal. I found a wonderful frankness. We spoke from the heart, in candor, I felt, as friends. And tonight, Mr. Prime Minister, I offer this toast to old and enduring friends, the nations of Poland and America; to the future of a free Poland. And to you, sir, Mr. Prime Minister, let me return the kind wish that your countrymen made me in the Hall of the Sejm, in the streets of Warsaw, and the square of Gdansk: Sto lat, may you live 100 years.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President; esteemed Mrs. Bush; your Eminence, Cardinal; ladies and gentlemen, I would also prefer to refrain from talking politics here. But I will have to speak something about politics, and please forgive me for that.
Allow me to invoke here a classical piece on modern democracy, which is at the same time a classical work on America. It is a book by Alexis de Tocqueville. De Tocqueville referred to the unstoppable march of democracy; it was 150 years ago. Nowadays, we're witnessing an enormous acceleration of that march in Nicaragua, Chile, even Mongolia, but most of all in Eastern and Central Europe.
Democracy is a system which secures the freedom of the individual, the freedom without which no normal life is possible. Indeed, it has just been that deeply rooted need of normal life which has most strongly inspired the march observed in your country so many years ago by the famous Frenchman. It is also just to that need that, under the pressure of Eastern and Central European nations, totalitarianism is giving way -- the disease of our century which had devoured tens of millions of human lives, forcing hundreds of millions of others into a dead end history for many years. We in Poland are now emerging from a long night of totalitarian oppression.
In 1939 we were ravaged by the Nazi invasion. Our people suffered more than any other on Earth. Poland lost 6 million of its citizens, half of them Polish Jews. The Third Reich was crushed, and the war ended, but to our part of Europe, peace failed to bring an order based on freedom. For the next 45 years, we were forced to live under an alien political system, a totalitarian one which was imposed on the whole Eastern and Central Europe. The Poles never accepted their fate and were the first to challenge it. They succeeded in defending peasant homesteads, churches, and their own families against the greed of the totalitarian state, even through the most difficult times. The struggle by the Polish people to preserve their dignity and franchisement played a great role in sparking the change which today has gained such momentum.
Just as we stood in the forefront of struggle, so today we wish to be in the forefront in establishing the rights and institutions of a stable, democratic order. We're making Poland a state of the rule of law, which guarantees all political freedoms to its citizens. We're building a free-market economy based on free enterprise. It is a program which calls for great sacrifices. Polish people are aware of it. We know that our economy needs to be repaired by our own effort. And so, now that this effort has been undertaken, we have the moral right to seek the support of other countries.
Today Poland enjoys such support, and I am confident that it will continue. A great share of it has come from the United States -- the American Congress and personally yourself, Mr. President. Allow me to thank you for that.
Ladies and gentlemen, the changes in the Eastern and Central Europe are making the situation across the whole continent essentially different. The era of Yalta is becoming history. A need is emerging for a new structure which would operate within the parity of powers to gradually free Europe of military rivalry and bring the two separated parts closer together. Such a structure needs to be based on a solid foundation. Reconciliation between nations is possible only when they do not fear either for their present or their future. For this reason, an important component of the building must be the recognition of the Polish border along the Oder and Nysa Rivers in the form of a treaty. The direct participation in the talks about that, for Poland, was a very important matter for Poland; and it has already been guaranteed.
To create a new political facet of Europe is going to be a difficult challenge, and one calling for time and an enormous amount of work. A variety of ideas emerging, in this respect, need to become ripe, which in turn requires certain conditions. In our view, a helpful factor would be to form the Council for European Cooperation. Its job would not be to replace any of the existing organizations: it would serve as a platform whereby, within the CSC framework, work might be launched to give the ideas a concrete form. One can hardly imagine such work without a significant role on the part of the United States. After all, your country is linked to Europe by bonds of blood and by experiences of history.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, after General Sikorsky visited the White House in 1943, mine is only the second-ever call by a Polish Prime Minister here. How different the circumstances and how different, I believe, the perspectives of this period in history. I would like the United States to view Poland as one of the important actors of the present-day European politics. A strong Poland engaged in building a democratic order and freed of economic difficulties will be a stable factor of the new European order, an order based on freedom, respect of human rights, and economic and political balance on the Continent. I trust that the United States, with so many of its people linked to Poland by their origin and with the affection for Poland so much alive, will see a friend in the democratic, strong, and economically sound Poland.
Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to raise in a moment a toast to the good health and the well-being of the President of the United States.
I raise this toast also to the good health of Mrs. Barbara Bush. I wish you strength and perseverance in your difficult role here. It is well-known that the house, even if it's called White, becomes a home only upon the touch of a woman. I know how much Americans like you, and I want to tell you that so do the Poles.
I raise this toast, also, to the well-being of your great country and the millions of its citizens, as well as to our friendship, which at the Polish end has for long been extremely profound.
I raise this toast to you, Mr. President.

state-dinners,George W. Bush,"September 20, 2008","
Mr. President, members of your delegation, members of my Cabinet, Members of the United States Senate and United States Congress, honored guests: Welcome to the White House. Laura and I are really pleased you all are here. Our nations share a faith in liberty, a willingness to defend it, and a confidence that freedom will define the future for our region. The American people, Mr. President, are proud to call the Colombian people our friends and our allies.
You, Mr. President, are a strong leader. You and your Government and the Colombian people have shown courage in freedom's cause by taking on the terrorists and the drug lords. This summer, our Nation was impressed by the daring rescue of 15 hostages, 3 of whom were American citizens. We appreciate your leadership. We are pleased to be your partner in strengthening the rule of law and combating the illegal drug trade and helping victims of violence rebuild their lives and communities.
We're also partners in the spread of prosperity. We have negotiated a fair free trade agreement that will benefit families and businesses in both our nations. And I appreciate your strong advocacy for this agreement. And my sincere hope is that the United States Congress will pass the Colombia free trade agreement as soon as possible.
Mr. President, Laura and I warmly remember our visits to your beautiful country. We were honored to visit a city liberated by the great Simon Bolivar. And in that visit we were honored to be with you and your lovely wife.
And so tonight I want to propose a toast to our friendship, the friendship between our countries. May God bless Colombia, and may God bless the United States.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"July 26, 1969","
President Marcos, Mrs. Marcos, all the distinguished guests at this very distinguished dinner tonight:
I first wish to express, on behalf of all of us who are here as your guests, our appreciation for this dinner, and for the opportunity to be with you on such an historic occasion.
You have spoken most eloquently, Mr. President, about the accomplishment of the moon landing. I would only want to be sure that we all recognize that what happened there belongs not just to the three men who were in the vehicle and the two who set foot on the moon, or even to those who had preceded them in the Apollo missions, nor did it belong alone to the American people, because nations around the world participated.
I know, too, that the hopes and the prayers of the people in nations all over the world went with those first men from earth to land on the moon.
I know that as we drove through the streets of Manila today, the first capital we have visited since that landing occurred, that the unprecedented size of that welcome and the wonderful warmth that we felt in that crowd was in great part due to the fact that the people of the Philippines, too, shared in that moon venture, and their prayers and their hopes went with our astronauts. We are most grateful for those hopes and those prayers as they were rendered.
As I met those--at least some of those-who are here at this head table tonight, I realized how many years my own experience in the Philippines covered, because of those who have served as President of this country, several are here, and I have had the opportunity to think back to the other visits that we have had.
The first was in 1953, the next in 1956-when we were present with President Magsaysay1 at the 10th anniversary of the independence for the Philippines, and a crowd of three-quarters of a million people were gathered in what is now Rizal Park, and then as a private citizen in 1964, and then in 1966 and 1967 and, finally, today, I return again.
This is the first time I have been here as President of the United States, but to give you an indication of what I feel about this country, what I remember is-whether I came as Vice President or as private citizen--the welcome was just as warm as it was when I was President of the United States. For that I am grateful.
I suppose that tells us something about the relations between our two countries, relations of which you have spoken so warmly.
We do have ties that go back over many years. We have fought together in war; we have worked together in peace. Today we look to the future realizing that what we do together will have a great effect not only on our two nations, but on the future of peace and freedom in Asia and in the world.
In that respect, I would like to refer just briefly to the time which your career, Mr. President, has spanned, and my own as well, although I am a bit older than you.
You served in World War II, as I did. Since that time we have seen in one generation World War II and two smaller wars, one in Korea and now one in Vietnam--all of them affecting Asia. We trust that the war in Vietnam can be brought to a successful conclusion. When that time comes, it will then be our opportunity to see what statesmanship can produce for the next quarter of a century.
Now I happen to be an optimist, an optimist in one sense, indicated by this moon landing. When I planned this trip, I planned it on the basis that we would take off immediately after the splashdown for a trip around the world. I was asked by some friends if we had any contingency plans in the event that the landing failed. I want you to know we had no contingency plans. We had faith that it would succeed.
But looking to the future, and what it means to all of us, I realize, as all of us in this room realize, that if war is to come, it is most likely to come again from the Pacific and from Asia in the last third of this century. But the other side of that rather pessimistic outlook is that if peace is to come, it must come primarily from the initiatives of those who live in Asia and from the United States, because we who live on the rim of the Pacific have within our hands the power to avoid another war in Asia, to bring peace, and, if we have that peace, then we can see the exciting possibilities for progress in this last third of a century.
Population will double. But, more than that, the development of the resources that we will see in a time of peace can mean progress such as men have never dreamed of before.
It is this dream--this dream of what peace in the Pacific, peace in Asia, can really be--it is this dream for which we are all living today.
When we think of the Philippines and the United States, of the wars through which we have lived, of the trials that we have had, of the progress that we have made, I think we all realize in this room that we stand now at the beginning of what could be a new era, a new era in which peace will come, as it will come, to Asia and the Pacific, and, therefore, to the world. And then we shall be able to keep that peace and have the progress that we all want, not only for ourselves but for our children in this very exciting period, a period in which we explore not just the earth, but the heavens-and by exploring the heavens we learn better how to develop the resources on earth--a period in which we learn to live together in progress and live together in peace as you have already described.
I would not want this evening to end without also paying tribute to one other at this table who has indicated the great power in this country of what we have learned in the United States: the power of the wife of a political man in the field of politics.
I can only say that Mrs. Nixon spent the afternoon with Mrs. Marcos. She had read, as I have, about her various achievements--the volunteer activities in which she has worked. And without becoming involved in what I know is an upcoming political campaign, all that I can say is this: After having spoken to Mrs. Marcos tonight, knowing of how she has campaigned with her husband, if I am ever in a campaign, I don't want her on the other side. [Laughter]
And if I may be permitted a self-serving statement, I never want my wife on the other side in a campaign either. [Laughter]
Here I pay tribute to all the women in this room--all who have worked with their husbands in helping them in their careers. Too often the men make the speeches and take the bows where the women should have the credit.
Tonight, let us be sure that we all recognize how important in our lives those who are 'the women in this room have been in helping us to whatever successes we have had.
One final point: When Mrs. Marcos visited the United States in May of 1968, in her party was a young Filipino who indicated a great interest in our space program and a great knowledge of it. As a result, the Protocol Department of the State Department sent him with an escort down to Cape Kennedy to evaluate the space program and have an opportunity to see how it was working.
After he looked it over, he said that he would like to put in a request to be the first Filipino to go to the moon.
I, tonight, have an announcement to make. That announcement is that on the first vehicle that carries passengers that goes to the moon, Bong Bong will be on that space vehicle. [Laughter and applause]
This is just to make it official: Here he is.
If, because of age, he will not be able to go to the moon, maybe we can have him go on the first vehicle to Mars.
Tonight, my friends, in the spirit of all that has been said tonight, let me ask you to join me in raising your glasses to the friendship of our two countries, the Philippine and the American people, and to the parents of Bong Bong--President and Mrs. Marcos.
"
state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"May 22, 2000","
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House. And let me say a special word of welcome to President and Mrs. Mbeki and the South African delegation.
In 1966 Robert Kennedy began a famous speech to the students at Cape Town by describing his deep interest in a land settled by the Dutch in the mid 17th century, then taken over by the British before finally becoming independent, a land with complicated and cruel racial problems dating back centuries, a land of untamed frontiers alongside a proud history of entrepreneurial achievement. He said, ""I refer, of course, to the United States of America."" [Laughter]
Obviously, in 1966 and in 2000, a great deal unites South Africa and the United States. We share a fundamental sense, dating back to our earliest struggles, continuing through our most recent ones, that nationhood is more than an inheritance; it is a living gift to be protected, defended, and redefined every day.
Few nations have worked harder at nationhood or achieved more impressive results than South Africa. Few leaders have given more of themselves to the struggle than Thabo Mbeki. His mother says that even when he was a small child, he used to get terribly excited whenever news broadcasts came over the radio. If only we could replicate that today. [Laughter]
When his father was in prison, alongside Nelson Mandela, in the early 1960's, Thabo Mbeki carried on the struggle from England. At the tender age of 21, he delivered a powerful appeal for his father's life in which he mentioned, as an aside, the fact that his father's birthday was the Fourth of July, 1910. Even though the United States was not exactly supporting the ANC in 1964, he saw that day, nevertheless, as a symbol of freedom and all the more reason his father should not lose his life for affirming the simple truth that all people are created equal.
Fortunately, Thabo Mbeki won that campaign, as he has won so many since. And South Africa's resurgence has given the entire world something to feel proud of. Today we talk about how best to deliver on its promise, how to deepen the friendship between our nations. I have already thanked President Mbeki for his strong support for peacekeeping and his ongoing leadership throughout the continent. I pledged to him that we would work harder to hasten the return of peace in troubled parts of Africa and that we would do more to build the prosperity needed to make conflict and disease less likely.
So many people who are here tonight, Mr. President, Mrs. Mbeki, contributed to the landmark legislation I signed last week to expand our trade with Africa and the Caribbean. Now we need to keep the momentum going to support the Africans who are working and fighting for peace, to relieve the debt of the poorest nations so they can devote their resources to basic human needs, to find cures and treatments and preventive strategies for the diseases ravaging the continent.
With echoes of John Donne, President Mbeki once said we have to address the problems of other peoples, because ""each one of us is a particle of the complete whole."" A South African poet, Mongane Wally Serote, recently wrote a poem entitled ""Come hope with me."" As you might imagine, I sort of liked it. [Laughter] In the poem, he urges people never to forget, ""life is a promise, and that promise is us.""
Tonight I ask you to join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Mbeki, to the people of South Africa and the promise of South Africa, the promise that will always join our two peoples.
"
state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"July 14, 1978","
Mr. President, Chancellor Schmidt, distinguished members of the government, economic society of the Federal Republic of Germany, ladies and gentlemen, my friends:
We who have come from Washington to visit your great country know that we are among friends. I want to express my deep appreciation for the generous reception that all of you have given to us and to offer my thanks to the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany who have greeted us so warmly.
It's a pleasure to begin my first visit to the Federal Republic as President in the city that nurtured Beethoven—a symbol not only of German culture but also of the indomitable spirit of a free people. There are two great musicians that I have admired in Germany—Ludwig von Beethoven and President Scheel. [Laughter]
But Bonn is equally significant in the contemporary role as the capital of this great and vibrant nation. The political and economic development of Western Europe since World War II is one of the greatest success stories in modem history.
""Thy"" apostrophizing ""Joy"" or ""Freedom"" in this poem. [Printed in the transcript.]
Mass poverty has been replaced by mass prosperity. Century-old enemies have become political and economic allies and are together building the future of Europe.
And here in Germany you have established and maintained a strong and a stable democracy. As the capital of West Germany, Bonn symbolizes the will and the determination of free people. You are a model in a livable world—a world we can manage, a world we can afford, a world we can enjoy.
Here in this peaceful young capital in the shadow of Siebengebirge, it is possible to envision a day when all nations will have revitalized cities surrounded by rural plenty, a day when all nations will cherish freedom, will understand the function of dissent in a free society, and offer their citizens the right to share in making the decisions that affect their own lives.
As I drove through Bonn today, I saw superbly restored old buildings standing proudly beside splendid new structures. I think this growing capital city that you enjoy is as strong a testimony to the vitality of modern Germany as your remarkable deutsche mark.
The United States is very proud of its long and intimate association with West Germany. We have watched with admiration-sometimes with envy—as you became one of the outstanding economies and the outstanding trading countries of the entire world.
For the last two decades, your economy has provided a powerful stimulus for the growth in Europe. Your policies are consistently among the most constructive on the Continent, indeed, the entire world. And you play an essential role in the developing economic strength of the global economy. They are even more impressive-your policies are—in the context of your commitment to a tree market system and the ideals of a free society.
That commitment is even more significant at a time when terrorist groups wrongly believe that they can force free societies to abandon our liberties. Our two nations are steadfast in our resolve to end the menace of terrorism and in our resolute conviction that democratic liberty and social justice are the best answers to terrorist threats. The application of civil protections in your exemplary basic law is ample evidence of the Federal Republic's devotion to these libertarian ideals.
The affinity between the Federal Republic and the United States goes well beyond our own bilateral interests, even well beyond those of the Atlantic community.
Our nations understand the moral force of democracy. This is the fundamental strength of the German-American partnership. Our peoples 'understand the meaning of fair access to opportunity and just reward. These shared convictions help us to face our problems in a spirit of cooperation. They give us the tools and the confidence to meet the challenges, difficult challenges of a modern society.
Our agenda—and the agenda for all democracies—includes a renewed commitment to global economic well-being. This, more than any other material goal, promises a future in keeping with the age-old yearnings of mankind: an end to inequities among nations, as well as among classes of citizens; a day when an interdependent world of trade and commerce can generate an adequate number of jobs, better income, and a better life in the poor two-thirds of the world; a day when the continuing transfer of capital and technology from rich to poorer countries will have spread the benefits of the industrialized nations throughout the underdeveloped world.
This transfer of funds and services is just as important to our own economic health as it is to the well-being of the lessdeveloped countries. In 2 days, Chancellor Schmidt and I will sit down with our colleagues from the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, Japan, and the European Commission to develop strategies to achieve the goals which I have just outlined. This will be the fourth economic summit conference, and I approach it with optimism.
Although we have not achieved all we had hoped in the 14 months since the last summit conference in London, I share the feelings that were expressed there in a very heartfelt way by Prime Minister Fukuda. When we met at Downing Street last year, he reminded us that the Great Depression, even the war in the Pacific, might have been prevented if world leaders had met again after the breakdown of the London Economic Conference in 1930, and suggested that while we may not achieve all we hope for, we may prevent more than we realize.
Let me say, first, that we meet acutely aware that currency fluctuations, labor migrations, crop failures, and a host of other variables respect no political or geographical boundary; that every event that once was isolated affects each aspect of today's integrated, global economy. We are mutually vulnerable to and totally and equally dependent upon each other.
Together we must seek stable, noninflationary growth and jobs for our people.
Together we must seek to expand and to liberalize international trade policies and to put an end to rising protectionist sentiment.
Together we must seek a multilateral trade agreement that enhances and not obstructs world commerce.
Together we must seek to reduce energy consumption and to encourage energy exploration and production.
Together we must seek an international monetary system strong enough and flexible enough to sustain growth and to bolster confidence.
Together we must seek to share the benefits of economic progress and expanded trade with all the developing nations and channel increased aid to the world's neediest countries.
The United States and the Federal Republic are united in our commitment to these objectives. More is at stake than our economic well-being. Economic strength gives us the means and the confidence and spirit to deter war and to ensure peace.
What we do here in Bonn this week, and at home in the weeks ahead, relates directly to our military as well as our economic security.
Our defense policy is based on a strong NATO. American security is tied as closely to the security of Western Europe today as it has been for the past three decades. We are prepared to deter war in Europe and to defend all allied territory as strongly and as deeply committed as we defend the territory of the United States itself.
Tomorrow I will visit a few of the 200,000 American NATO troops stationed in Germany and the German troops who serve with them. I will assure them of this continuing commitment of the people whom I represent.
When the NATO summit met in Washington 6 weeks ago, we agreed on a Long-Term Defense Program, 15 years, that will guarantee the men the supplies and the equipment to meet any foreseeable military threat. This was not a unilateral commitment; it was a pledge made by the Alliance itself. All the Allies agreed to increase our military budget; all of us agreed to share the responsibilities of our long-term security.
The work we do together in strengthening the global economy and providing for our mutual security gives us the confidence that we seek to reduce tension with our potential adversaries.
We realize that our relationship with the Soviet Union will continue to be competitive for a long time to come and that the Soviets will continue to pose threats and challenges to Western interests. But we also recognize the threat to peace posed by a continuation of the arms race or by our inability to move beyond confrontation.
We are prepared to broaden our areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union, to seek a genuine, broadly defined, and fully reciprocal detente. We hope the Soviets will choose to join with us in making this effort. For our part we intend to make clear that we continue to seek cooperation, but we are fully prepared to protect Western interests.
Today the United States is negotiating a SALT II agreement that will preserve and enhance our own security and that of our Allies, indeed, the entire world. Reaching that agreement is essential to meeting the broad responsibilities shared by the Soviet Union and the United States to nations and to people everywhere.
We are prepared to negotiate in other areas—to seek reductions in the level of conventional forces in Europe, to limit nuclear testing, and to put a halt to further proliferation of nuclear explosives.
But genuine detente also includes restraint in the use of military power and an end to the pursuit of unilateral advantage-as in Africa today. And detente must include the honoring of solemn international agreements concerning human rights and a mutual effort to promote a climate in which these rights can flourish.
If the Soviet Union chooses to join in developing a more broad-based and reciprocal detente, the world will reap untold benefits. But whatever the Soviets decide, the West will do whatever is necessary to preserve our security while we continue, without ceasing, the search for a lasting peace. We will maintain our own strength as a clear indication of our commitment to free, democratic institutions, and our continuing obligation to our NATO Allies.
In my very short time in the Federal Republic of Germany, I have gained a deeper sense of the fundamental strength and the mutual benefit to be derived from our partnership. I believe that we will achieve the peaceful and the prosperous world we seek together.
I hope that you will join me now in a toast to world peace and to the close and enduring German-American friendship and to the health of President Scheel. To peace, and to your health, Mr. President.
Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.

state-dinners,George Bush,"October 11, 1989","
President Bush. Mr. President, welcome. Barbara and I are delighted to have this opportunity to renew our friendship and to return the hospitality that we've felt on every one of our visits to your country. And it's a great honor to host a man who has held almost every high office that Italy has to offer.
If I took the time to list every single job you've held, the dinner would be cold and out of date. [Laughter] But let me mention three: your service as a navy man, a former legislator, and President of the Senate. I've always thought that those experiences alone would be enough to prepare anyone for the Presidency. [Laughter]
And Mr. President, when I asked my advisers about the secret of your success, they told me that you have an especially interesting method to keep in touch with Italian public opinion. I wonder how many Italian ham radio operators know that the fellow who signs off as Andy Capp is really the President of Italy. And sure enough -- [laughter].
But, sir, on a serious vein, I do place great importance on the meetings that we had this morning, speaking with candor and from the heart, as friends, just the way it ought to be. And all of us here tonight know that relations between Italy and the United States have never been stronger. They really never have been.
And for millions of Americans, Italy is the old country -- home of a proud heritage, a heritage written into every page of the history of Western civilization. The greatness of Rome was known, of course, throughout the world, more than a thousand years before our country or this continent was even known to exist. And America has always been the New World, discovered by your great adventurer, Columbus -- a land of possibilities, a place where a new history could be written. And that history, our history, is one that the sons and daughters of Italy helped to write.
And so, tonight I offer this toast to old friends and also to the new Italy: a great and growing economic power, one of the world's foremost democracies, a strong and valued ally and a partner in the community of free nations.
And so, let us raise our glasses to President Francesco Cossiga, to the Republic of Italy, and to the lasting friendship and love between the people of Italy and America.
President Cossiga. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you again also on behalf of Foreign Minister De Michelis and the delegation accompanying me for the warm welcome extended to us in Washington. Mr. President, you wish to address to me very kind words to recall also the times when I was a young man and I was known as Andy Capp. [Laughter] I think that this name has helped me to overcome my handicaps. [Laughter]
Mr. President, I know fairly well that in the United States the political struggle is quite hard, but I ask you to believe me if I say that in Italy it is not easier. [Laughter]
Mr. President, your kind words through my person are addressed to my country and to the Italian people, thus confirming the deep-rooted friendship between Italy and the United States of America. Indeed, Italians and Americans share the fundamental values which inspire our common activity: the values of freedom, of peaceful development and progress, and of cooperation with all nations in full mutual respect. As your history as a nation was dawning, you placed the ideals of freedom, democracy, and social justice as the foundation stones of your Revolution. These same values which were enshrined for the first time in the American Constitution were subsequently taken up and reaffirmed in the fundamental charters of all democratic countries. And like your Revolution, the two great movements that brought about Italy's unification and national redemption, the Risorgimento and the Resistance, were based on the concept of the indissoluble and intimate relationship between the independence of the nation and the freedom of the individual.
During our conversations a few months ago in Rome at the Quirinal, what I noticed most particularly, Mr. President, was the emphasis with which you reaffirmed the continued importance of these values in view of the forceful, auspicious, but also at times perilous changes that are taking place on the international stage. Today we can safely state that those principles which underlie our political system and our joint endeavors have won through. We can rely on the knowledge that the values of freedom are not only secure but enduring, as the great Italian scholar Benedetto Croce emphasized when he wrote: ""When the question is heard whether liberty will enjoy what is known as the future, the answer must be that it has something better still; it has eternity.""
Faced with the momentous events we are witnessing -- first and foremost, the evolutionary process taking place in the Soviet Union -- those who have traditionally fought for the principles of democracy, as we have, must actively endeavor to encourage the full deployment of the potentialities now emerging. This is a common duty incumbent on the whole of the West, and its import and significance are certainly not lost on the members of the European Community. They intend to redouble their efforts to establish a climate of ever-greater mutual confidence and to restore increasingly close economic, cultural, and human relations throughout the European Continent.
Mr. President, it was also thanks to your contribution that the Atlantic summit last May confirmed the vitality of the alliance which binds us and made it possible to lay the foundations for that great improvement in East-West relations hoped for by us all. But the values and principles which our countries share should not be limited to creating common ground with regard to the great issues of relations between America and Europe and between East and West. We must work in harmony in many other fundamental fields, guaranteeing the sustained economic growth of developed countries and providing the aid which less-developed countries need in order to liberate themselves from the slavery of hunger, solving the regional conflicts that are still being waged, and overcoming the major problems afflicting mankind, regardless of national borders and irrespective of political and economic distinctions. I am referring in particular to the pollution of our planet, organized crime, terrorism, and to the dramatic scourge of the spread of drugs.
Mr. President, Italy is proud to have made its contribution of culture and personal sacrifice to the birth of a nation whose greatness and strength also stem from its diversity and its ability to absorb and assimilate contributions from the whole world into its lifeblood -- a nation whose great destiny was from the very beginning of your Revolution foreseen by Daniele Dolfin, the Ambassador of the Venetian Republic to Paris and a friend of Benjamin Franklin, when, in a dispatch sent in 1783, he wrote: ""We may well expect that with the aid of time and of European arts and knowledge, this nation will become the most formidable power in the universe.""
Mr. President, the few years that separate us from the end of the second millenium offer all of us a historic opportunity to steer the future course of mankind along the path of peace, freedom, and prosperity. I am certain that it is in this great undertaking, which we might well describe in the words of Lincoln as the triumphal march of civilization, the United States and Italy can work together to make a strong and significant contribution towards its realization.
And it is with these sentiments, Mr. President, and renewing to you and to Mrs. Bush my thanks, I would like all those present here to raise their glasses with me in a toast to the prosperity of the United States of America, to the success of the work of your administration, to your personal well-being, to that of Mrs. Bush, and to the friendship between our two peoples. To the President of the United States of America.

The President. Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Hawke -- Bob and Hazel to us, to all of you -- we are just delighted to have this opportunity to welcome you back to Washington, sir. I would once more reminisce about the fondness with which I remember our visit to Australia a few years ago, and then, of course, your own previous visits to Washington, DC, as Prime Minister. And now we have been delighted with your gracious company during this all-too-brief stay.
And lest you wonder about the Prime Minister's travel plans, it is my understanding that he and Hazel go right to the airport, climb onto an airplane, and will be seen smiling and greeting the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany about 1 p.m. Federal Republic of Germany time. So, we will be brief, and -- [laughter]. But I think the friendship that we feel towards our distinguished visitor is but a reflection of a deeper closeness.
Wilbur Garrett, the editor of the National Geographic, wrote that, ""Both America and Australia exert an enduring fascination on each other, like brothers growing up in different parts of the world."" Well, we've borne great sacrifices as brothers in war, and now we share great responsibilities as brothers in peace. And in this century, Australia has risen in stature from a dominion of England to become a nation, a great nation, in culture and in the arts. The world has taken

The President. Nancy and I are delighted to again host an evening that brings Americans and Canadians together. No gathering could be more enjoyable and nothing is less unusual. Canadians and Americans congregate the world over on the least provocation. An inviting border has made us close and easygoing neighbors.
The essence and the strength of the relations between our two countries are people. Our people naturally get along well together. We share our triumphs and victories as we share our adversities. And when at times we spar, we do so without rancor, and we work out our differences. May this very special and productive spirit of cooperation remain in place. As John Diefenbaker so ably put it, ""Our peoples are North Americans; we are the products of the same hope, faith, and dreams.""
Well, your visit comes as we're on the threshold of a major event, important and historic to you and me and the nations we lead. I speak of our recently signed free trade agreement. Years ago British Admiral Beatty voiced the sense of our trade agreement when he explained what defends our common border: ""nothing but the sound common sense and sound good will of two practical nations."" Well, our new agreement makes much common sense and sets the stage for much good will. We shall avoid the perils of protectionism and gain the advantages of each country producing what each is best able to bring to market. Generations of Canadians and Americans will know you as the farsighted leader who proposed the free trade agreement. It will prove to be as big and as important as the magnitude of our bilateral trade. It signals to our trading partners that we are sincere in our belief that lowering tariffs and trade barriers is clearly the only answer to the distortions growing in world trade.
Your visit has allowed us to address issues other than trade. We share common concerns regarding the many aspects of the environment. Progress is being made. There is yet much we can do to make our shared continent a more comfortable and healthy place on which to live.
We've had important discussions of questions of peace and security. Canada's role is critical for the security of the Atlantic community. Canada's contribution to NATO is to be increased, which all your allies welcome. And I have seen at firsthand, Brian, the constructive contribution you've made personally in alliance deliberations like the NATO summit in March.
This is our fourth and my final summit. They started high on the ramparts of Quebec, and we've never lowered our lofty goals and objectives. I regret, however, that I could never reach those same high notes that the Prime Minister's voice so easily reached in song. [Laughter] These have been enjoyable meetings, useful meetings, and they've created bonds between us that have been seen as refreshing—as they have been hopeful to the execution of my office. In the process you've won my respect for your wise counsel and admiration for your leadership.
Mr. Prime Minister, you can look back on the years of our summits as a period in which you successfully achieved the goals you set out before you took office. You've achieved an important constitutional breakthrough. You have seen the Canadian economy grow and unemployment fall during your tenure in office. You have achieved a special place in history with our free trade agreement. Above all, you've been a strong and persistent advocate for Canada, liberally applying your adage that ""we can disagree without being disagreeable."" You have taught all of us about Canada's point of view on issues important to Canada while at the same time being a good neighbor and a firm friend. There can be little doubt that relations between the United States and Canada have prospered these last 4 years, and I thank you for both the effort and the success.
And now, excuse me just one second. To the Queen of Canada, to my good friend and good neighbor, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and Mrs. Mulroney, and to the enduring bond between our two North American peoples.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan, and chers amis [dear friends], I rise to propose a toast to the President of the United States and the First Lady. I rise also in a personal sense on behalf of Mila and myself to toast our friendship with Ronald and Nancy Reagan. For just as this is a glittering occasion of state, it is also a special one for us. This visit marks the last time we will be under this roof at a state dinner as guests of the Reagans. This is not to say, Ron, that I have no expectation of being here again— [laughter] —subject to the approval of the voters in Canada this year or next. And we'll be seeing the Reagans again at the economic summit in Toronto in June. But this is the last of our home-and-home visits, which began in Quebec City in 1985. I believe these annual meetings begun by our two administrations have now become part of the institutional framework of Canada-U.S. relations.
I suppose that too much can be made of special relationships between countries, and too much can probably be made of personal relationships between leaders. I don't think that's the case between these two countries or these two leaders. But the fact is that Canada and the United States are one another's best friends and largest trading partners. It's also a fact that Ronald Reagan and I happened to hit it off at the beginning and have got along ever since. This is not to say that either one of us has ever lost sight of the national interest of his own country, but it has helped us define the mutual interest of both our countries. And often, as we did on one or two issues today, we will disagree while continuing to search for common ground.
Those of us who hold elective office are called politicians. There's no dishonor in that. But I have seen Ronald Reagan, the statesman. I want briefly to speak to that tonight from the perspective of a friend in the eighth year of his Presidency. We're looking tonight at a period in American and world history that will in large measure, when the day is done, be known as the Reagan era. For the first time in almost 30 years an American President is completing two full terms of office.
The Reagan years have been a time of peace and prosperity. There have been moments of great difficulty and regional crisis, but the peace has been preserved. When Ronald Reagan came to this house as President, he was accused of saber rattling. In the event while strengthening Western security, he paved the way for historic arms reductions in the INF agreement and opened the door to strategic arms reductions. This is the legacy of a man of peace.
The forthcoming Moscow summit is a significant opportunity for the further reduction of East-West tensions. And the President goes with the hopes and prayers of all his allies for another successful meeting with General Secretary Gorbachev; for, as the President himself has said, a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.
When Ronald Reagan came to this house, the world was on the brink of the deepest recession in half a century. As he prepares to leave it next January, the United States and Western economies are in their 6th consecutive year of unprecedented recovery and expansion. When he leaves office, his popularity will be undiminished and his place in history secure.
I want to just say, parenthetically, something that happened to me in August of 1987. It was a Sunday, and I was reading the New York Sunday Times. And I was struck by this headline. And here's, I think, a direct quote, though I'm speaking from memory. The quote is, ""Reagan's Popularity Plummets To 59 Percent."" [Laughter] You see, right there, one sees the fundamental difference between Canada and the United States. [Laughter] It's language. [Laughter] ""Plummet"" clearly does not mean the same thing in Canada— [laughter] —as the United States. Now, what I did that day after I finished reading the Times was, I called the President up. He was at Camp David, and I said, ""Did you read the Times?"" He said, ""Yes, I did."" And he didn't sound so enthusiastic. [Laughter] I said, ""I don't know how to break this to you, but on a good day, Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl, and I together would be happy with 59 percent."" [Laughter] Look, I'll settle for 39 percent. [Laughter]
Every leader of a democracy knows the turbulence and the challenges that free societies exemplify. Every leader worth his salt knows the joys of high accomplishment and the sadness of hopes unfulfilled. But history is usually generous to those who show leadership, who brought prosperity, who strengthened freedom, and who kept the global peace. Ronald Reagan has done these things, while never losing his engaging manner and his warm, good humor.
When you look around this house, you get a sense not only of history but of serenity and continuity and of how much Nancy Reagan has contributed to that. She has brought her own brand of commitment and elegance to the White House. She has brought as well her own sense of public purpose to addressing the tragedy of drug abuse not only in your country but throughout the Western Hemisphere. As a Prime Minister and a head of government, I know something of the pressures and tensions on relationships and families that come with these jobs. And of all the world capitals, nowhere is the curiosity greater and the pressure higher than here in Washington. In this unique and demanding climate, Nancy Reagan has been more than a model of grace; she has demonstrated exemplary qualities of loyalty and resolve, which I believe are to her great credit.
On an occasion such as this, one speaks briefly of the achievements, the agenda between our countries, and I'll be very brief. The agenda is comprehensive, the issues are complex, and the solutions are, as President Kennedy once said in regard to Canada-U.S. relations, ""neither easy nor automatic."" As for the achievements, there is still work for you, Mr. President, to get the free trade agreement ratified by Congress. This is a tremendous accomplishment—the largest trade agreement ever negotiated between two sovereign countries—and it opens up a world of new possibilities and prosperity for both our peoples on both sides of the border. And one of the reasons we made that agreement is that President Reagan believed in the initiative from the beginning and stayed with it to the end.
Engraved on the mantlepiece of this room, there is a quotation, I believe, from the first occupant of this house. I quote it because it applies to the present occupant of this house: ""May none but honest and wise men,"" President John Adams wrote, ""ever rule under this roof."" Ronald Reagan has been both honest and wise, and for us and for Canada he has been a good and a valued friend.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise as I propose a toast to the President of the United States and Mrs. Reagan: To the President and Mrs. Reagan.
"
state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"November 15, 1999","
President and Mrs. Demirel, Prime Minister and Mrs. Ecevit, to the government coalition partners, the other parliamentary leaders, Mr. Speaker, distinguished Turkish and American friends.
Let me begin by thanking you, Mr. President, for the wonderful reception. I am delighted to see so many friends of our two countries at a moment of great optimism for our relationship, tempered by great sadness over the tragedy of the earthquakes you have suffered.
President Eisenhower visited Turkey for a day in 1959. President Bush came for 2 days in 1991. I am proud to be spending 5 days here. Every visit seems to be twice as long as the last one. [Laughter] The good news is, our partnership is becoming more important every year. The bad news is that if American Presidents keep this up, some day one of us will not be welcome here. [Laughter]
Our relations go back to the beginning of the United States. Not long after our country was created, a high official, the Grand Senor, at what was then Constantinople, saw a ship flying the American flag sail into the harbor. Because the flag with stars on it was considered to be a lucky sign, he predicted then that the people of Turkey and the United States would enjoy a long friendship. Now, his prophecy has come to pass.
Our friendship deepened more than 50 years ago, when another ship sailed into the Bosphorus. I'm told that every citizen of your country then alive remembers the day the United States ship Missouri arrived to protect the peace in the uncertain days following World War II. That sent a message that America will always be there when our Turkish friends need us.
Since then, it's been equally true that each time our common interests have been imperiled, the Turkish people have been there alongside America. This fall another American vessel came to Turkey, under tragic circumstances, when the Kearsarge arrived to assist the victims of the earthquake. Now Turkey again has suffered natural disaster. And again I send the same simple message: Please, let us know what we can do to help, and we will be there.
How we use our friendship will do much to define the century we are about to begin. What we do together will help to determine whether peace takes hold in the Middle East, whether tolerance takes root in the Balkans, whether young democracies succeed in the Caucasus. The way we do business together will help to determine whether our people have the jobs and reliable sources of energy necessary well into the new century. What we have stood for together, most recently in Kosovo, will help to decide whether the coming century is marked by democracy rooted in our common humanity or by tyranny feeding off hatred.
I must take a moment tonight to express my appreciation for the contributions to the United States of our citizens of Turkish descent. Just last week a remarkable Turkish-American, named Kenan Sahin, gave $100 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology out of gratitude for the education he received there. Ahmet Ertegun was the son of a Turkish Ambassador to the United States who grew up in Washington. But instead of attending diplomatic events like this one, he spent most of his time going out to hear rhythm and blues musicians. When he founded Atlantic Records, he fundamentally changed the history of modern American music in ways that have greatly enriched every single citizen of our country and hundreds of millions of people throughout the world.
When we finished shaking hands with all of you tonight, the President said, ""Well, I know that was a long line, but I wanted you to see the face of modern Turkey."" Well, I have had the opportunity to see the face of modern Turkey, and I am confident that when it comes to our relationship and our common endeavors, the best is yet to come.
Mr. President, we are grateful for your leadership and all you have done in your distinguished career. Fifty years ago you came to the United States to study and work among us. When we celebrated our Bicentennial in 1976, you wrote a moving essay describing how your first visit persuaded you of the importance of, and I use your words, ""providing full opportunities to all citizens, regardless of birth, origin, and creed.""
Mr. President, though your engineering days are over, I am proud of the bridges you have helped us to build together. I ask all of you to join Hillary, me, and our American delegation in a toast to the President and Mrs. Demirel, Prime Minister and Mrs. Ecevit, and the people of Turkey.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"June 07, 1983","
President Reagan. President and Mrs. Houphouet-Boigny, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, it's a special pleasure for me to welcome our guest of honor this evening.
During the 1980 campaign I suggested that the United States should return to some of the basics of free enterprise—policies that would encourage individual responsibility, hard work, and investment. It's taken time, but we're at last overcoming the economic uncertainty that we inherited. I'll have to admit I've always been confident that we would. I just kept telling myself, ""It worked in Ivory Coast, didn't it?"" [Laughter]
Seriously, though, Mr. President, your many successes haven't gone unnoticed here in the United States. Unlike many other countries, some of which are far richer in natural resources, you Chose the high road of political and economic freedom. In doing so, you've made Ivory Coast a shining example to the rest of Africa and the world.
Mr. President, your wisdom has been a guiding light for your people and a beacon of reason and modernization in the world arena. You are a leader who stresses dialog as a means of solving even the most vexing problems. You advocate compromise over confrontation, conciliation over conflict. Your humane and democratic values reflect well on the people of Ivory Coast.
During our discussions today we touched on many mutual areas of concern, especially those dealing with the promotion of economic growth. The President had been forced to make tough decisions concerning government spending. Well, I can identify with that. [Laughter] And I deeply admire his farsighted commitment to the long-range interests of his people. Today we're confident that closeness and interaction between our two peoples can be nothing but a blessing for us all.
So, I ask you now to join me in a toast to President Houphouet-Boigny and to the continued friendship between our two peoples that his visit attests to.
President Houphouet. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, allow me first of all to thank you for your warm welcome and for all the thoughtfulness that has been shown us since our arrival here. I should also like to express to you our sincere gratitude for your kind words describing Ivory Coast policies and for having affirmed so clearly your desire to develop our cooperation.
One of your predecessors remarked that history has given the United States the role of being either a witness to the failure of freedom or the architect of its triumph. I can only subscribe to that fine thought. Yet the extent of your commitments, the immense responsibility they imply, even for the most powerful nation in the world, might have led me to fear that in a time of crisis, when, especially in your own hemisphere as well as in Asia and the Middle East, problems as worrisome as they are sensitive require all or your vigilance and that of the team around you. I might have feared that your attention might have been diverted from the seemingly less pressing problems of Africa. It was therefore most reassuring for me to note your determination to help Africa to regain its peace and to achieve a prosperity that seems discouragingly ever more remote.
You, Mr. President, said on February 13, 1980, that the United States has an obligation to its citizens and to the people of the world never to let those who would destroy freedom dictate the future course of human existence on our planet. There is no lack of opportunity for the enemies of freedom who find, in poverty and ignorance, the best fuel for their sinister designs. It is, therefore, important not to neglect any political, social, economic, educational, or cultural sector—any country, and region, any society where there may develop and explode the kind of conflicts that the enemies of freedom provoke or sustain. And since prevention is better than cure, one must also be certain not to allow the perpetuation of unjust situations that foster them.
To be sure, you, Mr. President, have consistently stressed the need for individuals, like nations, to take their problems into their own hands, to assume responsibility for their own future, and to cease to rely solely on assistance, as some at times are all too pleased to do.
In Ivory Coast we have always urged our fellow citizens to rely first and foremost on themselves. But no one can deny that there are individuals and there are nations that are handicapped and cannot emerge from their tragic situation without aid—extended aid. Nor can anyone deny that the world today finds itself in the absurd situation of wasting money on ever more costly weapons-sums of money which, compared to which the amounts of money that go for development assistance, are pitifully small.
And the situation is aggravated by the constant threat of insecurity, which compels the developing nations that have modest, indeed, even inadequate resources to fight simultaneously on two fronts: the development front and the security front, with development too often having to be sacrificed for the sake of security. So, what the developing countries and Africa, in particular, need most is peace and stability, the precondition for any harmonious development.
You, the American people, are the best equipped to recognize the lack of progress of countries that do not enjoy political stability and which are becoming increasingly serious threats to world peace. The best factor for peace is the well-being, the happiness of peoples. Peace and well-being are inseparable.
The West has the means to lend effective assistance to Africa, but that aid will be for naught if our own production efforts are constantly ruined by speculators. To be sure, Africa at present only accounts for 2 percent of world trade. That is not a great deal; we recognize that. But that is the Africa of today. It is not the Africa of tomorrow, the Africa of the future, the Africa we want to build with the West, drawing on our own efforts. Our potential is great.
I should like to quote here that masterpiece of Alexis de Tocqueville, ""Democracy in America."" In his conclusion he wrote, ""I am filled with fears and filled with hopes. I see great evils that can be avoided or contained, and I am becoming ever more firm in my conviction that in order to be honest and prosperous, the democratic nations have only to determine that they will be so.""
I could not conclude more fittingly, Mr. President, than by expressing our confidence in the democratic nations, among which the United States holds the most important place.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to please join with me in a toast to President Ronald Reagan and to Mrs. Reagan to whom I present my most respectful and heartfelt compliments, and also to the happiness and to the prosperity of the great people of the United States and to the friendship between the United States and the Ivory Coast.
Thank you.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"September 28, 1979","
PRESIDENT CARTER. President Lopez Portillo, we welcome you and your lovely wife, Carmen, and your personal family and your official family back to the White House. Tonight we're determined to make the result of our toasts better than they were when I was in Mexico City. [Laughter]
You represent a great democratic nation, growing in world influence. And, Mr. President, your depth of insight and your breadth of vision match the past and the future achievements of your great country.
Your speech yesterday at the United Nations on the future of the world as it relates to energy was indeed one of the most profound and the most beautiful speeches I have ever read. This can lay the groundwork for discussions among all nations on Earth—as you said, democratic nations and socialist nations, developed nations and undeveloped nations which can lead to the resolution of one of the most difficult challenges of our time. This is typical of your personal leadership, Mr. President, and the leadership of your great country.
It's an honor and a privilege and an exciting experience for us to have you again in our country for serious discussions that will affect your people and mine.
Our nations are linked by both border and by destiny, by blood kinship and by a love of freedom. Both of us have thrown off colonial rule. Our ancestors know what it means to go from oppression to liberty. The relationships between our two countries have not always been happy, nor always peaceful. Some differences in the past, unfortunately, have even been settled by bloodshed. Some differences even in our own lifetime have been too long ignored or hidden. Now I believe that these troubled and uncertain times between our two countries are gone forever. If we lead well, we can write a new and a long history of peace, friendship, cooperation, and understanding between our people.
We are determined that our dialog will always be creative, that our negotiations will be frank and fair and mature and productive, that we will solve problems so that our people will have a better quality of life, and that together, through leadership, we can benefit the people of other nations.
When I had the honor to speak to the members of the Mexican Congress, I quoted the words of your great leader, Benito Juarez, that are inscribed on the walls of the Chamber of Deputies. The people of your country—through television, thanks to you—heard these words, but I would like the citizens of my country to hear them tonight here in the White House. Entre los individuos, como entre las naciones, el respeto aI derecho humano es la paz.
INTERPRETER. Between individuals, as between nations, respect for the rights of others is peace.
PRESIDENT CARTER. Very good. [Laughter] I might say that that is a perfect translation. [Laughter]
And in that spirit, ladies and gentlemen, that between nations and between individuals there can be a perfect peace, I would like to offer a toast—without wine, but with water, and we'll drink wine later on—to the President of Mexico, to the family which he has brought here, both official and personal, to peace between our two countries, to better understanding throughout the world, and to the people of Mexico.
[At this point, there was a brief pause as wine was served.]
If I could have your attention again, just to make sure that the toast is authenticated— [laughter] —I would like to again offer a toast to the President of a great country and to the people of Mexico. Welcome to our Nation.
PRESIDENT LOPEZ PORTLLO. Mr. President of the United States and Mrs. Carter:
For me, for my family and the members of my party, it is a great honor to meet again for the third time.
Our two peoples feel great security in the fact that since we are neighbors, the two Presidents of the two countries can meet as frequently as we do. To communicate is actually to open up the possibility of a peaceful coexistence, to live together. Communication is a guarantee of human coexistence.
For me, it is a great satisfaction to communicate with the President of the United States for the third time, to be able to once again witness the enormous values that he holds in himself as a human being- his generosity and his braveness. For me, President Carter, it is a great pleasure to see you again and a great honor to take up, once again, the very serious matters in the very open way in which we have dealt with them.
Today we could see that we were not mistaken when we decided upon a certain way of work between the two countries. It was a new system that had some problems in taking off, but which is now working very well. We were right, President Carter, and I am very happy that we were. We can now analyze in depth the bilateral problems that, perforce, have to come about when two countries are neighbors.
Life is risk: life is a solution of problems. As we say in my homeland, it is only the dead that do not make noise. [Laughter] Noise is life, and our two countries are very vital countries. They are both located in the same continent, but they have two different roots.
We are learning to live together. It is a great guarantee for us that we have this possibility of living together at a time when the head of the Government of this great country is a person like Mr. Carter. He has been very generous, as he always is, when he referred to the proposal that we made yesterday in my address before the General Assembly of the United Nations. In this proposal, we stand on opposite sides.
The United States is the powerful nation, perhaps the most outstanding expression of this kind of a nation in the world. Mexico is a developing nation. There is a border between us 3,000 kilometers long, and perhaps this is the best expression of the north-south relationship.
If we can understand the facts of our reality as a problem, if we can state our facts as a problem within this climate of mutual respect, which has prevailed today and which has prevailed always when we have met, we can then prove that we can win out, and we can transcend the differences between the north and the south, between developing and the developed. That is why I have high hopes that at the only universal forum that we men have been able to create, and which we sometimes tend to ignore as if it had just fallen upon us from Mars—since the real fact is that we created that forum ourselves and it will be whatever we want it to be, at that forum, no doubt, we can bring up problems that are of interest to all.
I am obsessed with the problem that I consider to be fundamental for the future of humanity, the problem of energy. We have this energy supply in Mexico. We have hydrocarbons, but we know that it is a depletable resource. I would like to transmit to you the need to create an awareness in all of mankind, so that they will understand that the generation that is represented here tonight is the generation that will see the end of the era of oil and will witness the beginning of a new era or the end of them all. With this thought in mind, we have come to the United Nations, and now we have come to the United States to present our reflections to Mr. Carter, in order to be able to win the political will of the United States.
We have many times said that to be strong means great responsibilities towards humanity. I am fully convinced that if the United States expresses its political will to put order into the world of energy sources, but within a framework of responsibility that will comprise all of humanity and not through bilateral agreements, bloc agreements, or unilateral struggles, in order to become independent—I am convinced that we can survive, that we can go ahead, that we can cross a bridge that connects one era with another.
However, sometimes I reflect, and I think that what is reasonable and simple is not always what is possible. Many times, unfortunately, humanity seeks absurd solutions. Perhaps it is because what is absurd does not require great discipline. But I feel that humanity can become disciplined, and it can go from one style of energy into another lifestyle which requires another energy source. And I insist, once again, if the United States expresses its political will in this direction, this will be made possible.
The objective is a very simple one. The proposition is a very simple one. Let us prepare to go from one era into another era by putting order into a resource, into the exploration, exploitation, distribution, and consumption of the resource we have now, and let us prepare to use another one later on, because if we do not, life will no longer be possible.
Mexico is willing to do whatever it can do. Before all the nations of the world, it has expressed its political will to take on a commitment. We consider that it is indispensable to commit ourselves. We must think about our children and our children's children and the world we're going to leave behind for them to live in. Will it be an orderly, peaceful world, or will it be the world of the apocalypse? Will it be a disorderly world? I believe that it is not a difficult selection. I forgive for insisting upon this idea once and again, I beg your forgiveness.
It is with this idea in mind that we have come to the United States in order to have the satisfaction to review, within the framework of that very intelligent instrument that was established by President Carter and myself, the state of our relationship, to seek your solidarity, to solve a problem that is everyone's problem, and to recommend what I would consider to be a very simple remedy.
During my political campaign, I insistently said that the solution is to be found in all of us. I believe, in the case of energy sources and ever so many other matters that are very serious for mankind, we must constantly think that the solution is to be found in all of us. To these values that are common to all of our democracies, the friendship of our peoples, with the hope that our communication lines will be always open between us, and to the happiness of the United States and, particularly, the Carter family, I ask you to join me in a toast.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"March 19, 1985","
President Reagan. President Alfonsin and distinguished guests and ladies and gentlemen, it's a great pleasure for me to welcome you to the White House. And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting with President Alfonsin today.
Our discussions were cordial and productive, and of course today was not the first meeting that we've had. Last September we met just before attending the United Nations General Assembly. That was in the midst of our Presidential campaign last September, and I remember that you remarked that although being President is a hard job, sometimes getting there is even harder. [Laughter]
President Alfonsin and I have much in common. We both have gone through many campaigns and asked for votes from many different kinds of people. Down in Texas during the 1976 primary, they had me out knocking on doors. And I remember one kind of rural area—I'd been Governor of California, but I wasn't all that well known in Texas—and I knocked on the door, and an old fellow in his undershirt and jeans came to the door. And I told him I was running for President. And having been in the occupation I'd been in for a number of years, I was kind of surprised when he asked me what I'd done for a living. [Laughter] And I told him I'd been an actor. And then he asked me what my name was. And I thought, well, maybe if I give him a hint. So I said, ""Well, my initials were RR."" And with that his face lit up, and he turned, and he ran back into the house, and he was yelling, ""Ma, Ma, come on out here quick—Roy Rogers is outside."" [Laughter]
But, seriously though, as I mentioned at our ceremony this morning, the people of our two countries have so much in common, not the least of which is the spirit of the frontier exemplified by the gaucho and the cowboy. More significant, however, is the bond of democracy, the love of freedom that's found in the hearts of our people. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate President Alfonsin, who is, on behalf of the Argentine people, accepting the international democracy prize from the Center for Democracy. And I can think of no finer example to others than Argentina's inspiring return to democracy. Congratulations, Mr. President.
This generation of Argentinians is laying the foundation for what will be enjoyed by your fellow countrymen hundreds of years hence. And this is in keeping with the tradition of San Martin, an heroic individual significant not only in your history but in that of the entire hemisphere. I think it's interesting to note that once San Martin was successful in freeing half a continent, he assumed the title of protector.
And that, perhaps, captures the essence of our responsibility. Those of us who enjoy the freedom and independence passed to us by brave and noble individuals like San Martin, Washington, and others, especially those of us in elected office, must be the protectors of liberty. This is our trust, our obligation. San Martin once said: ""You will be what you must be. If not, you are nothing.""
President Alfonsin, you've already demonstrated to your countrymen and to all the world that you're willing to live up to the enormous trust that you hold in your hands. I look forward to working closely with you in the years ahead. I salute you. And I ask all of you to join me in a toast to President Alfonsin, Mrs. Alfonsin, and the free people of Argentina.
President Alfonsin. Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, we have ended a day of intense, frank, cordial, and mutually enriching consultations. The success of this day, characterized from the beginning by exceptional American hospitality, is due in great part to your warmth, Mrs. Reagan, as well as to the informal and friendly atmosphere that you, Mr. President, imparted to our meetings. My wife and my friends are sincerely grateful for this hospitality, and I sincerely thank both of you.
In discussing the different aspects of international affairs, we have discovered that on many points our views converge. And if we also discovered a few differences in our analysis, it should neither surprise us nor alarm us. As I imagine it, the relationship between Washington and Buenos Aires presupposes—and I said that when I arrived-that we assume the defense of our respective national interests from a perspective of cooperation, foresight, and mutual sincerity.
It seems to me that within this framework we should explore with a certain amount of audacity, imagination, and good will the profiles of a realistic and enduring relationship between Latin America and the United States.
Mr. President, in your Inaugural Address—I mean your last Inaugural Address—I was moved by a suggestive evocation you made of the revolutionary past of the United States, and I quote you: ""For the first time in history they said government is not our master, but rather our servant, and the only power of government—the government will be that which we, the people, allow it to have.""
How can we not link these words to the basic grounds that explain what the forces of democracy have achieved in Argentina to reestablish the sovereignty of our people. Why should two peoples whose convictions are nourished by such principles not be able to understand one another in fundamental matters?
And I am also aware of the fact that you and I share an intense concern about peace in the world. Of course, no doubt, our responsibilities are different. But in our area, we've made, I think, a great contribution to peace, because in the southern cone we've settled peacefully a century-old dispute with Chile.
Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, as I toast for your personal well-being and that of all of you here tonight, I do so having specially in mind the American people. To your people we also offer this deeply felt tribute: They are a people who are the architects of the civilization where material achievements have always been united to a great spiritual force. Thank you very much.

state-dinners,George Bush,"April 19, 1989","
The President. You are among friends, sir, your lovely Queen, and among admirers. And your visit here gives me and Barbara a chance, in a very small way, to tell you how much we appreciated your special hospitality to us when we visited you at your lovely home at Aqaba, as well as your beautiful home in Amman itself, not so many months ago.
This magnificent picture of Abraham Lincoln that I know you're all admiring was painted by George Healy in 1869. Upstairs in my office -- excuse me, a little slight cold -- upstairs in my office there's another marvelous picture of Abraham Lincoln, and that was also painted by George Healy 4 years earlier. And I took His Majesty to see it today. It's called ""The Peacemakers,"" and the picture shows Lincoln in exactly the same pensive pose as this magnificent picture. But in the picture upstairs, there's a window right over his left shoulder, and out that window one can see this beautiful rainbow. And the picture depicts Lincoln with his generals -- three generals -- right near the end of the war that threatened our Union and pitted brother against brother. The rainbow in the picture by Healy symbolized the hope of peace, the imminent end to hostilities that near bled us as a nation to death. And so, Your Majesty, it is my fervent hope that by working together we can guarantee that there will be a rainbow over the Middle East. And war must give way to peace. And whether it's the turmoil or the fighting in the West Bank that plagues us all or the heart-rending hostilities that we now all feel so strongly about in a fractured Lebanon, we must all recommit ourselves to lasting peace in the Middle East.
And this visit today by the King of Jordan comes at a crucial moment in your region's history that -- we feel it, we in the United States feel it. And I think the King summed it up well when he told me today that the time is right. But let me assure you, sir, that we can sense an urgency to the quest for peace now. Our task is to use that urgency to seize the moment. And toward that end, Your Majesty, I look forward to working with you as old friends. And I mean that; it's not a diplomatic use of the word. Let us find new ways to bridge the deep differences that exist. Let's reduce suspicions and prepare the way for negotiations that will lead to the comprehensive settlement that everybody wants. And I pledge to work with you, sir, first to bring the rainbow of hope to the wonderful people of Jordan, and to all your neighbors, and then, with that rainbow clearly in view, to finalize a peace so secure that not a single child will know the horrors of battle.
And so, my friends, I ask you to join me in a toast to the goal of peace and to raise your glasses to the health of His Majesty King Hussein and to Queen Noor, of whom America is so especially proud, and to the lasting friendship between Jordan and the United States of America.
The King. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, distinguished guests, and dear friends. I thank you, Mr. President. I am deeply moved by the generosity of your remarks and the affection and hospitality with which you and Mrs. Bush received Noor, myself, and my colleagues. We are most appreciative. It is clear that the kinder, gentler America of which you have spoken begins in this house. I was also genuinely gratified, Mr. President, by the assurances you gave this morning of your commitment to the security and well-being of Jordan. We, indeed, feel very much at home, which befits friends.
The friendship between Jordan and the United States has indeed been special. It began 30 years ago when I first came to the White House to meet President Eisenhower. I have since dined in this lovely room as the guest of Presidents on more occasions than I can count. If that is a record, it is one of which I am proud. These have all been memorable occasions, but none more so than tonight as your guest, Mr. President, and the guest of Mrs. Bush.
But our friendship is not only personal, which I treasure, it is based as well on the common values which our two nations share: freedom, equality, and human dignity. Friendship deserves the most serious consideration of those who enjoy it. When there is joy, one calls upon friends to celebrate. When there is sorrow, friends come to comfort one. When there is a task to be done, friends join together in common effort. There is honor and pride and true friendship, as is evident here tonight.
One of the sorrows which we share is the continuous tragedy of that of the Arab-Israeli conflict. To end this tragedy is the focus of our visit. I was interested in your explanation this morning, Mr. President, of the American viewpoint regarding steps to further the cause of peace in our area. And as I assured you this morning, Jordan will cooperate closely with the United States to achieve a just, durable, and comprehensive peaceful settlement. We will support you in all your endeavors to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in the Middle East. And God willing, we will see that rainbow, and so will people in our part of the world. And God willing, it will be our contribution for a better future for generations to come on all sides in that area of the world.
Mr. President, we share with you an unusual fact: the names of our founding capitals. Philadelphia was the birthplace of your independence. Philadelphia was, as well, the ancient name of our capital, Amman. The meaning of both is the same: brotherly love. In this spirit, I would like to convey the best wishes and warmest greetings from the people of Jordan to you, Mr. President, and Mrs. Bush, and to all of your fellow Americans.
Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, may I ask you to join me in a toast to the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"April 24, 2014","
Good evening. Konbanwa. Your Majesties, I thank you for the extraordinary welcome that you have given to me and my delegation today, and I thank you for your gracious hospitality tonight.
Prime Minister Abe and Mrs. Abe, distinguished guests and friends, It has been nearly 50 years since my mother first brought me to Japan, but I have never forgotten the kindness that the Japanese people showed me as a 6-year-old boy far away from home. I remain grateful for the welcome that Your Majesties gave me when I returned here as President, on the 20th anniversary of your ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
And I am deeply honored to be with you as a guest of state tonight, which is a reflection of the great friendship between our two peoples.
It's also very humbling. I stand here as the 44th President of the United States. Your Majesty is the 125th Emperor of Japan. [Laughter]And your family has embodied the spirit of the Japanese people across more than two millennia. And we feel that spirit here tonight in His Majesty's commitment to achieving peace and the resilience of the Japanese people who, despite difficult decades, despite the tragedies of 3 years ago, continue to inspire the world with your strength and discipline and dignity—your hinkaku.
And I saw that spirit today. In the glory of the Meiji Shrine, I experienced the beauty of a religious ceremony rooted in Japan's ancient past. In my work with Prime Minister Abe, we have strengthened our alliance for today, an alliance that will never be broken. And in the eager students that I met and the remarkable technologies that I saw, I glimpsed the future our nations can forge together.
Through all of this, although we are separated by vast oceans, our peoples come together every day in every realm. We create and build together, sparking new innovations for a changing world. We study and research together, unlocking new discoveries to cure disease and save lives. We go to the far corners of the Earth together, to keep the peace and feed the hungry. And we go to space together to understand the mysteries of the universe. We stand together in moments of joy, as when Japanese baseball players help propel America's teams to victory. And we stand together in moments of difficulty and pain, as we did 3 years ago.
Your Majesty, we will never forget how, in those trying days, you spoke from this palace directly to the people of this nation. And I would like to conclude by recalling the spirit of your message then, because it also remains our wish tonight, for the friendship and alliance between our two peoples.
May we never give up hope, may we always take care of each other, and may we continue to live strong for tomorrow.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"April 28, 2015","
President Obama. Well, Michelle and I are honored to welcome you to the White House as we host our friends, Prime Minister and Mrs. Abe, and as we celebrate the enduring alliance and great friendship between the United States and Japan.
I want to begin by paying tribute to two leaders in their own right, and I know Shinzo agrees: two women who are passionate about the causes they believe in, who speak their minds, who are better dancers than us—[laughter]—and an inspiration to so many women and girls, including the students they met today. And I have to say, the First Lady is more responsible for the beautiful room tonight than I am. So thank you, Michelle and Akie.
On my last visit to Tokyo, the Prime Minister and I went to what is reputed to be the best sushi place in Tokyo. [Laughter] And I have to confess that you could not have the sushi if you did not have some excellent sake to go with it. [Laughter] Michelle just revealed that today, on her recent visit to Tokyo, she and Mrs. Abe also indulged in sake. So tonight we're breaking with tradition a little bit and serving sake from Shinzo's home Prefecture of Yamaguchi. And please enjoy yourselves, but not too much. [Laughter]
It's appropriate that we have a Japanese theme to our dinner this evening. This morning I mentioned the Japanese Americans who were such important friends and parts of my community in my youth in Hawaii. And tonight I'm thinking about one of them in particular, a man who called himself Freddy, who ran a small market near our house. And he became great friend of my grandfather's. And part of the reason he was such a great friend is because he saved us the best cuts of tuna and toro for sashimi, and then, he'd also slip in some rice candy with edible wrappers, which was fascinating to me as a child. [Laughter] And they were small gestures, but they always remained with me as an example of how Japanese culture was woven into my upbringing and spoke to the ties of friendship and family that bring us here together tonight.
In 1957, Shinzo's grandfather, Prime Minister Kishi, addressed our Senate and our House of Representatives. He said that he hoped his visit would lead to ""a strong and enduring partnership that will open the door to a new era of Japanese-American relations."" Tomorrow his grandson will continue to carry our partnership forward when he makes history as the first Japanese Prime Minister to address a joint meeting of Congress.
So in honor of this historic occasion, I want to welcome all of you outstanding leaders from our two countries. You represent the friendship and the bonds that we carry forward into this new century. And in celebration of the progress that we've achieved today, I'm going to attempt a haiku. [Laughter] Here goes:
Spring, green, and friendship
United States and Japan
Nagoyaka ni!
——which means ""harmonious feeling."" That's certainly how I feel. I am sure that I'm the first President ever to recite a haiku. [Laughter] Basho has nothing to worry about. With that, let me propose a toast, with some sake. Be careful, people. [Laughter] To our guests, Prime Minister Abe and Mrs. Abe, to the friendship between our two peoples, and to our magnificent alliance. It does so much not just for our two countries, but for peace and prosperity in the world. May it endure for all seasons and all time. Cheers! Kanpai!
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
Let me present to you the Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe.
Prime Minister Abe. Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking you for arranging this wonderful dinner tonight. During my visit to Washington, DC, last time, I declared the revival of the alliance between Japan and the United States. Two years have passed since then, and Japan is now regaining its resilience and will continue our path together with the United States.
Today Barack and I had an excellent summit meeting in the morning. On the occasion, both of us reaffirmed how robust the alliance is and issued a joint vision statement taking into account the path of the alliance for the past 70 years, since the end of World War II. This was an extremely meaningful achievement. By working hand in hand with President Obama, we, the two nations, will continuously make proactive contribution to global peace and prosperity.
Tomorrow I will address a joint session of U.S. Congress for the first time as Japanese Prime Minister. Taking that opportunity, I would like to send out a strong message that both Japan and the United States, which once fought with each other, now achieved reconciliation; and that we will make contribution to addressing challenges that mankind faces.
I have to confess that the day before yesterday, and yesterday, I was seriously practicing the speech that I'm going to give at the joint session tomorrow. But my wife unfortunately told me that she is getting tired of listening to the speech. [Laughter] So last night we ended up in a separate room. [Laughter]
Ladies and gentlemen, the current Japan-U.S. alliance shows extremely close ties, forming a foundation for our economic growth and economic prosperity. For instance, Japan's Kawasaki Rail Car built new metro rail parts in Nebraska, which run through Washington, DC. Boeing 787 is flying everywhere in the world. And guess what, more than a third of its parts were made in Japan. Barack, you are an enthusiastic fan of sushi. And last, but not least, I have to confess something about myself too. I am one of the hardcore fans of the American TV drama, ""House of Cards."" [Laughter] But I would like to draw your attention to my commitment that I am not going to show this ""House of Cards"" to my fellow minister, Deputy Prime Minister. [Laughter] In any case, you won't find another bilateral relationship like ours.
Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, when the United States stands up to fight against various challenges of the world, and when Barack stands at the forefront to tackle with the variety of global challenges, you will not be alone. Next to you, there is always Japan. Japan has been and will be always standing side by side with the United States in addressing global challenges, such as the outbreak of the Ebola disease and climate change.
The partnership between Japan and the United States is simply unparalleled in building the future of Asia and the world. I know everyone here knows that famous song by Diana Ross, ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough."" The songs goes, ""Ain't no mountain high enough; ain't no valley low enough to keep me from you."" [Laughter] The relationship of Japan and the United States is just like this. [Laughter]
So with that, I'd like to propose a toast, and also I'd like to acknowledge First Lady, Mrs. Obama, for choosing the sake from Yamaguchi, where I am from.
Last year, when Barack visited Japan, we went to a very, very popular sushi restaurant. And because of the facts that the two leaders enjoyed—ordered sushi, now they become more and more popular in Japan. But there was slight—one problem that involved in this arrangement of sushi dinner together with Barack. I actually prepared one brand of sake from Hiroshima, not my district. This was actually arranged by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. And probably because of the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister Kishida is from Hiroshima, he intentionally chose a brand from Hiroshima instead of Yamaguchi. And because of that selection, I got so much pressure and criticism from the local people in Yamaguchi that I actually could share this wonderful story with Mrs. Obama when she visited Japan. So probably because of that selection before last year, maybe Mrs. Obama intentionally chose the brand of Yamaguchi just for this occasion.
So with that, I'd like to note the kind conservation of First Lady, Mrs. Obama, and also I'd like to acknowledge the help that I always receive from my wife Akie. And I'd like to propose a toast for good health and prosperity, as well as the further development of the Japan-U.S. relationship tonight. Kanpai!
President Obama. Kanpai!
[Prime Minister Abe offered a toast.]

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"October 13, 1981","
The President. Your Majesties, welcome to the White House. In the epic poem, ""El Canto de Mio Cid,"" it is pointed out that el queen buena hora nacio, el Cid was born in a favorable moment. Historically, he actually came into a world desperate for leadership. With courage that inspired a nation, el Cid, turning despair into hope and weakness into strength, won a series of battles against the foreign invaders who occupied much of Spain.
Tonight we honor a 'man who, like el Cid, was born in a favorable moment. Mankind is in desperate need of leaders with courage and wisdom. We watch the progress in Spain, the magnificent strides toward political freedom, with a sense of awe. In a world that seems to be drowning under a wave of authoritarianism, Spain shines as a beacon of hope.
This kind of progress requires of the people and of their leader a certain strength of character neither necessary nor natural in despotic regimes. Building a free society is every bit as perplexing and at times threatening as the struggle that faced el Cid. Such times as these and such challenges as those facing your country separate great leaders from lesser men, who by circumstances find themselves in positions of political power.
King Juan Carlos, Queen Sophia, and the Spanish people have risen to the task God has placed before them, and the world is being given a majestic gift—a truly free and prosperous Spain. Over the centuries, Spain has contributed so much. Whether one talks of the great Cervantes and the development of modern literature, or refers to the painting of Goya or El Greco, certainly Spain has provided Western civilization with a multitude of priceless gifts. And now, King Juan Carlos, with the courage of el Cid and the skill of the great Spanish masters, is creating a masterpiece of democracy.
In America we recognize that even with the proper leadership, a nation must have great people to maintain liberty. And in the case of Spain, we have total confidence.
So tonight, I ask you to join me in a toast to Their Majesties, to King Juan Carlos, Queen Sophia, and to the people of Spain. May they live in peace and freedom benefiting such a great people.
The King. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, I have followed the ideas expressed in your toast with keen interest and should like now, for my part, to tell you that it is a great pleasure for the Queen and for me to visit your great country once again and to listen to your warm and cordial words.
Five years ago, when I first visited your nation as King of Spain, it was my honor to tell your Congress that the restored Spanish monarchy had undertaken the commitment to be the institution under which all Spaniards would find ample scope for political participation, with no discrimination whatsoever. Today, 5 years later, I am proud to confirm that what was then a statement of intention is now a palpable and profound reality—a constitution approved by the people and by the freely elected parliament.
My country, Mr. President, a pioneer in the forging of the fundamental values of what we call the West, supported by its historic credentials and its Western and European vocation, which it will not renounce, wishes to occupy once again the place to which it is entitled in the international community. At the same time, it would like to offer as in years past its collaboration and its effort in the defense of the principles which are the very shared essence of our two nations.
On no scale of values can there be a more important goal for our two peoples than that of the defense of the principles in which the West finds its roots. Through this defense, consisting in the permanent safeguarding of the sovereignty and freedom of all the peoples of the Earth, Spain wishes to contribute to maintaining international peace and security.
We are fully aware that the peoples and nations which place moral and spiritual values above ambition for power and things material do freely express their will to live in peace with dignity. And we know that their freely elected governments heed these aspirations and join their efforts in order to attain the same goal.
Like your country, Spain defends peace and the rule of law, opposes threats and the use of force, and rejects all outside interference in its own affairs. It is in these terms that we conceive our international relations, which we wish to maintain peacefully with all peoples.
Our friendship with the American nation is as old as its origins. Yesterday, the day of our arrival in your country, was the 489th anniversary of the arrival of the Spaniards to this continent. With that magnificent event a new era began in world history, and through that heroic exploit, which was followed up by explorers and colonizers, the lands of America, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, came to form part—and still do form a fundamental part of our Western World.
You also know, Mr. President, better than I, what the Spanish presence has meant in the American West—the tremendous work carried out by the Spanish explorers, missionaries, and colonizers in that region; the founding of dozens of towns and cities which even today form a rosary of names echoing with the sounds of Spain.
These are links, Mr. President, which nothing and nobody can break; very strong ties which transcend the vicissitudes of the moment and serve to reinforce the mutual understanding and friendship of our two peoples. This friendship now takes on a new dimension in view of our will to reinforce our progressive participation in the European and Western effort, aimed at achieving a world that is ever freer and more just and in which our sister nations may fully participate.
To the relations between Spain and the United States, that in the future they may produce abundant fruit and that the ties which unite our two countries may intensify and become ever closer, I raise my glass tonight. With my good wishes for the well-being of the great American people, and for your own personal happiness, Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan.
And I should like to express one other hope, that is that the invitation that the Queen and I have extended to you, on behalf of Spain and of the Spanish people, to visit us in Spain during your term of office at a mutually convenient time can be accepted by you. I think we can provide for you a welcome which you would like.
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"November 16, 1988","
The President. Ladies and gentlemen, Nancy and I welcome you tonight to this dinner in honor of Prime Minister Thatcher of the United Kingdom.
In 1952, when Winston Churchill had become Prime Minister for the second time and all the troubles of the cold war—including the hardships of rearming the West-were keenly felt, he was having a meeting with a group of American journalists in New York. In Martin Gilbert's extraordinary biography we find recorded these words from Churchill by his doctor, Lord Moran: ""What other nation in history, when it became supremely powerful, has had no thought of territorial aggrandizement, no ambition but to use its resources for the good of the world? I marvel at America's altruism, her sublime disinterestedness."" ""All at once I realized,"" Lord Moran went on, ""Winston was in tears. His eyes were red, his voice faltered, he was deeply moved."" Well, Prime Minister Thatcher, I think you can imagine how humbling it is for an American to read such an account. Such a tribute from Sir Winston, a man so unselfish himself in pursuit of the cause of freedom, a man who led Britain when Britain stood bravely and unselfishly alone, is only a reminder of how deeply runs the mutual admiration on both sides of the Atlantic.
When you were here 8 years ago, I first mentioned that despite all the troubles that beset us, we had every right to have hope in the future, to turn our gaze to the bright sunlit uplands of freedom. I suggested then that the totalitarian impulse had exhausted itself and that collectivism could well be at the terminal stage. Well, we've recently seen evidence that all of this may be coming about. Tonight we can hope this is so and that it will continue. We can hope that the altruism that has stood at the heart of the alliance of democratic nations in the postwar era will continue to bear fruit until the whole world is safe and free.
In this quest, those who love freedom have not had a better friend than our distinguished guest this evening. And so I hope, Prime Minister, it will not embarrass you if I take a moment now to record, for personal reasons and for the sake of history, our debt of gratitude to you.
Throughout my Presidency, Prime Minister Thatcher has shared with me the benefits of her experience and wisdom. The Prime Minister's untiring support for NATO has encouraged other allies to make the difficult decisions necessary to keep the alliance strong. Her successful fight to unshackle the British economy from government intervention and to provide greater economic freedom has been a powerful example around the world. She is a leader with vision and the courage to stay the course until the battles are won. And on occasion, she has borne the added burden of heavy criticism incurred on America's behalf.
I've been fortunate over these 8 years and for several years before that to enjoy such a close professional and personal rapport and a genuine friendship with Margaret Thatcher. Some of our predecessors were lucky enough to have had a similar partnership: Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson, Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. In each instance, both our nations have been enriched. At the same time, I believe we've added to the great stream of Anglo-American history and helped strengthen the tradition of a special relationship between the leaders of our two nations.
The impact of Mrs. Thatcher's leadership at home and abroad secures her place in history. When we look back to 1979, the year she led the Conservative Party into office, the United Kingdom, like the United States, was suffering through a period of intense economic and social stress. British unemployment was increasing; inflation was approaching 20 percent; productivity, which had been stagnant for years, showed no sign of improving. Britain's best minds were often seeking economic opportunity abroad and frequent labor unrest made economic policy decisions difficult to implement.
I will not recite the impressive evidence showing how brilliantly the Prime Minister has succeeded over the last 9 years in leading Great Britain to a renaissance of both economy and spirit. They need no elaboration. Through her force of character, her determination to wrest Britain from her doldrums, her personal example of hard work and standing up for what is right, Margaret Thatcher reminded us of the crucial role strong leadership plays in a democracy.
When the Prime Minister applied her formidable talents to foreign policy, the results were much the same. She approached Great Britain's role among nations with a clear vision of what she wished to accomplish and how she intended to go about it. Central to her view of the world and to mine is the NATO alliance, an alliance of mutual security and shared responsibilities. Together the nations of NATO have succeeded in doing what almost no one would have dreamed impossible—or possible. I don't need the ""im"" on there. We have preserved the peace and provided the foundation for the longest period of growth and prosperity in Europe's history.
Today we're faced with a Soviet leadership eager for a change and for better relations with the West. We stand ready to work with the Soviets to resolve our differences. But we must not lose sight of the policies and vision that have served us well in the past, and that the spirit and leadership of Prime Minister Thatcher have strengthened and sustained. And we must not lose hold of her patience in pursuit of our long-term objectives: vigilance in defense of our liberties and determination in advancing the cause of human rights. Beyond Europe's boundaries, Britain and America are working together to advance an ideal, the return to democracy for many nations that have lost it. We're encouraging a democratic tide around the world: in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and even the new stirrings in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The Prime Minister was already well established in office when I began my first term almost 8 years ago. As I prepare to depart this office in January, I take considerable satisfaction in knowing that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at Number 10 Downing Street, and will be there to offer President Bush her friendship, cooperation, and advice.
She's a world leader in every meaning of the word. And Nancy and I are proud to claim the Thatchers as our friends, just as America is proud to claim the United Kingdom as a friend and ally. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand to join me in expressing admiration and appreciation for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and in raising a toast to Her Majesty the Queen.
Audience members. Hear! Hear!
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. First, let me say a heartfelt thank you for the magnificent hospitality which you and Mrs. Reagan have extended us this evening and throughout the visit. I think we all realize this is a very special occasion and we're all delighted to be here with you. And thank you, too, for giving us the honor of being the first official guests in the beautifully transformed Blair House. It really is marvelous. And I would like to thank all of those who took part in doing it up. I hope Anthony Acland will forgive me for saying that it surpasses even that modest little log cabin up Massachusetts Avenue. [Laughter]
Now, Mr. President, I have a particular feel this evening. You were so very generous in your remarks about me, then very kindly said that I was still going to be around. And I think the important thing about this evening is that we all want to pay a very great tribute to you for your Presidency for which we're all so grateful. And I'm really rather proud that it falls to the 49th Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to pay a great tribute to the 40th President of the United States.
Now that is quite historic. There haven't been many times when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has been Prime Minister throughout two consecutive Presidencies of the same person in the United States. Indeed there are only three of us so far. One was Pitt the Younger, who was in Number 10 Downing Street while George Washington was President. Lord Liverpool was also Prime Minister throughout the whole time of James Monroe as President. And the third one is me. [Laughter] And fortunately, I'm here to pay tribute to you, sir.
And as I look back over the past 8 years of our time in office together, what I remember best—I remember the dark days of the early part of this decade when both our countries were grappling with inflation and recession. You referred to it in your speech. And when you told me, at the British Embassy in 1981, that for all our economic difficulties we would be home safe and soon enough—it's a lovely phrase. Only you could have thought of it—home safe and soon enough. We could never be wholly without economic problems, but you can rightly take tremendous pride in the 71 continuous months of expansion of the American economy.
I remember, too, your brave words in the British Parliament a year later, words which have echoed round the world, when you asked a question, ""What kind of people do we think we are?""—and answered it by proclaiming, ""Free people, worthy of freedom, and determined not only to remain so, but to help others gain their freedom, too."" I remember also your historic address in another ancient hall in London almost exactly 6 years later. Your report on your summit meeting in Moscow was an inspiration to all who heard it. But more than that, you gave us that day your own declaration of faith in the principles which have inspired your political life. And your words illumined the centuries of history residing in Guildhall's ancient stones.
And I remember vividly the feeling of sheer joy at your election 8 years ago-knowing that we thought so much alike, believed in so many of the same things, and convinced that together we could get our countries back on their feet, restore their values, and create a safer and yet a better world. Together we've been able to demonstrate the truth of Winston Churchill's words about our two peoples in the House of Commons in the last days of the war, when there in the House, he said this: ""As long as our people act in absolute faith and honor to each other and to all other nations, they need fear none and they need fear nothing.""
Mr. President, you've been more than a staunch ally and wise counselor; you've also been a wonderful friend to me and my country. A friend whose cheerful bravery in the face of personal danger and of illness overcome we have all admired, and whose optimism and kindness have never been worn down by the pressures and preoccupations of your high office. Mr. President, it's when you believe in something as strongly as you do that you are given strength to take you through difficult times. And your belief has taken you through those difficult times.
Ten years ago, Mr. President, in a letter to a young Republican, you explained what it meant to be an American, and in describing the personality of the people of this land, you cited Winston again, Winston Churchill's observation that Americans seem to be the only men who can laugh and fight at the same time. [Laughter] Mr. President, you are one of those men—a combination of true valor and gentle good humor.
In celebrating your qualities and achievements, I also pay tribute to that special person who stood by your side in all your endeavors. You don't need me to tell you, Mr. President, that in the First Lady of the United States you've had a companion and partner whose charm, dignity, and quiet but sure courage have won the hearts of millions. We all thank her for the lead she's given in the war against drugs. She's inspired not only the young people of America, but the whole world. Nancy, for that, and for so many other things, we salute you, too.
Looking back on it all, what do we see? I can do no better, Mr. President, than repeat your own favorite verdict on a film script. ""That story,"" Sam Goldwyn once said, ""is wonderful! It's magnificent! It's prolific!"" [Laughter] So, too, Mr. President, have been the Reagan years. And we draw strength from the knowledge that your successor is someone who represents all that is best in America, whose loyalties to its values and its institutions is unswerving. We warmly congratulate you, Mr. Vice President and Barbara, on your victory. And we look forward to further great achievements under your Presidency and to working with you as a true and trusted friend.
Mr. President, the nature of mankind is such that the struggle for freedom can never be over. But it's a tribute and a testament to your Presidency that, as you leave office and make your way westward, back to California, we know that you have brought to fulfillment the famous prophesy of an English poet: ""And not by eastern windows only, when daylight comes, comes in the light; in front the sun climbs slow, how slowly. But westward, look. The land is bright.""
Ladies and gentlemen, the President-the President and Nancy.

state-dinners,Donald J. Trump,"November 09, 2017","
President Xi. The Honorable President Trump and Mrs. Trump, ladies and gentleman, dear friends: Good evening. As we often say in China, what a joy it is to have friends come from afar. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, I once again extend a warm welcome to you, President Trump, on your state visit to China.
Although there is a vast ocean between China and the United States, distance has never prevented our two great nations from coming together. And we have never stopped our efforts to pursue friendship and win-win cooperation. Forty-five years ago, President Nixon visited China, a visit that reopened the door of exchanges between China and the United States. As he rightly pointed before leaving China, it was a week that changed the world. Since then, thanks to the joint efforts of several generations of leaders and the people of our two countries, historic progress has been made in China-U.S. relations. It has benefited our two peoples. Indeed, it has changed the world.
How time flies. Over the past 45 years, historic changes have taken place in the world, in China, and in China-U.S. relations. The cold war is a thing of the past. The world today is experiencing tremendous progress, profound transformation, and major adjustments. China has embarked on path of reform and opening up, and socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era.
China and the United States—once walked with animosity—have grown into a community with our interests closely converging. Today, our two countries share far more and broader common interests, as well as greater and stronger responsibilities in upholding global peace and promoting common development. The strategic dimension and global influence of China-U.S. relationship have continued to grow.
President Trump, your state visit to China is another event of historic importance. Over the past 2 days, we have had in-depth exchange of views on how China and the United States should seize the opportunity, rise up to the challenges, and open up new grounds in our relations. Together, we have mapped out a blueprint for advancing China-U.S. relations. We both agree that China and the United States should remain partners, not rivals. We both agree that when we work together, we can accomplish many great things to the benefit of our two countries and the whole world.
I have also briefed President Trump on the 19th International Congress of the Communist Party of China, and this is my message: The 19th Party Congress will bring even more opportunities for China's cooperation with the United States and other countries. Indeed, the Chinese dream is closely connected with dreams of people of all other countries in the world.
The Honorable President Trump and Mrs. Trump, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: One has to make—[inaudible]—efforts to fulfill one's dream. As an old Chinese adage goes, ""No distance, not even remote mountains and vast oceans can ever prevent people with perseverance from reaching their destination."" Benjamin Franklin, one of America's Founding Fathers, also said, ""He who can have patience, can have what he will."" It is my firm conviction that China-U.S. relations face limited challenges, but boundless potential for growth. With perseverance, we can surely write a new chapter in the history of China-U.S. relations. With perseverance, our two great nations will definitely make new contributions to creating a better future for mankind.
Now please join me in a toast to the prosperity of China and the United States and the well-being of our people. To the friendship between China and the United States, and between our people and to the health of you, President Trump, Mrs. Trump, and all our sides present.
Cheers.
[At this point, President Xi offered a toast.]
Moderator. Now I would like to invite President Trump to come to the podium to give a toast.
President Trump. Thank you so much. That was so nice. And this has been an extraordinary few days. President Xi, your generous words, I must say, Melania—we both want to express our gratitude to you and Madam Peng for the extraordinary hospitality that you've shown us from the moment we arrived in your magnificent country, China.
Yesterday we visited the Forbidden City, which stands as a proud symbol of China's rich culture and majestic spirit. Your nation is a testament to thousands of years of vibrant, living history. And today it was a tremendous honor to be greeted by the Chinese delegation right here at the Great Hall of the People. This moment in history presents both our nations with an incredible opportunity to advance peace and prosperity alongside other nations all around the world. In the words of a Chinese proverb, ""We must carry forward the cause and forge ahead into the future."" I am confident that we can realize this wonderful vision, a vision that will be so good and, in fact, so great for both China and the United States.
Though we come from different places and faraway lands, there is much that binds the East and West. Both of our countries were built by people of great courage, strong culture, and a desire to trek across the unknown into great danger. But they overcame. The people of the United States have a very deep respect for the heritage of your country and the noble traditions of its people. Your ancient values bring past and future together into the present. So beautiful.
It is my hope that the proud spirits of the American and Chinese people will inspire our efforts to achieve a more just, secure, and peaceful world, a future worthy of the sacrifices of our ancestors and the dreams of our children.
In a moment, we will view a video of my granddaughter Arabella reciting traditional Chinese songs and poetry about your country's serene beauty and treasured customs. Our children so often remind us of our shared humanity and true dignity.
President Xi, on behalf of the American people, I offer this to toast to you: To the people of your country and to a friendship that will only grow stronger and stronger over many years to come.
Thank you. This has been a great honor to be with you both. We very much appreciate it.
[President Trump offered a toast.]

President and Mrs. Kuchma, to all of our hosts, on behalf of all the Americans here, let me say that we are glad to be here and we thank you, Mr. President, for your warm remarks.
Mr. President, on my first trip to the Ukraine, I only visited the lounge at Boryspil Airport, and you promised me when we met in November that the hospitality would be even better in Kiev. Thank you for keeping your word and for this wonderful welcome.
Mr. President and distinguished guests, we had a very good meeting here today, but perhaps the most important thing which happened today, which both of us worked on, occurred in New York where the nations of the world made history. By indefinitely extending the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we have taken a critical step in making the American people, Ukrainian people, and the people of the world more secure. More important, this action will build a better future for our children, for future generations.
For 25 years, the NPT has been the cornerstone of global efforts to reduce the dangers of nuclear weapons. Making the treaty permanent opens a new and more hopeful chapter in our history, a time when all nations will be more secure. We owe a great debt of thanks to the men and women who've worked so hard to make this possible.
This achievement was key goal of our foreign policy in the United States this year. And I want to say a special word of thanks to the representatives of my Government who worked so hard for this day.
It is especially fitting that we celebrate this event in Kiev, for Ukraine has been at the forefront of those nations that have been striving to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons. By your decision to eliminate the nuclear arsenal on your territory, to bring the START I agreement into force, and to adhere to the NPT, Ukrainian people have made a major contribution to reducing the nuclear dangers in Europe and throughout the world.
I once again want to thank President Kuchma for his brave and wise leadership. Over the last few days, we have spoken a great deal about the hardship and the heroism in the Great War of 50 years ago. This evening I would like to pay tribute to the courage and endurance of the Ukrainian people today. After a century of totalitarian rule, famine, and war, you have emerged to freedom and independence and set for yourselves the highest goals. In the face of a difficult, often wrenching transition, you have persevered and added honor to your nation.
I salute you, Mr. President, because you have played such an important role in maintaining the resolve of your people. Every democratically elected leader knows it is difficult to pursue a course that causes pain in the short run, even if it is best for the people in the long run. Mr. President, you have carried forth without wavering. An American President can look back on the experience of his predecessors over more than 200 years and know that others have walked this path before. But you are forging a new democratic tradition, untested and unknown but based on your judgment and your convictions. You have written a record of achievement and shown a determination that will be remembered long into the future.
This record should not and will not go unanswered. You have challenged us, and we are responding with strong support for Ukrainian reform. And we will continue to stand by you and work with Ukraine to fulfill its ambitions to become a prosperous democracy. Our legacy will not only be Government-to-Government programs but a genuine partnership between Ukrainian and American citizens, equal to the challenges of the coming century.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us raise a glass to the health and happiness of President and Mrs. Kuchma and to Ukraine, where one of Europe's oldest nations is building a vibrant new democracy, and to the growing friendship between our peoples.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"January 05, 1978","
Mr. President and Mrs. Giscard d'Estaing, distinguished leaders of France, friends who have made our brief visit here so inspirational and so enjoyable:
We have said many times since arriving in France how closely related our nations have been since the origins of our republics. In addition to the heroism shown by warriors who fought together in times of conflict and trial, we also had intimate relations that existed between the early leaders of our country and the leaders and the people of France.
Two of our earliest Presidents served here during their tutelage for leadership, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. Benjamin Franklin, another great leader of our country, served here as Ambassador of the United States in its formative stage. Unbeknown to the Continental Congress and other national leaders, Benjamin Franklin was also an Ambassador from my own State of Georgia. We paid him, secretly, $15 a month. [Laughter] I understand he did our work at night, along with many other interesting things. [Laughter]
Benjamin Franklin made a very interesting statement during the time he was Ambassador here which I would like to read. ""God grant that not only the love of liberty but a thorough knowledge of the rights of man may pervade all the nations of the earth so that a philosopher may set his foot anywhere on its surface and say 'This is my country.'"" the interesting thing is that he said this, ""a thorough knowledge of the rights of man,"" years before the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
As President Giscard d'Estaing has already said, the first treaty of independence between Great Britain and the United States was signed here at Versailles. And President Wilson came back here in 1919, at this very place, to sign the Treaty of Versailles, establishing again both peace and a worldwide commitment to freedom and liberty.
It is difficult, perhaps, for citizens of France to know or to comprehend the deep feeling of brotherhood, mutual purpose, and appreciation held in the hearts of Americans for what your nation has done for us.
In the early years of our young nation, Lafayette was still a great hero in our country. In my own State of Georgia, he traveled widely, visiting the cities of Augusta, Sparta, Milledgeville, Savannah, and we even know that he visited a small Indian village between Georgia and Alabama very close to where I live. We have both a city and a county in my own State named after Lafayette.
The Declaration of Independence and the Declaration of the Rights of Man initiated the startling concept throughout the world of basic human rights. Since I've been here, President Giscard d'Estaing and I have discussed some of the aspects that go with the definition of human rights. One of the most important is that of worldwide peace.
Another is economic benefit, which guarantees free people a chance for food, shelter, health, education, and a chance for their spirits to grow.
Another is to strengthen the ties of friendship, such as those which exist between the people of France and the people of the United States of America.
Another is to exhibit bravery, not through coercion but voluntarily for a worthy cause. We honored this type of bravery today near the beaches of Normandy.
Another characteristic, of course, is the appreciation of beauty. And today we've had a reaffirmation of our consciousness of the beauty that pervades the nation of France—not only the countryside through which we traveled, but this palace, the home that your President has permitted us to use for these two nights. And this afternoon, we had a chance to see the beauty of your artists whom we admire so much in our own country.
If France and the United States, bound so closely together now, can continue to exhibit the bravery and the commitment which we have shown in the past, then human rights will be the historical inevitability of our times.
On behalf of the people of America, I would like, therefore, to propose a toast to President Giscard, to the people and the greatness of France.

Mr. President, Prime Minister, and distinguished guests, Laura and I thank you for such a warm welcome. Thank you for this wonderful dinner tonight. We're grateful for your hospitality, and we appreciate the opportunity to visit your beautiful country.
India is home to a proud civilization. Thousands of years ago, the people of this region built great cities, established trading routes with distant lands, and created wonders of art and architecture. Its reputation for wealth and wisdom attracted many brave explorers, one of them never did complete his journey, and he ended up in America.
Like India, America respects faith and family and is rich in diversity. Americans are proud that our Nation is home to more than 2 million individuals of Indian decent. Both our nations can take pride in their achievements. People from India serve with distinction in American businesses, in the sciences, and the arts. The contributions of our Indian American community have made America a better nation, and they've helped strengthen our ties with India.
The relationship between our two nations is strong, and it rests on a firm foundation. We share common interests rooted in common belief that freedom can change lives and transform nations. Today, our two democracies have formed a strategic partnership to bring the benefits of liberty to others, to expand global prosperity through free and fair trade, and to confront the challenges of our time. As great nations, we now have an opportunity to lead, and America values the leadership of the great nation of India.
Mr. President, again, Laura and I express our deepest heartfelt thanks. It's my honor now to toast to you, sir, and to the great nation of India.

state-dinners,Franklin D. Roosevelt,"August 24, 1944","
Only four members of my Cabinet are here tonight; the others are off on holiday or for some other reason, but I am glad to say that half of them have been in Iceland. The Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Treasury have been there, so in having been there they know more about Iceland personally than I do. However, as I said to the President, I have always been a student of Iceland.
About two years ago there was put up to me the great question as to where Iceland was. Was it in the European hemisphere or the American hemisphere? And I used the judgment of Solomon, I said it was in both hemispheres—which is true. To be quite frank, chiefly for practical reasons. But it belongs in both hemispheres, it belongs to the life of both hemispheres. And in the future—this is a prediction—I think that Iceland will always be considered, for certain practical reasons, a part of the Americas, and a part of Europe.
For practical reasons we all know Iceland is necessary to our defense, illustrated some three years ago when there was real danger, when Germany was not only on the offensive but was overrunning a greater part of the world every day. And there was the danger in those days- when all of us were on the defensive, and I am speaking from the American point of view that Iceland would be occupied by the Germans.
And on that particular occasion, whether it was constitutional or not the historians will determine a hundred years from now, the State Department took up with the Icelandic Government-which was then closely associated with Denmark—the possibility of our making sure, by sending troops to Iceland, that Germany could not use it as a ""fait accompli"" against this continent. We were selfish. We couldn't afford to let Germany use Iceland as a base from which to bomb or send expeditions against the American continent.
And therefore, because of the cordial relations that existed, we were able to make a perfectly legal agreement with the Government of Iceland by which we sent in our troops. We said quite frankly, and we meant it as the President knows, that when this danger of a German occupation of Iceland was over and the world returns to peace, we not only would recognize but we would work for the complete independence of what is the Iceland, not of today but of a thousand years back, the Iceland that essentially has always been independent, a Nation—and this is something that perhaps some people could use to some advantage—Irish in its origin.
I was asking the President, who incidentally is the first President of their Republic—we haven't had many, thirty-two, that's all—who were the first people in Iceland, were they Esquimaux? No, an Esquimau was never there. He said the first people in Iceland were the Irish, which is extremely interesting. Not only the Irish, by the founding of a monastery in Iceland, but the first white people- as we call them—in Iceland were the Irish, followed after that, after the Vikings had come—by another influx of Irish, including an Irish princess, the President said. So there you are.
And from that time on, for more than a thousand years- we celebrated their thousandth anniversary a short time ago- we have had an independent Nation in Iceland, the oldest of our civilization in all the world, with a parliamentary government, with complete independence in the best sense of the word, not only making their own laws but living their own lives, not only their own government but a people's government, who said what they wanted, and who always had their way, including the right to elect the present President, who incidentally- probably a good thought, which I won't press- was elected unanimously. (Laughter) I catch the eyes of Senator Vandenberg. (More laughter) But that is the way they elected their first President.
And, of course, we did, too, in 1788-9. We elected George Washington unanimously, and he was the first and the last that was thus elected. So I warn you for my colleagues, if you should run for a second or a third or a fourth term, you mustn't expect to be elected unanimously. (More laughter)
And so Iceland is a great deal more than a name in mythology. In the last few years, Iceland was a name to us. One and eight tenths percent of our trade to Iceland went that way. Things differ from time to time. Today it is 58 percent, something like that, due primarily to the war—we might just as well admit that. But at the same time, and thinking of the future, we want to keep Iceland on the map, that is the great point, always. The whole of civilization wants Iceland as the cradle of the oldest Republic that has ever happened—something to teach the world a lesson. You run your own universities, you are friends with all the Scandinavians, and those who are in Iceland too.
But you run into the curious fact that last year or the year before—a few years ago—Sweden issued stamps to celebrate the freedom of the Swedes from Danish control. Remember that. The Norwegians have insisted on their independence from Sweden. The Norwegians and the Danes are first cousins. You have Scandinavian blood, with a very good Irish admixture. And, on the whole, in the family of Nations, the American people have a great deal of Scandinavian blood in them, a lot of them—there are a great many Swedes, and Norwegians, and some Danish and a few Icelanders here. But we want the future to look at it from the point of view that we are all of the same basic stock, fundamentally.
And we want intermarriage. I am alluding now to a number of people—several thousand have already—who are now under the jurisdiction of Secretary Stimson, who are related by marriage with Icelandic girls, and who are going to stay in Iceland, if you let them, after the war. It's all right. Now, I don't protest against that one bit. We like it, and we hope that some of their children will come over here and become a part of the American family.
Now on the other more practical things, like trade, I was saying to his Minister a few minutes ago there is an American habit of cocktails, but we haven't yet acquired the Scandinavian habit of the things that go before cocktails. Don't sell us cod liver oil, I don't like cod liver oil—(laughter)—but go into the things that pay more money. Send us some smoked salmon, and things of that kind that go well before the cocktails. In that way you can help, and we can help, by general trade between Iceland and the United States. After all, things are going to go by trade a great deal in the future.
It has been easier, because of the shorter distance, to send your hors d'oeuvres to England, but they don't know a good hors d'oeuvre when they see it. Please send us some, for we are very fond of them. And specialize in them, not the vulgar stuff, but the specials. You can send us wool, for you have a special kind of wool we don't know of here. And so trade, if we go at it from the point of view of building it up on special lines—Iceland is small, and therefore you have to specialize- I think it can be done.
And in the days to come—I am not speaking about this treaty or that treaty or the other treaty they are talking about now, but it depends very largely on the spirit, very much on the spirit. If the spirit is all right behind the objective, greater friendship and greater trade, we can get somewhere. You have your politics, Mr. President, and you have a legislature, the oldest legislature in the world, incidentally. Over here I have my politics—I am not taking a very. great part in them—and I have a legislature, a very young legislature, it's only 160 years old. They learn with age. (Laughter) And so I have great hopes that when this thing comes up, the Senate of the United States which has a great deal to do with foreign policy will accept a treaty of trade and friendship,—all-inclusive—with the Republic of Iceland, without saying ""No"" just because they don't like the President of the United States.
Now that's an ideal, and perhaps my hope will be justified. Time alone will tell.
But, at least, in welcoming you to Washington, you know that the present President has his heart in the right place.
And so I drink to the first President of Iceland.

state-dinners,George Bush,"July 20, 1991","
Mr. President and Mrs. Ozal and ladies and gentlemen. Let me begin by thanking President Ozal for inviting us over here to see this wonderful country. We were standing outside of Ataturk's tomb this morning, and I couldn't help but think of the parallels between the founder of the modern Turkish Republic -- whose name means ""Father of the Turks"" -- and the man we Americans call the Father of our Country, George Washington.
Both were great generals; both were great leaders. And both used their words, their times, and their opportunities to build great nations. Each knew that to win a war one must secure the peace. And each had a vision for his country's future that, through courage, labor, and selfless determination, became the nation's destiny.
And then, as now, we believe in what Ataturk called ""peace at home and peace abroad."" We know that protecting peace sometimes means being willing to defend it. That's why we've worked together in NATO for close to 40 years. That's why we fought together in the Korean war. And that's why we stood together to reverse the occupation of Kuwait.
There were many people -- many men and women -- responsible for the success of the international coalition and the liberation of Kuwait. But I firmly believe that no one provided greater leadership or clarity of purpose than President Turgut Ozal. I know because we talked together by phone countless times. And he never flinched, and he was always courageous and farsighted.
Let me add, sir, that our respect and gratitude certainly extends also to Turkey's military leaders -- the Turkish General Staff -- who displayed uncommon dedication to the coalition's objectives. It was a comfort for all of us in Washington to know that when the United Nations decided to take that step and impose sanctions against Iraq, Turkey would not hesitate to do what was right. I want you to know -- and on this one I speak confidently on behalf of the American people -- that Turkey's role in the Gulf crisis has not, and will not be, forgotten.
Let me also say that we know the cost of your courage. Your Turkey's incurred enormous damage -- especially in the southeast -- from its compliance with UN sanctions, its decision to deploy troops, and its generous relief assistance to hundreds of thousands of displaced people camped along its borders.
As we look ahead, let's use the last year as a model of cooperation. As allies, Mr. President, we must expand and deepen our relationship -- we must create a new strategic relationship.
It's been said that great tasks and important missions are accomplished only through cooperative efforts. And that's why I talked today with President Ozal and Prime Minister Yilmaz of strengthening the bonds that link our countries.
Turkey's genius can advance not only prosperity at home but also peace abroad. So, let us build a new future together: a future of peace in the Middle East, a future of peace on Cyprus, and peace between two great countries -- Turkey and Greece -- led by wise and responsible men. And let us work together to build a U.S.-Turkish relationship with the knowledge that our paths are common, our interests and values are intertwined, and our fate, as free and democratic peoples, will be always linked.
Mr. President, let our path be straight and true. Let us achieve the real peace that Ataturk and General Washington dreamt of. And let us enrich this generation, and all generations to come.
And may I ask all the guests here to join me now in a toast to the health of the President and Mrs. Ozal, and to the great and strong relationship between the United States and Turkey. And thank you, sir, for your hospitality.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"July 31, 1969","
Mr. President, Your Excellencies, and our friends from India and the United States:
I want to thank you first, Mr. President, for your very gracious and generous remarks, and to tell you, indeed, though this visit is a short one, that Mrs. Nixon and I have already felt the warmth of the friendship of the people of India.
We regret that we have only this brief time to be here, but we think that had we only planned this trip to come to India for one day, it would have been worthwhile-worthwhile because of the opportunity that was provided to see and know this country again; but, more important, for the opportunity that was provided to see and know the people of India and the leaders of India, and to talk to them face to face about some of the great problems that we face together.
It was appropriate that you spoke of peace and progress and cooperation. As you noted, this journey that I am now on is a journey in quest of peace. This afternoon I had a very great privilege, that of laying a wreath, a memorial, to a great man of peace, one of the truly great men of all time and of all nations.
It was an honor for me, a great honor, to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi, in this, his centennial year.
In responding to your remarks, Mr. President, I find myself reflecting on the lessons of Gandhi. If I would not presume before this audience that knew him much better than I, I would like to talk about those lessons, what they mean to me, what they mean to the world.
Forty years ago, speaking from a personal standpoint, when I was graduated from high school, my grandmother, who was a devout Quaker and a deeply believing pacifist, gave me as a graduation present a biography of Gandhi. I learned to know him through that book.
And since then I, of course, like many throughout the world who never met him, knew him through his writings, knew him for what he stood for Gandhi's life was inspired by truths which know no boundary of space or time, because they are eternal truths.
There is a greatness which transcends the ordinary meaning of that word, a greatness at once mysterious and self-evident, a greatness beyond the trappings of power, beyond the opinions of men, a greatness of the spirit. Such a greatness was his.
He was, above all, a man of peace, who knew both the need for peace and the power of peace. He once wrote: ""Love is the strongest force the world possesses and yet it is the humblest imaginable."" Love was at the center of his greatness: a love of India, a love of mankind, a love of peace; and he forged it into a power that moved nations and transformed the world.
As we reflect on his greatness, it is appropriate that we reflect also on the nature of peace.
The concept of peace is as old as civilization, but the requirements of peace change with a changing world. Today we need a new definition of peace--one which recognizes not only the many threats to peace, but also the many dimensions of peace.
Peace is much more than the absence of war and, as Gandhi's life reminds us, peace is not the absence of change. Gandhi was a disciple of peace. He also was an architect of profound and far-reaching change. He stood for the achievement of change through peaceful methods; for belief in the power of conscience; for faith in the dignity and grace of the human spirit, and in the rights of man.
In today's rapidly changing world, there is no such thing as a static peace or a stagnant order. To stand still is to build pressures that are bound to explode the peace; and more fundamentally, to stand still is to deny the universal aspirations of mankind. Peace today must be a creative force, a dynamic process, that embraces both the satisfaction of man's material needs and the fulfillment of his spiritual needs.
The pursuit of peace means building a structure of stability within which the rights of each nation are respected: the rights of national independence, of self-determination, the right to be secure within its own borders, to be free from intimidation.
This structure of stability can take many forms. Some may choose to join in formal alliances; some may choose to go their own independent way. We respect India's policy of nonalignment, its determination to play its role in the search for peace in its own way. What matters is not how peace is preserved, but that it be preserved; not the formal structure of treaties, but the informal network of common ideals and common purposes that together become a fabric of peace. What matters is not whether the principles of international behavior these represent are written or unwritten principles, but rather that they are accepted principles.
Peace demands restraint. The truest peace expresses itself in self-restraint in the voluntary acceptance, whether by men or by nations, of those basic rules of behavior that are rooted in mutual respect and demonstrated in mutual forbearance. When one nation claims the right to dictate the internal affairs of another, there is no peace.
When nations arm for the purpose of threatening their weaker neighbors, there is no peace.
There is true peace only when the weak are as safe as the strong; only when the poor can share the benefits of progress with the rich; and only when those who cherish freedom can exercise freedom.
Gandhi touched something deep in the spirit of man. He forced the world to confront its conscience, and the world is better for having done so. Yet we still hear other cries, other appeals to our collective conscience as a community of man.
The process of peace is one of answering those cries--yet doing so in a manner that preserves the right of each people to seek its own destiny in its own way, and strengthens the principles of national sovereignty and national integrity on which the structure of peace among nations depends.
However fervently we believe in our own ideals, we cannot impose those ideals on others and still call ourselves men of peace. But we can assist others who share those ideals, and who seek to give them life. As fellow members of the world community, we can assist the people of India in their heroic struggle to make the world's most populous democracy a model of orderly development and progress.
There is a relationship between peace and freedom. Because man yearns for peace, when the people are free to choose, their choice is more likely to be peace among nations; and because man yearns for freedom, when peace is secure, the thrust of social evolution is toward greater freedom within nations.
Essentially, peace is rooted in a sense of community, in a recognition of the common destiny of mankind, in a respect for the common dignity of mankind, and in the patterns of cooperation that make common enterprises possible. This is why the new patterns of regional cooperation emerging in Asia can be bulwarks of peace.
In the final analysis, however, peace is a spiritual condition. All religions pray for it. Man must build it by reason and patience.
On the moon, now, is a plaque bearing these simple words: ""We came in peace for all mankind.""
Mahatma Gandhi came in peace to all mankind.
In this spirit, then, let us all together commit ourselves to a new concept of peace:
--A peace that combines continuity and change, stability and progress, tradition and innovation.
--A peace that turns the wonders of science to the service of man.
--A peace that is both a condition and a process; a state of being and a pattern of change; a renunciation of war and a constructive alternative to revolution.
--A peace that values diversity and respects the right of different peoples to live by different systems--and freely to choose the systems they live by.
--A peace that rests on the determination of those who value it to preserve it, but that looks forward to the reduction of arms and the ascendancy of reason.
--A peace responsive to the human spirit, respectful of the divinely inspired dignity of man; one that lifts the eyes of all to what man in brotherhood can accomplish, and that now, as man crosses the threshold of the heavens, is more necessary than ever. It is, then, in a spirit of peace, in a spirit of brotherhood, and in a spirit of confident hope, that I ask you to join me in a toast to the Acting President, the Prime Minister, and the people of India, a nation rich in spirit, proud of its heritage, advancing toward a future bright with promise, and marked by destiny to play an historic role in man's progress toward that peace we all so fervently seek.

President Aylwin, thank you for your hospitality and for your generosity during my visit to your beautiful country. We first met earlier this year at the White House, and I hope we will have many more opportunities to exchange views and to work together.
In accepting Ambassador Silva's credentials as Chile's representative in the United States, I said: ""We are happy for Chile and optimistic about its future. Your country's deep democratic tradition, its strong economy, and the richly deserved reputation of the Chilean people for dynamism and creativity reinforce our confidence."" I shouldn't have been so restrained. Now that I've had the opportunity to visit Chile, I am even more convinced that Chile's future is bright. You deserve your reputation as an economic model for other countries in the region and in the world. Your economic growth is the pride of Latin America, and your commitment to market-based solutions inspires the hemisphere.
It is a pleasure to hear freedom spoken of as the recognized right of all people not only to elect their own government but to control their own destiny and follow their dreams. And it's a pleasure to listen to the language of optimism: to hear trade barriers spoken of as obstacles to eliminate and openness as the path to prosperity. Today I've heard economic growth and development discussed not as ends in themselves but as the means to raise the standard of living and to broaden opportunity for all Chile's citizens, as the means to a better life for her people.
Earlier this year, Mr. President, you observed, ""Chileans, with a tradition of democratic institutions, of respect for human rights, of the rule of law, have chosen to remake their society based on those values which honored their country in the past. At the same time,"" you went on, ""we want to seek progress and economic development based on an open and competitive system in which all creative initiatives find space for expression.""
And so, it is with a noble spirit and honorable values that the Chilean people are remaking their society, a society founded on democracy and economic liberty. To achieve this, the people of Chile have freely chosen leaders of vision and courage. And you, President Aylwin, are an outstanding example. Earlier today, when I met your children and your grandchildren, I got a glimpse of the values underlying your leadership: family and faith in God and faith in the future.
To the bright future of this nation; to the freedom-loving people of Chile; to all the government officials who came to greet me at the airport; and to you, Mr. President, I raise my glass in a toast: May the renewed friendship between our two great nations remain as strong and healthy as the optimism that characterizes our two peoples.
Thank you, and may God bless your great country.

state-dinners,Joseph R. Biden,"September 11, 2023","
Moderator. Today, on the occasion of the state visit to Vietnam by President Joe Biden, President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, His Excellency Vo Van Thuong, solemnly hosts the banquet—[inaudible]—President Joe Biden and the high-level delegation of the United States of America.
We are very honored to invite Your Excellency, President Vo Van Thuong, to deliver his welcome remarks.
President Thuong. Honorable President Joseph Biden, distinguished American and Vietnamese guests, on behalf of the state and people of Vietnam, once again, I would like to warmly welcome you, President Joseph Biden of the United States of America, to Vietnam on your first state visit.
Your visit is truly significant. It builds on the very special character of Vietnam-U.S. relations. You are the first U.S. President to visit Vietnam at the invitation of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguyễn Phú Trọng.
During this visit, you have also joined General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng to announce the upgrade of relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership for peace, cooperation, and sustainable development. This is truly a new page in the relationship between our two countries, an enduring, stable, long-term framework that opens up a vast space for further development of the bond between us for decades to follow.
Mr. President, distinguished guests, a mere 5 months after national independence, President Hồ Chí Minh penned a letter addressing President Truman, expressing the desire to establish a bond of full cooperation with the United States. As history would have it, this desire had to confront countless turmoil and challenges, all of such we have overcome. And today we can speak with joy that never before has the relationship between our two countries reached such flourishing height as today.
From former enemies to comprehensive strategic partners, this is truly a model in the history of international relations as to how reconciliation and relationship-building should proceed after a war. This is a result of the efforts to walk past such challenges and vicissitudes of history by so many generations of our country's leaders and people.
Over the past 50 years, we have witnessed events of such significance in the relationship and the unprecedented quantum leaps in our relationship. There have been momentous achievements in various areas of cooperation between Vietnam and the U.S., from economic, trade, investment ties and in education and training cooperation, to various mechanisms for dialogue and joint efforts across different domains and sectors.
Across the comprehensive areas of cooperation between us, I would like to specifically call to attention the truly pride-worthy and striking achievements in our cooperation in addressing war legacy issues.
Allow me to cite the dioxin remediation projects in Da Nang and Bien Hoa airports; support given by the U.S. in various ways to Vietnamese persons with disabilities, including Agent Orange victims of the second and third generation; and the removal of UXOs left behind after the war.
And most recently, for the first time, our two countries have started working together to conduct forensic identification of yet unidentified remains of Vietnamese war martyrs. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to generations of U.S. administrations and people—and to you, Mr. President, and the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden—for your active support for Vietnam in the humanitarian field.
On our part, since 1973, Vietnam has actively conducted unilateral searches for American MIAs. In 1988, both sides commenced the first joint mission. After half a century, the full cooperation between Vietnam and U.S. in this area is still growing stronger and stronger. Many American MIAs lost in high mountains or deep oceans, even the—on grounds hardly ever tread, have since been found—their remains returned to their home.
Mr. President, distinguished guests, to quote Secretary General Nguyễn Phú Trọng, ""Set aside the past, overcome differences, build on similarities, look to the future.""
You have also pledged your support for a strong, independent, resilient, and prosperous Vietnam. I have a strong belief that building on the length of Vietnam-U.S. relations with mutual trust and respect, and given the new driver we have established during your visit, the strategic—comprehensive strategic partnership for peace, cooperation, and sustainable development between Vietnam and the U.S. will continue to grow in strength and substance and bring concrete benefits to our two peoples, make positive contributions to peace, friendship, cooperation and sustainable development in the region and the world.
Let me take this opportunity to express my respectful gratitude to the different agencies, organizations, and individuals from both countries who, from one generation to the next, have tirelessly cultivated and nurtured the relationship between Vietnam and the U.S.
Of these very exemplary persons, I would like to especially honor the late Senator John McCain, former Senator Patrick Leahy, and Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry—truly close friends of Vietnam through the years.
Let us, in the generations to come, work together to build on these efforts to preserve, reinforce, and grow this special relationship, take it higher and further in the warm atmosphere of friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and the United States of America.
Let us raise our glasses to the happiness of the American people and the prosperity of the United States of America, to the flourishing comprehensive strategic partnership between Vietnam and the United States of America, to the good health of President Joe Biden, and to the good health of all present here today.
[At this point, President Thuong offered a toast.]
Moderator. Now we have the great honor to invite Your Excellency, Mr. Joe Biden, President of the United States of America, to respond.
President Biden. Mr. President, the great Vietnamese poet Nguyễn Du once wrote, ""In glory they made up for their past hardships, and their love got fresher and warmer each day.""
Mr. President, friends, it's an honor to be here today on this historic occasion, a day when we feel all the glory and warmth of the boundless possibilities that lie ahead, a day that may have seemed impossible not that long ago.
As a matter of fact, I was just in the other room with my very close and old friend, Tom Vallely, who is the guy who put together the Fulbright University. And he was helping me when I was a much younger man trying to get the nomination for President.
And we were sitting in a small twin-engine plane. And I looked at him, and I said, ""Tom, why are you doing this for me?"" He said, ""Because I want to fundamentally change the relationship with Vietnam."" And he had been here as a soldier. ""I want to fundamentally change that relationship."" And he's worked his whole career to do that.
And you know, for—we—as we sit side by side, Mr. President, we're reminded of the hard work we all did to get here to overcome the hardships of the past and seize the promises of the future, one of greater opportunity, dignity, security, and prosperity for all our people.
And as we trace this 50-year arc of progress between our nations, there's one common denominator: you, our people, our activities, our activists, our entrepreneurs, our scholars, our veterans, our innovators, and our leaders who never forget—like Senator, later Secretary Kerry, who was a brave soldier who fought here, but wanted, every day since then, to make it better. Everyone in both our countries who's working to make sure that people, no matter who they are, can seize potential of this moment.
I want to thank three close friends again in normalizing these relations: John Kerry, Tommy Vallely, and a close friend of the three of us—a guy who is not here today; a guy who, when he returned from Vietnam, came to work for me as a Military Aide in the United States Senate and then I convinced him he should run for United States Senate. He ran in the other party. We argued like hell from that point on, but we still loved one another. And John McCain, who I miss—we all three of us miss dearly today.
We know where there was darkness, you all found light. Where there was hardship, you found healing to bring us forward, to bring us together, to bring us to this day. It's testament to how far our countries have come, but most importantly, how far we will go in the years ahead.
And that's what comprehensive strategic partners is about—and thank you for inviting us to have that status—going forward together, tackling challenges together, facing the future together.
So please join me, if you will, in—I'd like to make a toast. I quoted a Vietnamese poet to begin with, and I'm going to quote—my colleagues in the Senate always kidded me. I was always quoting Irish poets. I quote them not because I'm Irish—because they're the best poets in the world. That's why I quote them.
But all kidding aside. There is a great quote from a man whose wife I got to know after he passed away, Seamus Heaney. And he wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy."" And this is my toast to all of you.
He said, ""History teaches us, don't hope on this side of the grave. But then, once in a lifetime, that longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.""
Here's to us making hope and history rhyme for all our people. God bless you all.
[President Biden offered a toast.]

state-dinners,George Bush,"April 04, 1989","
President Bush. Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor to welcome the President and First Lady of the Arab Republic of Egypt to the United States. And it's a pleasure for me to greet an old friend and colleague as one of my first visitors to the White House and to this, our first dinner in the State Dining Room.
These last 2 days have been productive, a time for seeking common ground in approaching the peace process, as well as a good time to discuss the bilateral issues. We've also shared some insights into each other's cultures, including the most American of pastimes, baseball. [Laughter] And my dear friend, President Mubarak, there's a great philosopher in baseball, a great baseball player named Yogi Berra. [Laughter] And Yogi Berra once said, ""You can observe a lot by just watching."" [Laughter] And, Mr. President, baseball is a game in which coordinated effort, patience, and a spirit of teamwork provide the winning edge -- in a phrase, the spirit of teamwork.
And you and I share a special bond. Both of us have been tested as seconds-in-command. Both of us have assumed the Presidency at a time when we are challenged to fulfill the promise of past diplomacy.
In fact, there have been favorable developments since your last visit to the United States, just 15 months ago. In Afghanistan, 10 years of foreign occupation have been swept away by a brave people. The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq is a first step towards lasting peace. And we have recently seen an enhanced and well-deserved recognition of Egypt's leadership role in the Arab world, a role that has been enhanced by your perseverance and your commitment to peace. And as I said yesterday, we must work to create a new atmosphere where Palestinians and Israelis put aside violence in favor of words. A dialog for peace is the best way to establish Israeli security and give the Palestinians their legitimate political rights.
Mr. President, just 1 week ago we observed the 10th anniversary of Egypt's historic peace treaty with Israel. And our task today is to extend that peace to all the nations in the Middle East. Such an undertaking will require great patience and immense trust. But I firmly believe that peace will prevail if we continue to work with a common purpose, in the spirit of teamwork. The United States, I assure you, remains willing to help in this important quest.
Mr. President and Mrs. Mubarak -- your beautiful Suzanne, I raise my glass in your honor, proud of your friendship, thankful for your leadership. And God bless you, and God bless the peoples of America and Egypt.
President Mubarak. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, dear friends, let me first express my sincere appreciation for the warm and the friendly reception which we received since we came to your lovely capital, Washington.
My meeting yesterday with you, Mr. President, has a special significance, for it is a beginning of a new era in our friendship and cooperation over the years. Over the years, and in the different roles you assume, Mr. President, you have been a great friend of Egypt and an active participant in the shaping of the Middle East future. Your thoughtful gesture of inviting me to meet with you here in Washington at this early stage, after we had met only a few weeks ago in Tokyo, did not go unnoticed. As we met with you yesterday, and with your able assistants, we look to the future with great optimism. Your deep knowledge of the region and your keen interest in promoting peace assure us of a better and safer future for the whole area.
The American people have chosen you as the torchbearer at a unique and historical junction. The whole world is yearning for an easing of tensions. People in all four corners of the world are seeking a just resolution to disputes and termination of all wars. They want to be better equipped to cope with the awesome challenge they confront today and tomorrow. Issues like underdevelopment and environment require urgent remedies.
Your pledge to make this great land a kinder and gentler nation will certainly contribute to making the whole world a kinder and gentler place for our children and the generations to come. We appreciate your role and the role of the American people as partners in peace and development in the area.
A few days ago, we celebrated, as you mentioned, Mr. President, the 10th anniversary of the peace treaty which was signed here in Washington. That event coincides with the successful conclusion of the Taba dispute, with your help and assistance. These events constitute a living testimony to the validity of the premises that nations can solve all their differences throughout negotiations and other peaceful means. On the other hand, they represent a tribute to the American role as a peacemaker and conciliator.
Over the last two decades, four distinguished Americans, namely former Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan -- and their assistants played a pivotal role in order to help the parties of the Middle East conflict achieve peace. We are grateful to these men and to every American for their genuine concern and moral commitment. Today President Bush has already begun to put the mark on the peace process, only a few weeks after he had assumed office. We have full faith in President Bush, his sense of fairness and sound judgment. Your leadership, Mr. President, and your commitment as an active partner in the peace process reinforce hope in the heart of every Arab and Israeli who yearn for peace. No one is better equipped than yourself, Mr. President, to influence the course of events in this troubled region.
Egypt is ready to work hand-in-hand with you in the pursuit of that worthy goal. With your knowledge and vision, we can develop all our friendship to a higher plateau of shared views and the common interests. Above all, we share a vision of a Middle East where all countries and people coexist in harmony and cooperate as good neighbors, ushering in a new era in which the enemies of yesterday become partners in the pursuit of peace and prosperity.
Mr. President, our bilateral relations and friendship have been growing over the years, as we talked yesterday about the consolidation of our cooperation in all fields. I am glad to state that our relations have never been better and that our cooperation is proceeding steadily and very smoothly. We value your cooperation, especially at a time when we are exerting great efforts in order to achieve both economic reform and growth. Our cooperation in various economic fields is essential for achieving our goal of improving our economic performances and enhancing productivity.
In our discussions yesterday, Mr. President, as in our previous meetings in Washington, Cairo, and elsewhere, I have sensed the depth of your sentiments towards the friendship that binds our two countries. We in Egypt share those feelings. We are both nations that attach a great value to friendship and loyalty to our friends. Together, we have an opportunity to make the Middle East a much safer and more stable place, to the benefit of all its people and that of the entire world.
Let me, Mr. President, extend my invitation to you and to Mrs. Bush to visit Egypt when you find it convenient and at a suitable time for you, Mr. President and Mrs. Bush. We share with you a great vision of the future for a better and safer world which is within our grasp. We count on your partnership and on your leadership to sail together to that bright destination.
In conclusion, permit me to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to raise in tribute to President and Mrs. Bush, who are leading this great nation in a new era of hope and dynamism, in tribute to all friends present here, and in tribute to each American on this land, and in tribute for the good friendship between the United States of America and Egypt.

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Prime Minister, and members of the Polish delegation, thank you for your hospitality tonight and throughout our stay. We are very pleased and honored to be here.
The American people have a special and enduring interest in Poland. And in recent months, we have watched remarkable events unfold here. And so, this is not an ordinary visit, for in Poland these are not ordinary times. When I was last here, almost 2 years ago, our relations had just emerged from a long, chilly period. But we have made great progress and covered many issues: cultural, commercial, consular, scientific, communications, human rights, and others.
Mr. Chairman, the rewards for successful effort are, as always, more and greater challenges. Poland is entering a new era; it is beginning once again to command its own destiny. Polish energy and creativity are being tapped, and great steps have been taken already -- the remarkable roundtable accords, Solidarity's legalization, the holding of fair elections, the restoration of a freely elected Polish Senate. And more steps await on the road ahead. Poland has surpassed all expectations, and we respect you for that.
Reform is a difficult process, as you well know. And there are neither easy answers nor cost-free solutions, but there is a sound basis for hope. And today you have the good will of an expectant and hopeful world. We see hope not only for a new beginning in Poland but for the beginning of Europe's reconciliation -- for making Europe whole and free and at peace with itself. We want Poland to succeed in this historic effort, and we have outlined ways in which the United States can help Poland help itself. Both our governments have a great deal of work to do.
Our hearts, as always, will be filled with the abiding commitment the American people feel for this land and for her people. You know, over the past 2 years, we have celebrated the 200th anniversary of the United States Constitution, and yet not every American knows that a short time later the world's second written constitution was adopted by the Polish Parliament. And today I believe the spirit that produced the 3d May Constitution lives in Warsaw, in Krakow, and in Gdansk. And my wish for you is that 2 years from now, on the bicentennial of your Constitution, the Polish people will have achieved the kind of political transformation so long awaited, so long deferred.
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Prime Minister, let us lift our glasses to the progress we have made in relations and to our determination to proceed toward the better days and great achievements still to come. And may I say in closing to you and Mrs. Jaruzelski, our heartfelt thanks for your superb hospitality and the warmth of your welcome to me, to Barbara, and to all that are traveling with me.
Thank you. Long live Poland! To your health, sir.
"
state-dinners,George W. Bush,"July 17, 2002","
Thank you all. Mr. President and Madam First Lady, it's a great privilege for Laura and I to host you here in the White House. Tonight's dinner is a small way of saying dziekuja for the warm hospitality you showed us last year in Warsaw.
Today, Poland and the United States are meeting the challenges of our times, sustained by bonds of kinship, culture, and commerce that unite our peoples. Two centuries ago, Poles fought for America's independence. Before and since, thousands of American communities have been enriched by the energies of millions of Poles who came here to settle.
Mr. President, tomorrow we'll travel to Michigan to visit one of those communities. But pride requires me to point out that the oldest permanent Polish settlement in America can be found in my home State. In the fall of 1854, more than 100 Polish families traveled to the prairies of south Texas, seeking greater freedom and opportunity. They arrived at their destination on Christmas Eve, and they christened their new settlement Panna Maria, or Virgin Mary. The town is still there, a living symbol of our common ties.
Just as Poles keep contributing to America's vitality, Poland keeps contributing to the vitality of the entire world. Poland's opposition to Soviet tyranny inspired half a continent and helped bring down an evil empire. And the passion for human dignity and iron integrity of a Polish Pope has added to the momentum of freedom around the globe. Freedom did not have to be imported into Poland. It is found naturally in the rhythm of every Polish heart, a commitment of conscience and faith stronger than the brutality of conquerors or the official lies of oppressors.
In 1989, Poles on all sides of the ideological divide made an historic decision to build a society based on democracy and human rights and the rule of law. Two years later, more than 100 political parties participated in Poland's parliamentary elections, including one party called the Beer Lovers' Party. We're watching to see how much beer you drink tonight, Mr. President. [Laughter] All but a handful of these parties were committed to a Poland founded on freedom.
In the decades since, Poland has continued to be an example for other nations seeking to claim their democratic future. And Poland has found what America has found, that democracy and free markets are honorable and just and indispensable to national progress.
America and Poland are joined by a commitment to helping each other along freedom's road. Thomas Jefferson once wrote to Kosciuszko and praised him for being true to a single object, the freedom and happiness of man. Today, this single object defines Poland itself, and it defines the partnership between Poland and America. Together we can and we will complete the unification of Europe. We will reach out to Russia and Ukraine, and we will win the war against terror.
Poland and America share a vision that is stronger than intolerance and hatred and bigotry. It is a vision of a world that is free and just, a world that respects people's dignity and rewards their enterprise and creativity.
Mr. President, let us toast to friendship between our countries. Tonight the old Polish saying has new meaning in a new century: For your freedom and ours.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"May 30, 1972","
Your Imperial Majesty and all of your distinguished guests:
Let me first thank you on behalf of Mrs. Nixon and all the members of our party for the very generous remarks that you have made and for the magnificent hospitality which you have extended to us on this occasion, and in speaking of that hospitality, may we particularly thank you for the welcome that we received as we came into the capital city of your country today. It will leave a memory in our hearts that will last for all of our lives, and we are most grateful for the welcome we received from the people of Iran on this historic occasion.
Since ancient times, this country has been one that has been known for its splendid hospitality, and we, of course, tonight have had a good chance to see why that reputation has become worldwide.
It is always a very great privilege to visit here, but I feel especially privileged to be here in this period in which you are celebrating what you have referred to, the 2,500th year of your country's history. I think of the fact that the United States of America in just 4 years will be celebrating its 200th anniversary, and then I compare that 200 years with 25 centuries of history, and I realize that as we compare our two countries, we owe so much to you. As you have spoken so generously of what you may owe to us, we owe so much to you, not only for 2,500 years, but for a history that goes back even 6,000 years.
In this room, and in this company, speaking from what was once known and perhaps still is known as the New World, it is only appropriate that we pay our respects to and express our thanks to the magnificent heritage of the Old World that is now, through your efforts, a bridge to the new.
On this particular occasion, as all of you know, this is the first stop that we have made since the trip that we have taken to the Soviet Union. Your Majesty has referred to that trip, and I think it is only appropriate on this occasion for me to speak of that trip, the visit we had there, what it means to the world, and what it means to all nations in the world.
Before doing so, I wish to say that I have had the opportunity during the period that I have served in office--8 years as Vice President, when Mrs. Nixon and I first had the opportunity of visiting Tehran, and then over 3 years as President of the United States--and even some years out of office, the opportunity of visiting over 70 nations. I have met the heads of state and the heads of government of most of those nations, and I think that all of this company should know that in evaluating those that I have met, heads of state and heads of government, His Imperial Majesty is one who has an understanding not only of the bilateral problems that our two countries sometimes have--fortunately relatively small ones-but beyond that, an understanding of the area in which he lives and of the international problems.
His advice and counsel have been invaluable through the years, and it was for that reason that, after my visit to the Soviet Union, I was glad that the opportunity was provided, through Your Majesty's invitation, to come here, to consult with you, and to get the benefit of your wisdom in terms of the future policies of the United States of America.
Speaking now of what these visits mean, and what the future is, I think it is important for us to bear in mind that while we have been at what is called the summit, that there has been no intention on the part of the two governments represented at that summit conference--no intention to divide the world into two spheres of influence, no intention to set up a condominium. Certainly on our part--and I express here the policy of the United States in the past and the present, and I know what will be the policy in the future--we consider it important and vital that as a great nation and a powerful nation, that we seek good relations with all nations in the world.
But we also recognize that as we begin a dialogue with some nations with which we have had no dialogue at all-I refer to the visit that we paid earlier this year to the People's Republic of China--and when we begin conversations that can, and we trust will, develop a better relationship with a nation that from time to time since the great World War II has been an adversary on occasion--that as we do both of these things, we have not overlooked a very fundamental fact of international life, and that is that it is vital that we build our policy on the alliances and the friendships that we have had in the past, that we have now, and that we hope to have in the future.
That is one of the things that this visit symbolizes. We are proud that Iran is a friend of the United States, that the United States is a friend of Iran.
We are proud of the fact that we have some bonds between us--bonds that have been formalized by treaty. But I would point out to this audience, those who are here, that bonds that are formalized by treaty can be one thing; what is more important are those bonds that are further underscored by a personal relationship, a personal respect, a personal esteem, between the leaders of the countries involved.
I value the friendship that it has been my privilege to have with His Majesty over these years. I believe that all American Presidents have valued the friendship that they have had on their part with the leaders of this country.
What I am saying, very simply, is this: We are proud to have the official relationships with the Government of Iran, which have been set down on pieces of paper sometimes called treaties, sometimes called agreements. But what is more important is that we are proud of the fact that the relationship goes beyond simply the piece of paper, that it goes to the personal relationship which we see exemplified in this magnificent dinner tonight and which we trust will always be the hallmark of the relations between our two countries.
I should like to bring my remarks to a conclusion tonight by informally referring to an impression I had as we came into the city today. It was a glorious day, as all of you will remember. The sky was blue, we could see the mountains in the distance, the weather was just right, as if it had been ordered for the occasion. And then, as the motorcade moved from the airport out through the suburbs and then finally into the city, we saw the people on the streets. We could tell from the expressions on their faces they had not been ordered to come because, while you can order people to get out on the streets, you cannot order them to smile. You cannot order them to wave, and particularly, you cannot do that with the children. It must come from their hearts, and it had come from their hearts.
We saw them there, not hundreds, not thousands, but tens of thousands of girls and boys, smiling, waving, with their American flags and the Iranian flags side by side.
I am sure that through His Majesty's mind ran the same thoughts that ran through mine: Our obligation is to them; our obligation is to their future.
What we have done in the meetings that we have had in this past week is only a beginning. It possibly builds a foundation for a better future between two great nations and a foundation, possibly, for a better chance for peace for all nations in the world.
Our meetings here helped to build that foundation, a foundation of good relations that already exists between our two great countries, but a foundation for more progress in the future--progress which will benefit not just our generation, but that generation, one that will make us, as the leaders of our countries, proud of that leadership, proud of our people, proud of our heritage--yours 2,500 years old, ours so much younger.
But proud as we are of that heritage and proud as we are of that country, recognizing that our responsibility is to keep what is best from the past but also to build for the future.
As I look at Your Majesty's record, what you have done for this country in terms of the progressive actions in everything from land reform to education, so many other areas, I realize that your thoughts are, of course, about the proud past of this great nation and this great people.
But overriding that are your hopes for the future--the future of those children we saw on the streets of Tehran today.
So tonight I would simply conclude my remarks by saying that there will be many in the days ahead who will try to evaluate the so-called summits--the one in Peking in which the most populous nation of the world and the most prosperous nation of the world met for the first time in 20 years, the one in Moscow where the two most powerful nations in the world met and made some very important agreements which could contribute not only to better relations between those two but to peace for all the world.
As the experts evaluate those summits, let them keep the one thought in mind that I think is so close to the heart of His Majesty and so close to my heart: We as leaders of our countries do our best. We sometimes make mistakes, but our thoughts, our hopes, our dreams are for our children--not just our family's children but for the children of our countries, the children of all the world, that they may have the opportunity to grow up in a more peaceful world, a more prosperous world, a more friendly world. And if, in the brief span of time that each of us spends in the office he holds, we could have contributed to that goal, all of the efforts, all of the time, everything that we have done would have been worth it.
It is in that spirit that I would like to propose tonight that our glasses be raised, of course, to the continued friendship of the two great peoples--the Iranian people and the American people--whose friendship goes back so far, as His Majesty has pointed out, and also to the leadership which His Majesty has provided for his country and, of course, to his partner in that leadership, his Empress.
I would close, if I could, on one informal note. In 1953, right after General Eisenhower, who was a great friend of Iran and who was the last American President to be honored at a state dinner like this in Iran, right after he had become President he was talking to me in his office--and he often used to say that he didn't know much about politics. That, of course, is the understatement of the century for one who won such great political victories. That day we had had a meeting with the leaders of the Congress, Democrats and Republicans, and General Eisenhower, who was a great judge of men and of women in a leadership capacity, made this rather interesting comment:
He said, ""I am puzzled about political leaders. You can't generalize about them."" He said, ""Some of those fellows in there are very intelligent, and others seem to be a little slow. Some spoke very, very well, and others were a bit inarticulate."" He said, ""About the only thing that I can think of that political leaders seem to have in common, successful political leaders, is the ability to marry above themselves.""
What I am simply saying tonight is that on this particular occasion we propose a toast, of course, to His Imperial Majesty the Shahanshah, to his lovely Empress, who has been by his side, as my wife has been by my side, through adversity and also through periods of very great satisfaction.
So, ladies and gentlemen, if you would rise and raise your glasses.

Mr. President, Mrs. Suharto, distinguished hosts:
Our two great nations enjoy a growing bond of friendship while reflecting differences that enrich humanity. We are on opposite sides of the world with great contrasts in history, geography, and culture. But Indonesia and the United States also have very, very much in common.
We share a dedication to peace in Asia and in the world. We share a commitment to economic and social progress. We share the realization that international cooperation is essential for international stability and prosperity.
In recent years, we have seen many dramatic changes in the world transforming the international and political and economic affairs. But the last vestiges of' colonial empires have disappeared. The cold war division of the world has broken down. We now live in a world of some 150 independent nations. It is a smaller world in which the destinies of nations are more clearly interdependent.
In this complex time of change, America, as always, looks to its relationships with friends. Indonesia is such a friend. Indonesia exemplifies strength and self-reliance, as well as international leadership and responsibility. We respect your nonalignment and your goal of national resiliency. We admire your contribution to regional peace. We value very deeply your friendship.
Indonesia is one of the proud nations of Southeast Asia that are preserving independence. This is being done by meeting the aspirations of the people, seeking to reconcile differences, and building regional cooperation.
Just a few months ago, as you mentioned, Mr. President, we had a productive series of talks at Camp David.1 Tonight, I am delighted to be in your country. The United States, as you know, regards itself as a Pacific nation. No area of the world is more important to us than Asia.
We remain firmly committed to peace and security in Southeast Asia and throughout Asia. We see our own prosperity and progress linked with vast populations, the dynamic economies, the abundant resources, and the rich cultures of this great region of the world.
I have come here, Mr. President, because of America's continuing interest in your country's security and well-being. I am delighted our two nations have developed a genuine and growing friendship based upon mutual respect and cooperation on many, many international issues.
Our relationship involves a common concern for the right of every nation to pursue its destiny on its own independent and sovereign course. And our ties go beyond security, embracing the challenges of economic and social development, the energy problem, and a whole new spectrum of interests and issues which require a continuing dialog between developed and developing nations.
The spirit of partnership and friendship achieved by our two countries is example to others. The importance of our relationship increases with every passing year. This is our view, Mr. President. I know from our previous conversations that it is also yours.
On behalf of Mrs. Ford and myself and all of our delegation, I raise my glass and propose a toast: to you and your gracious wife, to the people of Indonesia, to our friendship, and to our common goals.

President Jiang, Madame Wang, members of the Chinese Government, fellow guests; I am honored to be here representing the people of the United States in the Great Hall of the People, which reflects the impressive progress of the Chinese people in the 20th century.
We Americans first saw it on our televisions 26 years ago when President Nixon became the first American leader to visit China. Those were the very first live pictures of China ever seen in my country. Across the United States, Americans were filled with great hope as relations resumed between our two great nations.
That visit changed history. It reminded us of the warmth each nation felt for the other, long before the cold war. It recalled our alliance in World War II and our long history of commercial relations dating back to the infancy of the United States. We were trading together before our Constitution was written. Even the tea that our Founding Fathers threw into the Boston Harbor in 1773 to protest British taxes was from China.
For most of our history we have looked upon China as a distant friend across the sea. As the Bamboo Curtain opened, Americans and Chinese learned about each other all over again. Starting with pandas and ping-pong players, we have built a broad and friendly relationship.
Today China and the United States cooperate across a wide range of enterprises, in business, in the arts, in the academic world, and in the personal friendship that unites Chinese and Americans. More than 1 million Americans trace their roots to China. Every day, Chinese-Americans build a better America, as entrepreneurs and architects, artists and public servants. And we form lifelong bonds with the thousands of Chinese students who study with us every year, teaching us their culture as they learn from ours.
Americans are proud that many of China's leaders spent time in the United States. Dr. Sun Yat-sen visited six times between 1896 and 1911, and he was in Denver when he learned he would become China's new leader. The great teacher Hu Shih was a student in New York when he pioneered a new system of expressing vernacular Chinese, an idea that changed China forever. I look forward to seeing Beijing University during its centennial year, a monument to Hu Shih and so many other friends of America.
As two great nations, the world looks to us to set a good example. In the last few months, we have seen how much we can and must do together, in our strong response to the crisis in India and Pakistan, our efforts for lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, our cooperation to stem the flow of dangerous weapons around the world. In so many different ways, we are upholding the teachings of Mencius, who said, ""A good citizen in one community will befriend the other citizens of the community; a good citizen of the world will befriend the other citizens of the world.""
Mr. President, the American people admire the great strides China has taken. Your people are leading lives inconceivable just a generation ago. Your phenomenal growth over 20 years has opened new worlds of possibility, for jobs, for more schools, for greater mobility, for instant access to the outside world. We Americans appreciate the mutual respect of our relationship, a relationship based on cooperation, candor, and recognition of each nation's values and traditions.
An ancient Chinese proverb tells us, ""Be not afraid of growing slowly; be only afraid of standing still."" Let us commit to keep moving forward together, turning small steps into giant strides for our people, our nations, and the world.
I ask you now to please join me in a toast to the President and the First Lady of the People's Republic of China and to the friendship joining our two peoples and the future we will build together. Gan bei.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"September 16, 1998","
The President. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, President Havel, Mrs. Havlova, friends from the Czech Republic, my fellow Americans. Welcome to the White House, Mr. President.
As a playwright, you could hardly have written a more dramatic scenario than the one you have in fact lived over the last 10 years. Your Presidency has reminded people around the world that words do matter, that creativity has a place in politics, that a nation's strength is measured not by its ability to control people but rather by the opposite: its success in moving and empowering them.
As you showed us in the press conference today, you have never lost the honesty, spontaneity, the contagious friendliness of your writing. I feel quite certain no other head of state would have appointed Frank Zappa as a cultural ambassador—[laughter]—or taken our favorite Czech-American, Madeleine Albright, out on the town in New York to hear some good music; or given the President of the United States a personally inscribed tenor saxophone and forced him to play it. [Laughter]
Since you became President, you have brought back democracy and civil society. You have led the Czech Republic to a place of prominence in the new Europe, and we look forward to your becoming a member of NATO.
Together we have been partners in Bosnia and in other Balkan trouble spots, working to repair the ravages of intolerance and injustice. And together we will be partners to build a peaceful, prosperous, and free Europe in the 21st century.
We value our ties to the Czech people. The first Czechs arrived in the New World in the 17th century, and many more came in the wake of the revolution of 1848. Dvorak composed his magnificent, ""New World Symphony,"" borrowing the rhythms he heard during his travels across the United States, especially from African-American folk music. The flag of the Czech Republic was designed and first flown in New York to honor a visit by the great patriot Tomas Masaryk. From athletes to artists, from actors to astronauts, from secretaries to Secretaries of State, Czech-Americans, many of whom are here tonight, have lent their gifts to our grateful Nation.
We shared the world's sadness when Czechoslovakia lost its freedom 50 years ago. We felt a similar sense of loss when the Prague Spring was followed by Soviet invasion in 1968. But you and your comrades, Mr. President, taught us again that all seasons are cyclical, that spring always returns. In 1989, your Velvet Revolution rejuvenated the entire world.
There is an old Czech-American saying that too much wisdom does not produce courage. That's a nice way of saying, I think, that too much time spent in books may keep people too much away from the active world. Mr. President, you have lived a life of the mind and a life of action. You have shown us wisdom and courage. You have made us believe that we can not only dream our dreams but redeem them.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me in a toast to the President of the Czech Republic, Mrs. Havlova, and to the people of the Czech Republic.
[At this point, President Havel made brief remarks, offered a toast, and then presented President Clinton with the Order of the White Lion.]
The President. If I put all this on—[laughter]—I may feel like royalty.
Mr. President, I first saw Prague in the second week of January in 1970. I was a young student of no visible means and fairly poor prospects. I remember that I went to Prague with a pair of rawhide boots and a Navy pea jacket I bought in the Army-Navy surplus store. But I learned something there that is as vivid to me today as it was then.
When all of you were at a moment of despair, I saw in the young students I met there a love for freedom that you gave life to again. And whenever I look at this award, I will know that it's too grand for me to wear, but I will be very glad that we could do something in the United States, through NATO, to help ensure that that freedom will never, ever be lost again.
Thank you, sir.

President Yeltsin and members of the Russian Government, friends, all, Americans and Russians, we are here for an historic occasion. I believe that this is a moment that history will record most positively as we sign that treaty. As I prepare to leave the Presidency, I bid farewell to a man for whom I have enormous respect, a man whose courage captured the imagination of every single American as he stood on a Russian tank and straddled Russian history, steering it toward a democratic future. His voice spoke loudly for freedom through the chaos of change, and it spoke softly of friendship through the static of a long distance telephone line, a patriot who silenced the guns of August, President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr. President, as you so eloquently stated, there is now a new U.S.-Russian partnership built together, affirming our dedication to a democratic peace in Europe and, indeed, to a global peace. The two powers that once divided the world have now come together to make it a better and safer place. Mr. President, we've come together again this weekend amid a Moscow winter to sign the most significant arms reduction treaty ever.
All of us, sir, wish you and your colleagues well on the bold reforms that you've undertaken. Reform is never easy, and this we understand. But your people do not run away from a challenge. And in this challenge, America will stay with you, shoulder to shoulder.
May I simply say a word about my successor, President-elect Clinton. I am confident that what we do tomorrow is of tremendous importance to him, and I am confident that you will find him a 100-percent partner in working for this U.S.-Russian relationship that we treasure so much.
I salute everybody in this room and elsewhere who had a hand in completing this historic treaty. I raise my glass to toast a strong future between Russia and the United States, to toast President and Mrs. Yeltsin, dear friends, and to toast this new year, a new year of hope, freedom, and peace for the Russian people.
Good luck and may God bless you all.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"March 22, 1984","
President Reagan. Mr. President, Madame Mitterrand, Mr. Foreign Minister, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen:
Our evening together has rekindled some pleasant memories of warm June nights in the beautiful gardens of Versailles, of observing the colorful and moving commemoration of the union of French and American forces at Yorktown, of the many distinguished world leaders at Williamsburg just last year. Soon, I look forward to bringing home yet another memory in which President Mitterrand will be a major part.
We will meet later this year to commemorate the anniversary of the landing of Allied Forces on the Normandy beaches 40 years ago. That event tied the hearts of our people, and for all time sent a message to tyrants that free men are all citizens of the same land.
Mr. President, your visit to America this week is yet another milestone in the common heritage and close association of our two freedom-loving nations. France was America's first ally. The trust and confidence which have characterized our long relationship is undoubtedly an object of great envy throughout the world. France and America share many traditions. We have innumerable ties, cherished by our people, nurtured by our governments.
Foremost among our ties is a profound commitment to democracy and liberty, a heritage inscribed in the Constitution of both our countries. These values lie at the heart of the Atlantic alliance. And this commitment between the great democracies of Europe and North America has preserved peace for a longer period than any [other] in modern European history.
Tonight I would like to reemphasize that the United States remains thoroughly committed to the Western alliance and to the defense of Europe. We seek peace and security, and to that end, .America also strives to achieve greater East-West dialog. We will continue to work for a more stable relationship with the Soviet Union—one that will lead to better understanding and a relaxing of existing tensions.
This evening, while savoring the memories of Lafayette and Rochambeau, of Jefferson and Franklin, we must also salute those contemporary figures who personify the richness of the bonds between us. I'm struck by how many of our guests here tonight share close ties to France and to French culture. Both our nations can be proud of our citizens whose work and creativity have contributed so much to the quality of our lives and who are recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.
We share strong links of culture and commerce. We engage in extensive scientific cooperation. And every day, we reap the harvest of social, cultural, and educational interchanges.
I'm particularly pleased that France and the United States are engaging in two new endeavors—an artists exchange program and a cooperation in environmental affairs. These agreements will greatly contribute to the cultural and scientific enrichment of our societies.
Mr. President, today we had a frank discussion of bilateral issues and also of those concerns of the European Community as a whole. And such dialog between us can only serve the interests of both our countries. In the years ahead, Americans and Frenchmen will be as they always have been—proud and independent, but united together in the cause of freedom, security, and economic progress. All Americans are grateful for your friendship and appreciate the courageous stands France has taken throughout the world in the cause of liberty.
When you return to your country, please take that message of our gratitude and admiration with you. In the meantime, we wish you a pleasant and worthwhile visit to the United States.
So, let us raise now a glass to the common purpose and the special friendship of France and the United States, and of President Francois Mitterrand and his lovely wife, Danielle, our guests and our friends.
President Mitterrand. Mr. President, Madame, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends:
The President of the United States has just used two words. He said that our meetings were pleasant and fruitful, and I think that no better words could be chosen.
Pleasant, our meetings have been, since this morning when we first got together from the very first moment. Thanks to yourself, Mr. President, and your wife, and all those who have contributed to make our visit so pleasant, we have enjoyed the warmest possible hospitality. And I'm speaking on behalf of myself and Mrs. Mitterrand and those accompanying me. At the same time, we have been able to engage in serious conversation, but in a climate of friendship. And you have been, I think, particularly, if I may say so, nice to France, and this is particularly due to you, Mr. President, and to you, Madame. You're responsible for this—for the warmth of our reception-and I want to thank you.
Now, I hope also that our meetings will prove to be fruitful. We have, in fact, already started discussing a number of aspects of the life of this world we live in, and sometimes those aspects are somewhat tragic and, at any rate, dramatic. We have talked about war. We have tried to find ways of overcoming and preventing war and how it can be possible, perhaps, to develop the machinery to ensure that thing that is so difficult to achieve and is so mysterious, perhaps—peace.
We have, perhaps, not yet found the secret of the key to peace, but we are craftsmen working on the job, and we are looking and we are seeking for the secret and for the key. And I think our work will prove to be fruitful because, in any case, it is always fruitful and useful to compare the assessments of the world situation of two countries who are united by friendship, and such friendship that has existed for so long, for so many years, that it becomes just a natural way of life. And I think that that is the right way to talk together and, indeed, to do good work together.
Now we have reached the end of the day and not the least pleasant moment of this very pleasant day. We have reached a moment of rest and a pleasant moment of relaxation; at the same time, a rich and useful conversation which, at the same time, carries with it the great pleasure, the warmth of just being together and, for a moment, forgetting perhaps the requirements of our official ties and existence.
And yet the paradox is that this is still a state visit, as the diplomats call it, because President Reagan has invited the President of the French Republic. But all the same, tonight for a few hours we have perhaps been able to shed the mantle—the somewhat heavy mantle of protocol and official ties and relations which we will, of course, resume very seriously tomorrow. But for the moment, we have a few hours just to live our life, and to live our life in a pleasant environment and, also, in a few moments, in an artistic environment.
Now, I will not recall here all the moments of our common history that, of course, come to mind—the people, the events that have led our two nations throughout the years and centuries of history to the situation that we are in today in this world of turmoil, where the United States and France have managed to stay linked together, closely tied and united, and for the important things have always been able to work together for peace and for the defense of a few simple principles that do not need complex explanations, but which are merely the very essence of our civilization.
And so I wish to thank you, Mr. President, and you, Madame, for the exceptional warmth and quality of the way you have received us here today and particularly tonight, and I want to thank you on behalf of my country, on behalf of France. Life—everyday life is not always particularly easy. Washington and Paris—well, there is some distance between them, naturally. And we do not always—our eyes are not always turned in exactly the same direction. And that, in a way, is perfectly natural, in view of the fact that we aren't sitting in the same place. But when it is necessary, you are present and we are present. And we know that. You know it, and we know it. And that, I think, is the best assurance that when we are gone, our successors will be able to say that that friendship which was struck up at the end of the 18th century stood well the test of time until the end of the 20th century, and then, as far as the future is concerned, well, that will be their problem.
But I think that I would like to close, Mr. President, by raising my glass. And I would like to drink to your health, Mr. President. You are responsible for a great country whose tremendous diversity reflects so much charm and strength. And to you, Madame, to your own health, to the health of your family. And to you, ladies and gentlemen, I want to drink to your health and to your life, your work, and your hopes. In other words, your life-to coin a phrase. And I hope that your life will be a long and prosperous one. In other words, what I'm saying is that I'm raising my glass to the American people so admirably represented here tonight.
Thank you.

President Yeltsin, President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Major, Chancellor Kohl, Mr. Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen:
Tonight we gather to recall one victory and the countless millions of sacrifices that produced it. It is fitting for all of us that we recall that day here in Russia, where virtually every family had a loss to mourn and a hero to remember.
A crowded 50 years separates us today from that moment. Yet it is still near in so many ways, woven with the entire war into the living memory of our civilization. Each of us has been touched by that war, even those who were born after its end.
World War II left us lessons, not for an evening but for a lifetime. We would be remiss not to mention two of them tonight. The first is the extraordinary power of men and women who joined together to fight for a just cause. The heroism of those who confronted and defeated tyranny, the alliance of Soviets, British, French, Chinese, Canadians, Yugoslavs, Poles, Americans, and so many more will forever remind people of the strength that is found in common purpose.
It inspires us here today. One-time opponents are now valued and trusting friends. And with Russia's turn to democracy, the alliance for freedom stands on the verge of great new possibility. Together we can face vistas of promise which separately we could never even imagine. And together we can face the challenges to our humanity in this age: terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the continued lust for killing based on ethnic, religious, or tribal differences.
As we look to new horizons in the new century, let us remember also another lesson of the Great War, the resilience of hope. Our nations prevailed because they never lost hope. It is the touchstone of our humanity.
Let us renew that hope tonight. And let us remember the words of Olga Berggolts, the poet of the awful siege of Leningrad. She said, ""Again from the black dust, from the place of death and ashes, will arise the garden as before. So it will be. I firmly believe in miracles."" The resolve of her city, the perseverance of its people in the face of unspeakable horror, gave her that belief in miracles. Fortified by the wonders we have seen in just the last 6 years, that belief surely lives on with us today.
And so, ladies and gentlemen, I propose a toast tonight to the heroism of 50 years ago; to the honor of the Russian people and the other Soviet peoples in the awful losses they suffered and what they gave to us; and most of all, to the hope that will carry us onward to miraculous new days ahead.
Thank you very much.

Ladies and gentlemen, Your Majesty, members of the Moroccan delegation, welcome all of you to the White House this evening. No foreign guest is more deserving of a warm welcome here than King Mohamed.
Your Majesty, as I said this morning, it is well known that when the 13 separate States of America declared themselves the United States, your ancestor, Sultan Sidi Mohamed, was the very first sovereign to recognize our new Nation.
The greatest heroes of our early history were the strongest proponents of friendship with Morocco. The treaty of friendship between our Nations was urged on Congress by Benjamin Franklin, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, signed by John Adams, and affirmed by George Washington in a letter to the Sultan. Our treaty of friendship is the oldest American treaty of its kind still enforced today.
In the two centuries since it was first signed, we have seen much to admire and be grateful for in our friendship. As the Arab nation which lies closest to the West, you have been a bridge across cultures. You have a proud tradition of independence, known the world over for your generosity and hospitality. The oldest property owned by America on foreign soil is one of the most beautiful buildings in Tangier, a gift to our country from yours.
Your Majesty, Hillary and Chelsea have visited your country three times now. They have been charmed again and again by the special character of Morocco, the warmth and hospitality of your people, the beauty of the mountains and the Madinahs, and especially your generosity of spirit.
For centuries, your land has been a model of religious tolerance. When she was there, Hillary asked people throughout your country, ""Where did you learn this tolerance?"" And over and over again they said, ""We learned it from our parents."" In Morocco, Your Majesty, that appears to be especially true of kings.
During World War II, your wise and courageous grandfather blocked efforts of the Vichy government to identify and label Moroccan Jews. Decades later, your father bravely opened a dialog with Israel, paved the way for the Camp David accords, and proved it is possible to be commander of the faithful and a bridge between faiths.
I was honored and humbled to represent the United States in Rabat last year to show our respect and affection for your father. I will never forget setting forth on foot from the Royal Palace to the mausoleum and seeing hundreds of thousands, indeed, millions of mourners on rooftops and treetops and along the side streets, surging toward the cortege, expressing their deep devotion to him.
I am pleased to tell you tonight that we are establishing, in honor of your father, the King Hassan II Memorial Scholarship Program to enable students from Morocco to study here in America and to study subjects close to the King's heart, international affairs and conflict resolution.
The people of Morocco also have immense devotion to you, Your Majesty. You have emphasized the need to improve schools for children and create jobs for their parents. You have moved to heal old wounds, promote political freedoms, protect human rights, and reach out to your people.
You have shown the courage and vision to elevate Morocco as a model of openness, prosperity, and inclusion. This is vital, not only for Morocco but also for people far beyond your borders. Friends of peace and tolerance are needed now, perhaps more than ever, as we approach the moment of truth in the Middle East peace process.
Your Majesty, America is eager to continue and to deepen our two-century-old friendship. We are eager to work with you toward a world of greater hope and understanding across cultures and continents. In that spirit, we welcome you again to the land shown such favor by your forefathers.
Welcome to America. Thank you for your friendship, and may it last forever.

President Reagan. Mr. President, Mrs. Kirchschlager, Ministers Lanc and Fischer, honored guests, I said this morning, and I would like to say again, how happy and proud that Nancy and I are to welcome you to the United States for the first state visit by an Austrian President. I consider your visit a celebration of our common bonds and our common purpose.
Before I say anything else, Mr. President, I want you to know that one of the best loved of all Austrian Americans is with us tonight, Baroness von Trapp.
The Baroness and her family fled Austria shortly before the outbreak of World War II, and their story has become known to millions in the wonderful play and film ""The Sound of Music."" Since arriving in the United States, the Baroness has come to stand for Austrian integrity, wit, and charm. And perhaps more than any other single American, she's contributed to the deep friendship that our two nations enjoy. So, Baroness, on behalf of the American people, I thank you.
Mr. President, as a neutral country between East and West, Austria has played a constructive role in international and human relations and earned the respect of all nations. During World War II, thousands of people like the von Trapps were forced to flee Austria, but today, your nation offers asylum to those who are fleeing tyranny and human suffering. Austria is a shining example of compassion and courage.
Our countries, united not by military alliance, but by shared beliefs, have a common conviction that there are basic values which transcend every system of government. Among these are the dignity of man, liberty and justice, and the cornerstone of all of our values, an unshakable belief in God. Mr. President, we have deep respect for your neutrality. We are proud to guarantee your sovereignty, and we take great comfort in the knowledge that Austria is a steadfast member of the community of Western democracies.
Given your history and geography, Austria is vitally interested in the state of East-West relations. From the beginning of my tenure in office, Mr. President, I have emphasized that in our dealings with the Soviet Union, we should be guided by realism, proceed from a position of strength, and be ready at all times to engage in efforts to reach equitable and verifiable agreements. Your country's very existence as a free and independent nation proves what patient, persistent negotiations with the Soviets can produce. We welcome the wisdom of your counsel and rest assured that we will continue this policy in the hope that it will yield the results for which the world yearns.
This morning, I spoke about creating a new tie between our peoples. In the past year, Vice President Bush's visit to Vienna, the reopening of our consulate in Salzburg, and the appointment of Helene von Damm to be our Ambassador to Austria have shown our commitment to build stronger and more vital links between our governments and our peoples. But the bonds of true friendship can never be too many or too strong. And we will create still more through your exchanges—youth exchanges, I should say, and enhanced cooperation in scientific and technological research.
Mr. President, we're grateful for your visit. The people of America look forward to hosting you and your party across our country. Your visit is a celebration of something real, tangible, and enduring: the friendship between the people of Austria and the people of the United States. At one point in ""The Sound of Music,"" the character who plays Baron von Trapp sings a song about the edelweiss, an Austrian flower. And before the song ends, the lyrics become a prayer for Austria itself. It is a prayer Americans join in—""Blossom of snow, may you bloom and grow—and bless your homeland forever.""
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please join me in a toast to the President of Austria and Mrs. Kirchschlager and to the friendship and freedom that our two peoples enjoy.
President Kirchschlager. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a great privilege, Mr. President, to be your guest today here in the White House. And believe me, it is a moving evening for all Austrians present here—a moving evening by the words, your address to us, and by the music you offered to us.
I would like to thank you most sincerely for this gracious and warm hospitality you are extending to us and for all the friendship we felt here in Washington and in the United States. I express this thanks also in the name of my wife and on behalf of the members of the Austrian Government in my company as well as in the name of the other Austrian guests today. And I am joining you to express my real pleasure that Baroness Trapp is here with us. In Austria, too, you have a wonderful reputation. You know it, I hope.
It's true—and I may repeat what I said this morning—I'm profoundly appreciative, Mr. President, that you have invited me to pay this official visit to the United States. For me and for all of Austria, this is a truly historic event. It is indeed the first official visit of an Austrian head of state to the United States since relations between Vienna and Washington were established formally 146 and informally 200 years ago.
This should not lead to wrong conclusions. The relations between our two countries have been always very good, considering the fundamentally different structures of our countries until 1918. It was on the model of your Supreme Court, for instance, as established under your Constitution, that the Austrian Empire in 1869 established its own Reichsgericht. And again, in 1919, Austria was the first country in Europe to adopt, on the example of the United States, the principle of full judicial review.
But it was during World War II, and especially in the period after the war, that the hearts of the Austrian people went out to America and the image of the United States in my country was forged by the Marshall plan, which played such a decisive part in the rebuilding of Austria and with which it has remained linked ever since. Only recently we celebrated in Vienna the 35th anniversary of the signing of the agreement on American temporary assistance to Austria and on economic cooperation, and we will never forget this event.
In those years, the trust between Austria and the United States was strengthened by 10 years of tough negotiations over the Austrian state treaty and the strong commitment of the Austrian people to democratic ideals. The conclusion of the state treaty and the recovery of Austria's full freedom in 1955 have led to a long-lasting period of excellent relations, which has continued to this day.
In the late thirties, freedom and democratic life and America's willingness to offer asylum to political and racial refugees attracted many of Austria's best sons and daughters, who have found a new home in your great country but have also helped as pioneers to build it up. Most Americans will be surprised to learn that at the middle of this century, only four countries had supplied more distinguished Americans listed in ""Who's Who in America"" than the small country of ours, Austria. It may indeed be unexpected that a land-locked country of central Europe, speaking a different language from that of America—you see it in my speaking—as small as the State of Maine and less populous than the city of New York should have been one of the major contributors to American life and culture. But to us, it is additional proof of our community of interests.
Mr. President, you exercise your high office at a time of global political tension and crisis, many of which are also of vital importance to my country. Austria, as a permanently neutral country, makes every effort to contribute towards the maintenance of world peace by promoting understanding in the geopolitical area in which history has placed us. And by trying to secure friendly relations with all our neighbors, we are trying to remain an element in Europe's stability and security, to be a haven for refugees as well as a clear voice in support of human rights.
As a small country we have a vested and, indeed, a vital interest in upholding the rule of law in world politics and the principle of universality in international organizations. In all these respects, the world can continue to count on us in the future.
Our two countries are and will remain closely linked through their mutual adherence to the fundamental values of democratic Western pluralism to which the Austrian people has dedicated itself in all elections since 1945. In my view, this is the best basis for a mutual interest in a long-lasting friendship. Our common pledge for an increased support to youth exchange programs will additionally promote mutual understanding and help to deepen our relations also in the next generation.
As an expression of this hope, and as a token of our heartfelt friendship, I would like to extend to you, Mr. President, and to Mrs. Reagan a cordial invitation to pay a visit to Austria, be it officially or unofficially, whatever is more convenient to you. [Laughter]
With repeated cordial thanks for your hospitality and with my sincere good wishes for the prosperity of the United States and the American people, I invite you all to join me in a toast to the President of the United Nations of America and Mrs. Reagan.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"June 17, 1980","
THE PRESIDENT. A lot of people have accused me of inviting Their Majesties to Washington just so we could have Queen Noor visit the White House. [Laughter] That's not entirely accurate, because there are many reasons why we should want His Majesty, King Hussein, to come back to visit with us, as well as his beautiful bride and the new mother of his new child, to come with her parents and her brothers and sisters and to be with us this evening. It's a delightful experience for us, and her presence vividly demonstrates the close relationship and the unbreakable ties between our two countries.
The first time that King Hussein came to visit a President of the United States was in 1960, when President Eisenhower lived in this home. And he's been here many times since, a great leader, one who represents accurately the courage and the dynamism and the commitment and the progress of the people of Jordan.
He has led his nation over more than a quarter of a century, in good times and in dangerous times, in successful times and in disappointing times, but always with a deep commitment to what's best for his own people and the preservation of stability and peace and the honoring of human rights not only in Jordan but throughout the Middle East.
He's indeed been an inspiration to many people who have served as the leaders of other nations. This is a troubled time in the history of the world, and to have a leader like him, still young, but with deep experience, reaching out his hand of friendship and peace to those neighbors of Jordan who look to him with confidence and with admiration, is reassuring to us all.
We share a great deal in common—a commitment to the integrity of international boundaries; a commitment to the unity of nations in the Middle East, to the preservation of peace, to the security of all, and to the enhancement of those principles which guide human beings and which never change. But, at the same time, he has exhibited to a remarkable degree an ability to ensure economic progress and utilization of modern science and technology to give his people a better life.
King Hussein is a good counselor and adviser for other leaders of nations who meet with him. And although sometimes our two nations do disagree on the technique for achieving a goal, we share completely a common commitment to the same goals—to the realization of the full rights of the Palestinian people, to the security of Israel and all the nations in the Middle East, to the honoring of deep religious feelings, and to the knowledge that people of good will ultimately, with courage and with perseverance, sometimes with patience, can triumph.
We have had good discussions so far today—much better than would have been expected—because of his frankness and because of his generosity, his eagerness to understand different points of view without yielding at all on the deep principles which have guided his life and which he holds so dear. We have expressed our concern about aggression demonstrated by the Soviets' invasion of Afghanistan. We've expressed our concern about international terrorism, exhibited in Iran with the unwarranted holding of innocent Americans hostage for many months, and we've expressed our commitment to stability in the Persian Gulf region and to peace in the Middle East.
I would like to say in closing that because of his own leadership and because of geographical circumstances of his own nation, Jordan will indeed play a central role in the realization of the hopes and dreams of all who want peace and stability and freedom and security in the Middle East.
At this time, I would like to propose a toast, if you will stand and join me. To Their Majesties, King Hussein and Queen Noor, to the friendship which binds our two nations and our two people together, and to the commitment to peace and the enhancement of human rights and a better life for all those of faith and good will everywhere throughout the world.
THE KING. Mr. President, Mrs. Carter, ladies and gentlemen, my good friends:
I'd like to thank you, sir, for your kind and warm words of friendship towards both Noor and I, towards a friendship that I value, towards the ties and relations that have grown between our two nations over many years, and through good and difficult times, the ties that we treasure, for the fact that there are links of people who uphold the same ideals and principles and are dedicated towards fulfilling the same objectives for a better tomorrow which, hopefully, will bring a preservation of dignity to human beings, peace, justice, and a better life.
It's true, sir, I have had the privilege of visiting the United States over many years. I'm a firm believer and have always been dedicated to the cause of friendship between our people, a better understanding, and I'm proud to have been able to serve this objective and will continue to do so to the end of my days.
Throughout these many years and many occasions, I've had the privilege of meeting with leaders of this great Nation. I said it today, and I've said it often: throughout all these meetings, none gave me more of his time to discuss the problems of our part of the world and indicated as much of an interest in the problems that we face in the area from which I came and the determination to contribute towards solutions to those problems as have your good selves.
It is true that we may have differences in approach, but we respect your dedication to the cause of peace in our part of the world. It's a dedication that we share. We look into the future with hope, with determination, to contribute our full share for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East which will affect not only those who live there but future generations there and elsewhere in the world.
We thank you for the opportunity to be with you, to have this opportunity to discuss our problems, to discuss all matters as friends, as brethren, and I'm convinced that this opportunity will enable us to address ourselves more adequately to the challenge in the times to come. We have been overwhelmed by the kindness and warmth with which we have been received once again, almost at home and amongst friends.
Thank you very much, sir, from both Noor, myself, and all who accompanied me from Jordan on this visit to the United States. May God bless you; may your efforts always meet with success in the times to come. Thank you, Mr. Carter.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, I call upon you to rise and join me in drinking a toast to the President and Mrs. Carter, to the United States, to friendship and fruitful cooperation in serving our mutual and common objectives. To peace and a better future.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"August 01, 1969","
Mr. President, and our friends from Pakistan and the United States:
I have the privilege of responding to the very gracious and eloquent words of the President on this occasion, and in doing so, I want to respond for all of those from the United States that are here, and for the many who are friends of Pakistan in the United States who could not be here. Mr. President, I can say that this has been a very memorable day for all of us, and particularly for me and for Mrs. Nixon; memorable from the time that we arrived at the airport, when we saw the very friendly people who welcomed us as we drove through the roads on the way here to this residence, and then the very constructive talks that we had during the afternoon, the truly magnificent presentation on the grounds where we saw not only the dances, but in addition, the splendid-I perhaps should say the best--bagpipe group that probably exists in the world.
Then tonight this dinner, one that we shall always remember because of the historic setting in which it takes place, because of the good company that is here, and because of the really superb way in which this dinner has been presented.
In that connection, if I could be permitted one personal comment, we have particularly enjoyed the music, the chance alternately to appreciate and understand the music of Pakistan and then the music of the United States. We are most grateful to the orchestra and we thank you for that.
I learned something interesting about the music, incidentally, when one number was being played. I found that it was a wedding number and I was told that wedding numbers quite often are melancholy in Pakistan because it is a sad time to have the bride leave the family and go, of course, away from home to someone else. When we had met the lovely ladies from Pakistan here tonight, we well understood why that would have been the case.
But if I may turn to what are more serious thoughts for a moment, earlier this evening in the reception, one of your guests pointed out that on this occasion our stay in Pakistan would be exactly 22 hours, which happens to coincide with the exact number of hours that the two astronauts spent on the moon.
I think there is a lesson in that, a lesson in it that I would like to expand on very briefly. This journey came about due to the fact that I wanted to be present when our astronauts came back from the moon. It was truly a very exciting experience-after having talked to them on the telephone when they were on the moon--to be there in the Pacific when they completed that successful journey.
Now, with this visit to Pakistan, we complete the Asian phase of our journey around the world. It is true that the visits have been brief, only one day in each country, except for a longer stay in Bangkok, where we had 2 days. But in that period of time, it gave us the opportunity, and particularly me the opportunity, to revisit a number of countries that I had known before, to talk to a number of leaders that I had met before and to meet some that I had not had the opportunity to talk to before, but beyond that, putting it in the perspective of that 22 hours on the moon, and the 22 hours that we are spending in Pakistan, it brings home this one thought:
Unfortunately--I say unfortunately because all around this table, I am sure, would like to participate in the high adventure of being the first to go to the moon or the first to go to Mars, provided we had an absolute, guaranteed, free ticket, whatever the case might be--but we all know that that is not possible, that none of us here will be in that experience, although we will share in it, share in it through the medium of television and radio and communication, which now brings the world together as it has never been brought together before.
On the other hand, while that was a very great adventure, and as the president very generously has pointed out, an achievement of which we are very proud, I think that what we have seen in this less than a week in Asia is also adventure of the very highest order.
I visited all of these countries 16 years ago. Many problems have developed since that time, and I know that there are still many problems today. But looking at the perspective of 16 years, I know that virtually all of the nations that I visited then have moved forward substantially from where they were. That is true of Pakistan. It is true in terms of your economic development. It is true in terms of your industrial development. Despite whatever other problems may have occurred in the meantime, keeping it in the long perspective of history, this is something we must always have in mind as a symbol of hope for the future.
But looking further down the road, in the countries we have visited and the area that we have covered, what we see are one and a half billion people in Asia. In 25 years there will be 3 billion people in Asia. And from this part of the world will either come the greatest progress, and thereby the peace that we all want in the Pacific and in the world, or the greatest destruction that the world has ever known.
I do not think I am overstating in putting it that way. So we look at these countries, we look at the hope, and we look also at the problems. We can see that all of our hopes are bound together. We have our differences, yes, between nations in the area, on this policy or that policy, but looking toward the future, it is essential, absolutely essential, that we have a generation of peace for Asia and the world.
We in the United States want to play our part in attempting to begin that generation by ending a war in which we are presently engaged on a basis that will promote that real peace that we all want, and then to work on for peaceful policies all over the world in the future.
But beyond that, and responding particularly to what the President has said, as we consider this explosion in population from 1 ½ billion to 3 billion people over 25 years, the greatest explosion that has ever occurred in the history of the world, it means that there must be an increase in agricultural production, in industrial production, and also the ability to handle this period of tremendous change in a peaceful way.
What I am really trying to say is, as great and exciting as was the accomplishment of those men landing on the moon, those of us who have the opportunity and the responsibility and the challenge of dealing with this problem also have an exciting and, it seems to me, great adventure, because what we do--what we do day by day in making the decisions that will determine whether peace and freedom and justice and progress go forward together in Asia and the world--what we do can affect the future of not just a billion and a half, not just 3 billion, but of the 4½ to 5 billion people that will live on this earth 25 years from now.
Talking in such big numbers I am sure seems to raise the whole problem beyond the ability to comprehend. But, again, we get back to the moon.
Who would have thought 25 years ago that two men from earth would stand on the moon? It was too much to comprehend. But it happened. It happened because men worked together and they planned together, and as a result, they achieved success.
And I say that that kind of planning and working, that kind of genius, it is not limited to one nation, but that comes from all peoples all over the world, that that kind of genius applied to these enormous problems and these enormous challenges that we see, particularly in Asia.
We can have a period of peace, uninterrupted peace, for a generation. And that can mean the progress that we want for this area and for all the world.
And I just want to say, finally, Mr. President, I came here, as everybody around this table knows, as one who has long been a friend of Pakistan. You were generous to state that while I was Vice President of the United States, I played some role in seeing that the friendship between our two countries remained strong and became stronger.
Now that I am President of the United States, with somewhat more influence than I had as Vice President, I can assure you that I am going to continue to work for a cause that is very close to my heart, the friendship, the friendship between two great peoples, so that we can work together in the solutions of these great problems, work together possibly not in going to the moon or to Mars, although we can participate also in those great ventures in one way or another, but in working together in the equally exciting adventure that I have described, of the future, the future of the hundreds of thousands, yes, I would say millions of children that I have seen on the streets of the cities of Asia over these past 6 days.
And, so, with that, I conclude simply by saying that I am proud to be in this room to respond to this toast in this way, in a country where I have been received so often officially in such a generous way, and when I came as a private citizen in just as hospitable a way.
Mr. President, I ask that all here stand and raise their glasses to the President of Pakistan and to the continuing and increasing friendship between the people of Pakistan and the people of the United States.

state-dinners,Gerald R. Ford,"August 03, 1975","
Mr. President, Madame Broz, ladies and gentlemen:
I am very, very delighted to be back in Yugoslavia. Twelve years is much too long to be away.
Mrs. Ford and I thank you most sincerely for the warm and wonderful welcome of your people and for your own very gracious remarks, Mr. President.
While I am deeply appreciative of the justly renowned Yugoslav hospitality shown to Mrs. Ford and to me personally, I am very mindful that this kind expression represents the friendship which the Yugoslav people feel for the American people.
I can assure you, Mr. President, that this sentiment is fully reciprocated on our part. We Americans have long valued our ties of friendship with Yugoslavia. Americans have particularly admired Yugoslavia's independent spirit. Whenever independence is threatened, people everywhere look to the example of the struggle of Yugoslavian people throughout their history. They take strength and they take inspiration from that example.
Mr. President, this spirit and your courageous leadership brought the Yugoslav people successfully through the harsh trials of World War II and its aftermath, into an era of peace, stability, and economic growth. Yugoslavia is confident of its place in the world and its prospects for the future, and I believe your confidence is fully justified.
American interest in Yugoslavia's continued independence, integrity, and well-being, expressed often in the past, remains undiminished. Tonight, I have the pleasure to reassert my nation's positive interest in the future of your nation.
Yugoslavs and Americans have both benefited from many joint efforts to speed the economic development of Yugoslavia. Our bilateral trade continues to grow. It has more than doubled in 5 years. Yugoslav-American economic councils have been established in Belgrade and New York City. Many American firms are working closely with Yugoslav enterprises, such as the construction of your country's first nuclear power facility. Our Export-Import Bank plays a very positive role in supplying loans and guarantees. Yugoslav-American scientific, technological, cultural cooperation and exchanges are an increasingly important part of our bilateral relations.
But our mutual accomplishments in dealing with economic problems must be viewed from the perspective of the interdependence of all nations.
We have been distressed by the intransigence and irresponsibility reflected in some of the discussions of vital issues in United Nations forums. The growing alienation between developing nations can only harm the best interests of both and jeopardize the solution of universal problems.
I assure you, Mr. President, that the United States will play its full role and its full part in efforts to resolve these issues in the best interests of all people.
Yugoslavia has taken a very prominent role in international affairs under your guidance, Mr. President. The United States recognizes that your country's policy of nonalignment makes an active contribution to greater understanding among peoples.
Yugoslavia and the United States have consistently worked for cooperation based on the equality of all members of the international community under the United Nations Charter in settling of outstanding international problems.
Our two countries, as in the case of all friends, have had differences, but we are able to discuss them openly, as friends do, and to resolve them. The main point is that we are never in doubt about the importance of common goals or about our deep commitment to the continuity of friendly relations.
At this time, with the aims of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe so clearly in our thoughts, let us emphasize the mutuality and the interdependence of our basic concerns for peace, security, and human progress in the years to come.
In that spirit, I ask you to join me in a toast to President Tito, whose courage, wisdom, and leadership have meant so much for Yugoslavia and the world, in which his country has played such an important part.
"
state-dinners,George Bush,"May 14, 1991","
The President. Your Majesty and Your Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to the White House, to a dinner to salute the relationship between America and Great Britain which has perhaps never been more special. We've got a lot of things in common. Americans share the Queen's love of horses. And I often wonder if I'd be standing here today if it weren't for a horse fancier named Paul Revere. [Laughter]
Most of all, what links our countries is less a place than an idea -- the idea that for nearly 400 years has been America's inheritance and England's bequest. The legacy of democracy, the rule of law, and basic human rights. Recently, this legacy helped our nations join forces to liberate Kuwait. All Americans involved in the crisis will remember as long as they live the resolve of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Prime Minister John Major, the gritty resolution, ma'am, of Your Majesty's services, and through it all, the steadfast support of the British people. We believed that the human will could outlast the bayonets and the barbed wire, and so we told the world aggression will not stand. Our military cooperation in the Gulf harkened back to our joint military endeavors of two World Wars, and four decades of peacetime alliance. And yet it forms just one part of the remarkable British-American friendship.
Your Majesty, as you so graciously put it this morning, showing ""marvelous disregard of history,"" your visit 15 years ago celebrated America's bicentennial. How proud we were to have you here. And incidentally, as in your later visits, you showed then another quality which links us: a love of exercise. Rain or shine, your long walks have left even the Secret Service agents panting away. [Laughter] And I'm glad that my fibrillating heart was not taxed by a competitive walk-off today. [Laughter]
As you remember, on the Bicentennial Bell are inscribed the words, ""Let freedom ring."" Freedom has been ringing far and wide in recent years. Look at Eastern Europe; to some degree, in the Soviet Union; certainly in South America and other parts of the world. And what that movement owes to the example of Britain and America can hardly be overstated. Nor can the role of those who persevered and the cannons of liberty and who embody the extraordinary ties of sympathy and fellow feeling between our countries.
Let me close with one such man. His name was Abraham Lincoln, whose picture is over our shoulder -- my shoulders here. Perhaps his most perceptive biography was written early in this century by an Englishman, Lord Charnwood. Upon Lincoln's death Disraeli said, ""It touches the heart of nations and appeals to the domestic sentiment of mankind.""
Your Majesty, you have touched the heart of this nation many times -- and in our bicentennial year; and then visiting our shores in 1983, the 200th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris; and then again in 1989. I know I speak for the American people when I express the belief that the bonds which connect our nation and yours -- bonds of history, principle, interest, and affection -- will endure until the end of time.
In that spirit and conscious of the real honor that is ours tonight, I ask you to rise and join me in a toast: To the liberty we share; to the liberty we seek to keep; to the ties which bind America and Great Britain, the ties which make us one; and to the health of our friend, a true liegeman of democracy, Her Majesty the Queen.
Queen Elizabeth II. Mr. President, I must first thank you for your characteristically generous words of welcome. I was delighted to be able to accept your invitation to pay this state visit to Washington and to renew my acquaintance with Blair House, now magnificently restored. Rumor has it that it was another British guest who was at least in part responsible for the decision to make Blair House into the Presidential guest house. It seems that Winston Churchill spent 3 weeks in the White House as the guest of the Roosevelts over Christmas in 1941. Churchill preferred to work at night. And the story goes that very late one night, or more likely, very early in the morning, he tried to persuade Mrs. Roosevelt to let him talk to the President. And Mrs. Roosevelt is supposed to have decided then and there that henceforth the President's guests -- [laughter] -- should be accommodated elsewhere. [Laughter] It so happens that when we came here at the invitation of President Eisenhower, Blair House was temporarily out of commission. And so we stayed in the White House. I may say that neither the President nor I attempted to disturb the rest of the other. [Laughter]
This is now the fourth time I have had the honor of proposing a toast to the President of the United States in the very place where my father once proposed a toast to President Roosevelt. No wonder I cannot feel a stranger here. The British have never felt America to be a foreign land. Here we feel comfortable and among friends. This is not entirely one-sided. It was Mrs. Roosevelt who wrote in 1939, after the long talks between my father and the President about the world crisis, that in times of danger something deeper comes to the surface, and the British and we stand together with confidence in our common heritage and ideas.
This visit and those which we are to pay to Florida and Texas is, therefore, an occasion to reaffirm what has sometimes been called the special relationship between our two nations. The path of this friendship has not always been smooth. But at a time of unusual tension between us, my great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria noted in her diary shortly before she died that the disputes and disagreements between us are really entirely superficial. I am convinced that this is still true today.
And so, Mr. President, while much has changed since those days, events still demand that our two countries use their mutual understanding to work together with our allies and partners towards a world in which more people and more nations can live in freedom with confidence in the rule of law. As you put it in your Inaugural Address, we know that freedom works. During the Gulf crisis, your country and mine have together shown that freedom works. In the ceaseless task of promoting freedom and free institutions and in standing up for them wherever they may be threatened, the United States has given courageous and unwavering leadership.
The free world has to thank you, Mr. President, for your clarity of vision and firmness of purpose. You have led not with bombast and rhetoric but with steadiness and quiet courage -- what Thoreau described as ""three-o'clock-in-the-morning courage."" And you made the decisions that had to be made.
Mr. President, I raise my glass to you and Mrs. Bush; to the friendship of our two nations; and to the health, prosperity, and happiness of all the people of the United States of America.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"March 15, 1995","
Ladies and gentlemen, Your Majesty, Your are delighted to welcome you to America's Royal Highnesses, members of the Moroccan home. I have been grateful for this opportunity delegation, distinguished guests: Hillary and I to get to know Your Majesty and to appreciate the wise counsel you have given to every American President since John Kennedy.
In fact, your relationship with our country's leaders, I have learned, goes back even further than that. In January of 1943, at the height of World War II, you were present when your father, Mohammed V, hosted the Casablanca summit between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. History does not record what advice you gave President Roosevelt and the Prime Minister, but I did note that, thereafter, the war turned decisively to the Allies' advantage. [Laughter] So, clearly, you gave good advice.
I also noted that when President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill were in Casablanca, Mr. Roosevelt thought he had to come home and go to work, and Prime Minister Churchill made him stay in Morocco for 3 more days to see the beautiful sights. My staff never lets me do that. [Laughter] So we have not made progress in every respect since the 1940's.
Your Majesty, you have written that in the joyous moment following the declaration of Morocco's independence, your father pulled you aside and said, ""We have passed through a difficult trial. But the road ahead will be long and hard. We do not have the right to disappoint the faithful and courageous people who have placed their trust in us."" For the past 34 years, you have lived by your father's admonition. And by pursuing progress for the Moroccan people and peace for all the peoples of your region, you have truly fulfilled his legacy.
The American people especially admire your steadfast devotion to securing a comprehensive peace among all the peoples of the Middle East. In a region where passion and hatred have so often overwhelmed cooler heads and clearer minds, yours has always been a voice of reason and tolerance. Quoting from the Koran, you have said, ""If two groups of believers fight each other, endeavor to reconcile them."" You have been tireless in your pursuit of reconciliation. You have helped the countries of the Middle East turn on the past and start a new chapter of peaceful coexistence.
Your Majesty, you have spoken of your beloved Morocco as a bridge between East and West, between Islam and the Judeo-Christian faiths, between respect for tradition and openness to the future. Under your leadership, that bridge, which runs from the tip of Europe to the sands of the Sahara and joins the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, that bridge has risen high as a beacon of hope.
And for all those reasons, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, please join me in raising a glass to His Majesty, King Hassan II, to the Prince and the Princess who are here, and to the people of Morocco, who have done so much to build the bridges of understanding and peace.

Mr. President, Mrs. Sadat, and all of the very distinguished guests attending this magnificent banquet here in Cairo:
Mr. President, it has been a very great honor and a privilege for Mrs. Nixon and me to travel to many countries over the past 27 years. As a matter of fact, this is the 83d nation that I have had the privilege of visiting. There have been many memorable days over those years in those countries. But I can say tonight that I can think of no day that will stay more in our memory, that will bring back such pleasant memories of those things that occurred than this historic day that we have spent with you here in Cairo. I say this for a number of reasons.
First, because of the heartwarming reception we received--and we know we received it for the American people that we represented--as we drove from the airport into Cairo. We have seen big crowds before, but as has often been said, you can get a crowd out, but you cannot make that crowd smile unless they want to smile. And we felt that we could sense the heart of Egypt on this occasion and on this day. And through their hearts they reached ours, and we believe they reached the hearts of the American people, because we in America want to be friends of this nation and its people, and that traditional Egyptian-American friendship which goes back over so many years-which has been disturbed at times over the past generation--that friendship has now been restored.
This day's events signify and symbolize that restoration, and also, this day's events, we trust, will initiate a new era in our relations in which the Egyptian people, the American people will be able to work together, dedicating their energies to solving the problems of peace and thereby developing the progress that both peoples want in both of our countries as well as in other countries in the world.
Another reason we will remember this day is, of course, this magnificent banquet tonight, and we only wish that time would permit more of an opportunity for us to talk to each and every one of the very distinguished guests who are here, those from your country, the distinguished ambassadors from most of the countries of the world, and of course, those guests from the United States you have been so kind to have.
A third reason that this day will be a memorable one for me has been the opportunity that it has provided to know for the first time through personal discussion--except for a brief telephone conversation a few months ago at Aswan--to know the President of this nation, a man who in a very short space of time has earned the respect not only of his friends and his nation's friends but those who are his adversaries--or were his adversaries-and certainly the respect of all observers in the world.
As we look at this man and what he has done, I would analyze leaders of the world that I have met in two different categories. It is, of course, sometimes rather dangerous to oversimplify, but I think it can be fairly said that sometimes a leader concentrates almost exclusively on the problems of his own country at the expense of concentration that he might well give to problems of the nations around him or of the world that might affect his country.
There are other leaders who have gained their reputations through exactly the opposite tactic; they have failed to pay as much attention as they might to the problems of their own people because of their desire to become involved in adventurous activities and policies with regard 'to their neighbors and other countries in the world.
But what marks the difference between a leader who is parochial on the one hand or who is too much concerned about the problems of other people than his own on the other, is one who recognizes that the two problems are inseparable, and so it is with this nation.
Egypt, because of its size, because of its location, because of the competence and quality and ability of its people, because of its great historical heritage, is destined to play a great role in this area of the world and in the whole world, as it has played such a role in the centuries past.
And consequently, whoever leads this people and this nation is one who should concentrate his efforts on building a better life for the people of his nation, and President Sadat has done that. He has dedicated his Presidency to accomplishing that goal, but he has also recognized that this country, for the reasons that I have mentioned, must also play a role, an activist role, a positive role on the world scene, and particularly in this area of the world which has caused so much suffering and so much potential danger over these past 30 to 40 years.
And so, the opportunity to meet with President Sadat, to discuss not only the new bilateral initiatives we are going to undertake for better relations between our own countries, initiatives that will help us both, to discuss with him also the problems of this area and to discuss with him international policies generally was, for me, a very valuable and a very constructive experience.
And so, you can see why I would say that of all the many days that it has been my privilege to spend abroad among great people in many fine capitals, this day will be remembered, certainly as much or even more than almost any day I can remember.
The President has spoken of some of the difficult problems and the complex ones that still exist in this area, and I would be less than candid if I were not to say, standing here in his presence, that I do not come, just as Dr. Kissinger did not come earlier in his conversations, with ready-made solutions for these complex problems, some of which go back over many years, some of which are going to require a great deal of dedicated diplomacy on the part of all parties concerned in order to find a just and equitable solution.
But I do say to you, Mr. President, and I do say to this company, I say to every nation represented here, because every nation in the world has a stake in the peace in the Mideast for the reasons that I mentioned this morning, I say the United States will play a positive role. We have no designs on any nation in this area. We have no desires to dominate any part of this area. Our only interest is, first, peace in the area and, second, the right of every nation and every people to achieve its own goals in its own ways by its own choosing, free of outside domination or outside interference.
To accomplish this goal will take not simply the diplomacy, brilliant though it was, that has brought us as far as we have come, the first two great steps toward reaching a permanent and just peace.
We have started down a long road, but the road stretches on and we have a long way to go. 'And I can only say that we in the United States, our Government, will dedicate its best efforts to going down that road to achieve the goals of the peoples of this area, the nations of this area, goals of peace and progress and prosperity, we would trust, in the end for all concerned.
On such an evening as this, standing in such a place as this, one cannot help but feel the sense that centuries of civilization look down upon us, and as we feel that sense of history in this place which has perhaps as much or more history behind it than any in the world, we feel the obligation that we have, each one of us here, to future generations.
This has been called, this area, the cradle of civilization, and now we have the challenge, the opportunity, the privilege of seeing that the civilization which we have inherited from the great giants of the past survives and not only survives but is passed on to future generations, stronger, more effective, certainly, we would trust, more helpful to all of the people who live in this part of the world.
I can only say that I am sure I speak for all those here, who are the guests of the President and Mrs. Sadat, that we are privileged to be here on such a memorable day. We trust that this is a day truly of a new beginning for all the nations in this area, a new and a good beginning, and one that will benefit thereby all the nations of the world. And I am sure that all of you would want to join me in the toast that I will propose, not only to the new Egyptian-American relationship, a relationship of friendship that should never have been broken in the past--and we dedicate ourselves to seeing that it will never be broken in the future--and second, to a man who has demonstrated that he is not only a great leader of his own country but that he is one of those rare leaders who also has the vision and wisdom to contribute to peace for all people in all countries as well.
And in proposing a toast to him, I would not forget Mrs. Sadat. She, like my wife, stands by her husband's side, and she is known throughout her country for her dedication to him and for her service to her country, whether it is in war or in peace.
So, ladies and gentlemen, if you would rise and raise your glasses to the President and Mrs. Sadat.
"
state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"November 14, 1978","
THE PRESIDENT. First of all, let me welcome all of you to the White House. This is a wonderful occasion for us, to have a distinguished visitor, his sister, his two sons, to come and represent a country that has extremely significant historical ties with our own Nation.
When I welcomed King Hassan this morning, I pointed out to the audience on the South Lawn that our Nation declared its independence in 1776. And in 1777 we were sitting here fighting for freedom, a small struggling country with practically no friends in the rest of the world. But one nation came forward and said, ""We recognize you as an independent people."" And I think all of you here can guess which nation that was. It was Morocco.
This, of course, was in 1777. And now for more 'than 200 years our country has been honored with the friendship and the alliance and support and partnership with a great people, the Kingdom of Morocco. Ten years later, we signed a treaty of peace and commerce and began a very fruitful trade between our two nations, with the exchange of ambassadors, first of all, and then with merchant seamen, more recently airmen, members of our Navy. This has been a very constant and fruitful interrelationship between two people.
My mother visited Morocco recently. King Hassan tells me that Morocco has recovered from her visit. [Laughter] As a matter of fact, my mother is a walking chamber of commerce for Morocco. And I thought she was the greatest supporter of Morocco that I knew, until I sat next to Mrs. Billy Casper. Her husband has played in 8 [golf] tournaments in Morocco. They visited Morocco 20 times. And she says that of all the countries she has ever visited, it's her favorite.
The history, the customs, the tradition, the achievements of Morocco are admirable in every respect. And it is a great honor for us to have King Hassan come and visit here, 11, 12 years since he made his last visit. The first time he came here with his own father as a Crown Prince, and he's brought his oldest son, the Crown Prince, with him this time.
The last time King Hassan came to our country, about 12 years ago, the Middle East was in a time of crisis, indeed war. On this occasion we are struggling to prevent a recurrence of that kind of crisis in the Middle East.
We've made historic progress in recent months. The outcome of the final negotiations for peace between Egypt and Israel is still in doubt. But one of the staunch allies and friends of President Sadat who courageously supported him when he made his historic journey to Jerusalem almost exactly 12 months ago was King Hassan of Morocco. It was not an easy thing for him to do. He was castigated and criticized by some because he expressed his friendship and support for that giant step toward peace. But this is typical of his leadership.
He's been instrumental in giving us advice and counsel. Me, as a new President, I had a lot to learn about the Arab world, about historical interrelationships, about the continent of Africa, the prospects for peace. And in many ways that have never been revealed, he's been very constructive in laying a basis for progress that is now being made.
My wife and the Crown Prince have been speaking tonight in Spanish. The Crown Prince is quite fluent; my wife is still a student. But King Hassan told me that even in years gone by, the Spanish language has been very helpful to our Nation. In 1943, as you well know, in a time of worldwide crisis, President Roosevelt met with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Churchill, in Casablanca.
It was a highly secret meeting. Intelligence revealed their presence there. The Germans were informed. Fortunately, they had a Spanish translator in Berlin, and the information that reached Hitler was that the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain were meeting in the White House. [Laughter] So, although this building was in danger of being bombed, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill escaped unscathed.
That's a true story, as a matter of fact, but a very interesting element from history shows again that in time of crisis, the great nation of Morocco was a place for the resolution of differences and the laying for groundwork for peace.
We are honored, too, because King Hassan has been so diligent and so successful in providing for his own people an expanded opportunity for living a fruitful life. Under his benevolent leadership, the people of Morocco have been granted constitutional government with the holding of elections in a very successful way, the election of a new parliament, including members of the political opposition. And this has been done in such a fine and successful fashion that Morocco has set, indeed, an example for other nations to emulate.
The tremendous natural wealth of Morocco is still in many instances waiting to be tapped. And its phosphate reserves, its oil reserves, oil shale, uranium reserves, and the great agricultural capability of his country and the human resources are now being developed in a very constructive way in partnership, on occasion, with us. Although the relationships are of mutual benefit, I would have to say in candor that we have benefited much more from our relationship with Morocco than vice versa.
It's a wonderful opportunity to have here a man who understands the continent of Africa, an area where our own interest has just recently begun to be exerted in a constructive fashion. And when the world sat in doubt and the nation of Zaire was threatened with invasion from outside forces, there was one nation, again, that showed leadership and courage. And you don't have to guess long to know that that nation was Morocco, a stabilizing influence there, instant action brought about by strong and competent leadership. And that's, indeed, the example that King Hassan has established for the world to observe.
I would like to say in closing that we are very grateful for this alliance and for the progress that has been achieved in his country, and the benefit that we have derived from it in our Nation.
It's very reassuring to me as a President to know that I can enjoy the friendship and the support, the advice and the counsel and the common purpose which has historically bound our nations together.
And on behalf of the 220 million people of the United States of America, I would like to propose a toast to the people of the Kingdom of Morocco and to their great leader, and a friend of all Americans, King Hassan II. To King Hassan.
KING HASSAN. The efforts after dinner is not good for digestion— [laughter] but I shall try to.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present you the President, Jimmy Carter, not as President of the United States, but as a new, but close and loyal friend of myself and of my country.
I never met the President before. But this morning I felt that there will be many, many strong ties between him and between I, because we are convinced that the democracy and the freedom are the best reasons for people to live, to fight, to win, or to die.
The President told you that Morocco is rich with uranium, phosphate, and perhaps oil. But before, Morocco is rich by his history, is rich by his respect for the dignity and rights of men. And it's why I feel that President Carter and I, we will build a very long and large bridge over the ocean to make our people more close and more allied, allied not against someone, but allied against poorness, against war, against the strengths of the weapons, and allied for the prosperity of our nations and our peoples.
Mr. President, I told you this morning that I visit you with my friendship and my fault of English. And I continue this this evening. [Laughter] But I think that the best conclusion is to explain as possible as I can, what is the kind of the friendship between your country and mine.
And through your person, Mr. President, permit me to pray God to save your people and your country and to help you in your mission and in your job.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please pray God with me to save the United States and the President of America? Excuse my very bad speech.
THE PRESIDENT. Very wonderful speech. I thank you very much.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"July 16, 1986","
Prime Minister Junejo, distinguished guests, and friends, Nancy and I welcome you to the White House. Mr. Prime Minister, our discussions today were upbeat, cordial, and productive, and will undoubtedly strengthen the bonds of friendship between our two nations. I'm pleased to report that, though today's meeting was our first, we talked with the directness and ease of two long-time colleagues. This tells me, far more than words alone, that the relations between our countries are in good shape and good hands.
Mr. Prime Minister, under your guidance Pakistan is moving toward the realization of its cherished democratic ideals. The democratic path is long and difficult, but free people travel that road together. America is with you, as you proceed toward this noble goal. We want you and the people of Pakistan to know, without doubt, even in the face of increasing Soviet pressures, we stand by you in defense of your sovereignty. Pakistan's determination to see Soviet troops out of Afghanistan strengthens the resolve of free men everywhere. Please take this message back to your people: We salute your courage and are proud of you. With you, we look to the day when a free Afghanistan will again be independent and truly nonaligned, the day when the millions of Afghans who have fled can return to their homes and their land to pursue their own destiny.
It's time to get on with the business of peace. We Americans understand and support the aspirations of the people of Pakistan for greater prosperity and progress in a region free of tension and threats of conflict. And we applaud and strongly support the steady improvement in relations between your country and India, and we're delighted with the commitment Pakistan and its south Asian partners have made to new ventures in regional cooperation.
Mr. Prime Minister, let us build on the solid foundation laid down by American and Pakistani leaders over the years. Our countries continue to share common interests and common goals. By standing together, we can make this a freer and a more peaceful world. Pakistan's national poet-philosopher Mohammad Iqbal once said: ""My life, O God, should be like that of a candle, so that through my efforts I may try to dispel the darkness of evil and illumine the whole world."" Well, Pakistan and the United States, together, can be a light unto the world.
And so, ladies and gentlemen, let us offer a toast to the distinguished Prime Minister of Pakistan and to a future made bright by the light of friendship between our nations and peoples.

state-dinners,George Bush,"January 24, 1990","
President Bush. Mr. President, Barbara and I are delighted to welcome you to the White House. And as I told you earlier today, we have many fond memories of that fascinating visit to Yemen almost 4 years ago. All of us here tonight recognize President Salih as a man of extraordinary accomplishment -- a man who served his nation as a soldier and as a statesman, a man who's led his country at a time of great economic progress and is responsible for Yemen's growing role in Middle Eastern affairs.
Mr. President, as I hope you know by now, I value your views. I believe our discussions and your talks, both today and tomorrow, with so many key members of our administration and the Congress, will encourage understanding between our nations and help us advance the many interests that our nations share. It's been an opportunity to assure you of America's commitment to security in the Middle East and to the pursuit of a just and lasting peace in the region.
In the next few days, you'll be traveling across America -- New York, San Francisco, and on to Dallas, in my home State. And I hope that at every step along the way, you encounter the warm welcome that Barbara and I enjoyed wherever we walked in the streets, in the markets of San`a.
It has been a great pleasure, sir, to welcome you, to be your host on this historic visit -- a visit that signifies the growing ties between our nations and a growing friendship between the people of Yemen and America. And so, tonight I ask all our guests to join me in wishing President Salih health and happiness. In the words of the old Arabian saying, ""He who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everything."" Once again, you are most welcome here in the White House, sir.
President Salih. Dear friend President George Bush; the First Lady, Mrs. Bush; distinguished guests: Allow me first, Mr. President, to congratulate you on the first anniversary of your first term in office. I also wish to express my great pleasure to visit your country, hoping to establish closer linkage between the very ancient in our country and the most modern in yours.
Mr. and Mrs. Bush, dear friends, in October 1962, Time magazine wrote about a country almost unknown to the outside world called Yemen. It said that in this country, which is just rushing toward the 13th century, a revolution took place against a despotic ruler. Since then, human ingenuity and mankind's ability to learn and adapt have made the impossibility an actual reality, because less than 25 years later -- that is, in 1986 -- the people of that unknown country received the Vice President of the most modern and perhaps most famous country in the world.
Mr. President, it was then a wonderful occasion when you and the First Lady joined us in inaugurating our first refinery using Yemeni crude oil at the ancient town of Marib, which once was the cradle of one of the most advanced civilizations of the world. That visit was, in my view, a good omen because it came at the threshold of your campaign for the President of the United States of America. Therefore, I am extremely happy to greet you again and, through you, extend my greetings to the friendly people of the United States.
Thank you, Mr. President.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 12, 1982","
President Reagan. President Figueiredo, Mrs. Figueiredo, distinguished guests, it's an honor and a privilege for Nancy and myself to welcome you to the White House.
The timing of this visit gives us an unexpected opportunity. Yesterday was Mrs. Figueiredo's birthday. [Applause] I hope you'll—well, you already have joined me in wishing her a very happy birthday.
Mr. President, our discussions this morning were satisfying and enjoyable. We spoke freely and frankly, expressing both agreement and disagreement in the same friendly candor. The personal contact we've made and the rapport that we've developed can only serve the interest of both our countries.
I had a particular interest in getting to know the President, not only because of my admiration for Brazil and its people but also because of the courage and the steady hand that he has demonstrated in guiding his country through an especially challenging period in Brazilian history. Mr. President, I have always maintained that when the job to be done is really rough, the horse cavalry can provide the man to do it. [Laughter] And your record bears me out. The President is of the third generation of horse cavalry in his country.
In your annual message to the Brazilian Congress this year, you restated your belief in those ideals that have guided your administration. ""The democracy I envision,"" you said, ""is dynamic and creative. In keeping with this—basic principles, such as private property and free enterprise, which are the bases of freedom itself, will serve the individual society and the ideal of distributive justice."" Well, Mr. President, your commitment to liberty is most encouraging in a world that's grown darker, made so by totalitarian forces.
As President, you have provided your people with innovative and responsive government. In fact, while preparing for our meetings, I came across an idea Americans might do well to emulate. The Brazilian Government has a Cabinet Minister—and I believe he's with us here tonight—whose only job is cutting red tape and returning government programs to the private sector. His title is Minister of Bureaucratization-[ laughter]—De-Bureaucratization. Someone, I hope, is taking notes. [Laughter]
During the welcoming ceremonies this morning, much was said about the long history of friendship between our people. For 158 years our peaceful and amicable relations have been maintained without serious disruption, a tribute to the common sense and common interests of both our peoples. I mentioned our camaraderie during the Second World War, but most significant has been our good will in times of peace.
Mr. President, your visit coincides with one of the most serious challenges to peace this hemisphere has known. I think you know how hard the United States, linked by friendship to both countries involved in the South Atlantic conflict, worked to prevent war and then to bring peace. We all hope and pray that peace efforts now underway in New York will yield fruit.
For our part, the friendship of all countries in the hemisphere is precious to us just as Brazil's is. And we will work to make sure that the inter-American system on which the peace and justice of the hemisphere rest emerges from this time of trial not weakened, but reinforced.
Mr. President, we live in a world dramatically different from the way it was at the close of the Second World War. Every country is now dependent on the cooperation and good will of others. We don't long for days gone by, but instead look to the days ahead, because we see tremendous new opportunities unfolding every day. Let us remember the changing times have not altered the affection between us.
And now, may I ask you all to join me in a toast to the President and Mrs. Figueiredo and to the people of Brazil.
President Figueiredo. Mr. President, distinguished guests, thank you, Mr. President, for your kind words. I believe they convey appreciation for my country and underline the traditional friendship between our peoples.
As a Latin American nation, Brazil has, during the 500 years of its history, helped to build the West. Through the centuries, our contribution has varied, but we have never spared sacrifices, including human lives. Our dialog, Mr. President, has taken place within this broad context.
Brazil is also a developing country. Thus, we share the problems, goals, and aspirations of those states, which today account for most of mankind. This consideration was equally present during our conversations. This is a moment of deterioration of the international political life and of economic crises. My government believes it essential that the West, in which your country plays such a vital role, deploy its best possible efforts to reinforce its ties of mutual trust with the developing world.
I am convinced that the industrialized West should avoid both the temptations of isolationism and of adopting measures geared to its unilateral interests alone. The West should, rather, join in the dialog both on a global level—and I mean here the North-South negotiations—and on more localized political and economic problems and crises.
Mr. President, the opportunity of being in Washington to hold conversations with Your Excellency and to receive high government officials has been extremely valuable. We have exchanged views about problems that are a matter of concern to us and to countries with which we have close and friendly relations. On the one hand, we have reviewed the concrete difficulties with which we are faced. An on the other, we have looked into the wide prospects for reinforcing and diversifying our mutual ties. We have thus given new impetus to our bilateral relations.
I certainly wish to express my gratitude for the warm welcome extended to us by the American Government and people. I will return to Brazil convinced that we have laid the groundwork for the future development of relations that date back to the independence of our country. Such relations are guided by the principles of mutual understanding and respect, as well as by appreciation for the specific interests of each of our countries.
Mr. President, on my own and my wife's behalf, allow me to invite all those present to raise their glasses in a toast to the relations between Brazil and the United States and to your and Mrs. Reagan's personal happiness.

state-dinners,Lyndon B. Johnson,"October 30, 1966","
Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, the Honorable Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen:
We have traveled more than 15,000 miles since we left home 2 weeks ago and tonight we are near the end of our journey through Asia. Soon we will return to our own America.
Nowhere in our travels have we found greater expectations than here in your own country of Malaysia.
For here the promises of a new nation are very bright. Here the accomplishments of orderly and revolutionary development are quite real.
Fifteen years ago the city where we spent the night was a dry in conflict. You were absorbed in fighting the terrorists. Your streets were filled with soldiers and your hospitals were filled with the wounded.
Malaysia was traveling that difficult road along which one of your great neighbors--South Vietnam--tonight toils with such sacrifice.
Yet here today, we have seen what the future can hold for a troubled country.
We see a bright and thriving, modern capital-bursting with energy. We see an inspiring new mosque--symbolizing your trust in God. We see a beautiful new museum-showing your great respect for a very rich past. We see new buildings and new industries that mark your great economic advance and progress.
Three of the world's great peoples have come together here in your nation. They are people who differ in many ways, but who have the will to live together in peace and harmony and with a sense of nationhood.
I know of your many great accomplishments:
--how you have given rural development and education first priority in your federal budget;
--how you have made land available to the landless;
--how you have improved rural health services and rural education for the needy.
You have impressed the entire world with your determination to close the gap between the rich and poor of your own nation--especially by giving the impoverished countryside a chance to share in the growing of the nation and in the promise of the nation. You knew the formula was complicated, you knew it required roads, schools, fair prices for the farmer, available credit, chemical fertilizers, the opportunity for farmers to own land--all of these things together. And you have set about providing them with both imagination and skill.
So, tonight, thank God, Malaysia is at peace.
And equally important, your nation is reaching outward to its neighbors in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. The recent agreement to end Indonesia's confrontation with your country is a historic achievement.
Six years ago Malaysia joined with Thailand and the Philippines in the Association of Southeast Asia, to foster closer cultural and economic ties.
Some said then that the association was ahead of its time.
But it is now clear that ASA was the first step in a larger movement toward common efforts to meet the problems and to realize the promise of Southeast Asia. This movement is now sweeping through Asia.
Asia, like other parts of the world, has for centuries been divided by local and narrow national rivalries. Differences and divisions were more important than common problems and aspirations.
And now all of that is changing. As a Malaysian statesman said: ""Every nation, every group within a nation, has a direct and vital role to play in the coming struggle for unity and plenty.""
Malaysia is playing such a role today. If ASA was a symbol of a new era, Malaysia itself is--in another sense--a symbol of a new hope.
You have demonstrated that an independent nation can rise from long years of bitter struggle against Communist terror to create economic prosperity and to lead in regional cooperation.
For a weary and wartorn land across the South China Sea, Malaysia stands tonight as a symbol of what is possible--and what surely will come to pass.
Throughout Asia, men long to turn aside from fear and turmoil and bloodshed. They seek only the works of peace--a goal that sometimes seems too distant to be attainable.
While I have been in Asia the Communist Chinese have exploded another nuclear weapon, which they state was attached to a missile.
We can only regard the pursuit of national nuclear power by too large a part of the underdeveloped world as a tragedy. For bread is the need of millions who face starvation every day, and bombs are too often purchased at the price of bread.
The pursuit of a national nuclear capability not only makes international arms control, including a nuclear test ban and a nonproliferation treaty, vastly more difficult; it also invites danger to China itself. For the leaders of China must realize that any nuclear capability they can develop can-and will--be deterred. We have already declared that nations which do not seek national nuclear weapons can be sure that they will have our strong support, if they need it, against any threat of nuclear blackmail.
We hope very much that mainland China, like other developing nations, will concentrate its resources on economic development. In this way a truly modern China can emerge on the Mainland. For a peaceful China has nothing to fear from any of us. A peaceful China can expect our friendship and our cooperation. A reckless China can expect vigilance and strength.
All of Asia will gain when the day comes to pass that China is at peace with her neighbors and free from the fears and the suspicions that tonight keep her isolated from the rest of the world.
My friends, I shall forever cherish the memory of this delightful day that I have spent in your land and the reception that you have given me--and Mrs. Johnson--as the representatives of the American people.
The ties that link the Malaysian and American peoples can only become stronger as we pursue our common goals:
--as we build democracy and protect freedom;
--as we resist aggression and subversion;
--as we seek an end to world tensions; and
--as we strive to eliminate ignorance and illiteracy, disease and poverty.
As you move forward, please know--all of you in Malaysia--that you have the friendship of my people.
This has been a pleasant and exciting day and Mrs. Johnson and I shall carry away with us beautiful memories of your land and your people.
May I ask you to join with me in raising your glasses to the King.

[President Obama's remarks were joined in progress.]
President Obama. --representing one of America's strongest allies and global partners, the Republic of Korea.
I also want to acknowledge two guests in particular: another son of Korea dedicated to peace and security, the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, is here; and our first Korean American Ambassador to the Republic of Korea, confirmed by the Senate today, Ambassador Sung Kim.
Now, I'm going to be very brief tonight because President Lee has had a very full day and a very wet day--[laughter]--as well as extended meetings and press conferences, a State Department banquet, and an address to the Congress, which I understand went extraordinarily well. There is a reason why people call him the Bulldozer. He is unstoppable. [Laughter]
Mr. President, today you have spoken with great eloquence about what America and our alliance has meant in your life and the life of your country. This evening I want you and your countrymen to know what Korea and its people have meant to America.
The essence of our alliance, I think, is embodied in a concept that is uniquely Korean. It doesn't translate that easily, but it reflects the deep affection, the bonds of the heart that cannot be broken and that grow stronger with time. Our Korean friends know it well: jeong.
In our country, we've felt this jeong in our vibrant Korean American communities, including in Hawaii, where I grew up, a melting pot of cultures that made me who I am and that taught me we can all live together in mutual trust and respect.
I felt this jeong during my visit to Korea on Veterans Day, the 60th anniversary of the Korean war, when our proud veterans of that war, both Korean and American, came together to celebrate a shared legacy: a free, democratic, and prosperous Republic of Korea.
And I felt this jeong in my friendship with President Lee. Mr. President, your life story--from crushing poverty to the Presidency--is an inspiration. Your success, Korea's success, speaks to the truth that with education and hard work, anything is possible. It's a spirit our countries share. You've described it in Korean, and in English it translates as: ""Yes, we can."" [Laughter] It sounds good in Korean too. [Laughter]
Finally, I would note that in our lives President Lee and I have both been blessed to find our better halves, leaders in their own right, advocates for women and young people, who we are proud to call our First Ladies. Mr. President, as we say in America, we both married up. [Laughter]
And so I want to propose a toast. I believe this is mine.
[At this point, President Obama was handed a glass.]
To our friends President Lee and First Lady Kim, and to their delegation, most of all to the enduring alliance between our nations, a partnership of the heart that will never be broken. Cheers. Gun bae.
[President Obama offered a toast. President Lee then made remarks in Korean, which were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Lee. First of all, Mr. President, Madam First Lady, distinguished guests, please allow me to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this warm reception extended to me, my wife, and my delegation. Thank you very much.
And Mr. President and Madam First Lady, my visit to Washington, DC, this time is especially special because before you are the President of the United States of America, you are a very close friend of mine. And this is how I consider you as well as the Madam First Lady. So this visit is very, very special for all of us.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President just spoke about the Korean emotion that we call jeong in Korean. I think indeed President Obama knows that deep inside his heart, he understands the essence of what we call jeong. Jeong can be explained in many different aspects, but one aspect of that is an individual that is humble, yet very strong inside. And I think President Obama exemplifies this trait of what we call jeong, and that is why we have a very special tie that we feel whenever I think about President Obama. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a very, very honest guy--[laughter]--so what I say, I really mean it.
And also, Mr. President, I must thank you for one thing, because you have spoken so highly of the outstanding educational system of Korea and the dedication of its teachers and the determination of our Korean parents when it comes to educating their children. You have so many new teacher fans in Korea. [Laughter] And I have to be very honest with you. I think you have quite a number of them who like you more than they like me. [Laughter]
But, Mr. President, seriously, you do have a lot of teacher fans in Korea. But the real reason, when we look deep down inside, the reason why you are so popular among many Koreans is because everyone, including myself, are deeply impressed by your endless passion for learning and that this is very much a--very much reflected in your life story.
Mr. President, Madam First Lady, ladies and gentlemen, whenever I think about the United States and the people of America, I also have a very personal story of mine, which I would like to share with you briefly tonight. As you know, 60 years ago Korea used to be one of the poorest countries in the world. My family was exceptionally poor, and we really had nothing to eat, nothing to wear. We had to rely on foreign aid for many, many years. And I remember--I think I was about 9 or 10 years old--in my village there came an American missionary lady with boxes and containers full of used clothes that she would come to my village and hand out.
So being a boy whose only wish at that time was to own and wear a pair of blue jeans, I decided to stand in line, along with many people. But I was a very small and shy boy--hard to imagine--[laughter]--so a lot of people were pushing, and they were jostling about. So I ended up way at the end of the line. When my turn came, I went up to the American missionary lady, and I asked for a pair of blue jeans, to which she said--she just looked at me and said, ""Well, I'm sorry, I'm all out of blue jeans."" And of course, I was devastated. I was heartbroken. And this kind American missionary lady takes one look at me, and out of sympathy she hands me something out of the box. She handed me a small rubber ball. Now, this did little to console the boy who was crushed, and because, after all, what was I going to do with a rubber ball?
And so to this day--and I shared this story with President Obama, and I--when I finished the story I remember the President laughing a bit nervously though. But--[laughter]--I told him, I said, ""Mr. President, as you can see, I do not owe the United States anything, except""--[laughter]--""except maybe for a rubber ball."" [Laughter]
So, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President, Madam First Lady, although half-jokingly I say that I do not owe the United States anything, but in reality, my country and my people owe you tremendously. Which other country--no country came to aid the Republic of Korea 60 years ago when my country was being attacked by Communists. No country sacrificed more than 37,000 lives defending freedom for the people of my country. So for that, for many, many years onwards, we will always, always be grateful to the American people.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, just last night, the United States Congress passed and ratified the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. I've said this before, but please allow me to say it again: I am deeply appreciative and grateful to the leadership of Congress, to all the Members of the United States Congress who supported this measure, and especially to the steadfast leadership of President Obama for pushing this through.
And also, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that there are those in the United States Congress who did not vote ""yea"" for this very important agreement. I think I see a few faces here, maybe--[laughter]--but I'm very, very confident, ladies and gentlemen, that in 1 year or even less, that these people who may be a little bit critical of this important agreement will say that they made a mistake, because they will see the visible results of this very important agreement.
And the thing that I want to prove the most, ladies and gentlemen, with the KORUS FTA is that many of those critics were saying that the KORUS FTA was somehow going to make people lose their jobs, but really the KORUS FTA is going to create a lot of good, decent jobs for the people of America. And this is a point that I want to prove by implementing this agreement.
And, ladies and gentlemen, you see Mr. King seated at the head table here. As I was receiving guests, and when he came up to me and I was shaking hands, I thought to myself, this is my chance to explain to Mr. King that the KORUS FTA is going to create a lot of good jobs for his people and the members of his union.
Well, the fact that Mr. King accepted the invitation to be here tonight just goes to show that he believes in the essence and the core values of the KORUS FTA, so I have no worries. [Laughter]
Mr. President, Madam First Lady, ladies and gentlemen, our relationship between our two countries began 130 years ago. Sixty years ago, our mutual defense treaty began what is considered to be one of the strongest military and political alliance that the world has ever known. Of course, we are here today to celebrate our journey of the last 60 years, one that has been--always been marked by triumphs, sometimes heartache, but always full of hope. And we are gathered here to reaffirm our friendship and to renew our common commitment towards our shared goals. I know that our relationship will go strong; it will become more mature and complete.
Mr. President, as we talked about over the last few days, we have many, many challenges that are facing us as a nation and as a member of the international community. We do not know when, what type of form, or how it is going to strike us. There is a lot of uncertainty out there. But I believe in our friendship, because when during--if we are faced with challenges, I know that we will overcome them and even come out stronger.
And I just want to emphasize once again, our alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States ensures us that we are not alone. Neither is Korea alone or the United States. So we can have confidence that we will be able to overcome any challenges that may face us.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I see the guests today, and I think a lot of you are people who are very much liked by the President and the Madam First Lady. I also see a few of you who I always wanted to see, and so I'm very happy that I have a chance to see and meet with you tonight.
And so once again, Mr. President, Madam First Lady, thank you so much for this honor, and thank you for your invitation.
[President Lee spoke in English.]
Okay. I'm going to propose toast for us. [Laughter]
[President Lee continued in Korean, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me now in a toast: First of all, for the health and well-being of President Obama and Madam First Lady, and of course, for our everlasting friendship between our two countries. Cheers.
[President Lee offered a toast.]

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"August 26, 2000","
President Obasanjo, to the President of Niger, to the distinguished leaders of the legislative and judicial branches of the Nigerian Government, and all our friends from Nigeria who are here, I believe I can speak for the entire American delegation when I say thank you all for an unforgettable day.
And on a very personal basis, I want to thank you for enabling me to say something no previous American President has been able to say: It is good to be back in Africa for the second time.
I will say, Mr. President, I was very moved by your generous remarks, and I was very glad to have a Nigerian name. [Laughter] But now, you will have to give me a copy of your remarks so that when we go out tomorrow, I can introduce myself properly to the people of your country. [Laughter]
Mr. President, it's a great honor for all of us to be here. I wish that my wife could come, and your remarks indicated you understand why she could not. But I am grateful for her interest in Africa as well, and especially in the Vital Voices program that so many Nigerian women have been a part of.
We meet at a pivotal moment in your history. The long-deferred dreams of your people finally can and must be realized. I spoke about it in detail to the members of the Senate and the House today. I will only repeat that it is a daunting challenge, requiring both rigorous effort and realistic patience.
Nigeria is poised to do great things for its own people and for Africa's democratic destiny. We in the United States have long known Nigeria as an economic partner and an important supplier of energy. But now, more than ever, we and others throughout the world will know and honor Nigeria for its greatest energy resource, the people of this great nation.
We have come to appreciate it in many ways: the musical genius of King Sunny Ade; the brilliant writing of Chinua Achebe; and your Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka. We also think rather highly of the basketball feats of Hakeem Olajuwon. And we're coming more and more to appreciate the football brilliance of the Super Eagles. Indeed, every 4 years a growing number of people in the United States actually cheer for the Super Eagles in the World Cup. After all, the eagle is America's national bird, too. [Laughter] And more importantly, tens of thousands of Nigerians work and study in the United States, and we are honored to have them.
I was quite interested, Mr. President, in the presentation before your remarks showing all the similarities between you and me. I would also like a copy of that. [Laughter] I don't know if I could persuade people back home with a case without all that evidence.
For all our differences, even in a larger sense, we are not so different after all. Our Capital— Washington, DC—like yours here, was created as a compromise between North and South. Though I must say, ours took much longer to become a respectable city. And as I saw today when I addressed your legislative branch, your Government, like ours, often displays what might charitably be called a creative tension between its different branches. [Laughter] Finally, our greatest strength, like yours, comes from the fact that we are many peoples striving to work as one.
Mr. President, the hope we celebrate this evening owes much to you, for you have twice answered the call to restore civilian government. The United States will stand by a nation, any nation, and especially Nigeria, that faces its responsibility as bravely as the people of this nation have in the last few years.
We outlined today our commitments, and we will keep them, to help you economically, educationally, in the struggles against AIDS and other public health problems and the struggles to rebuild your infrastructure in our common cause to restore peace in Sierra Leone and to support Nigeria as a leader for peace throughout the continent. And we look forward to fulfilling those commitments.
I listened again to the case you made tonight, a case that I also heard from your legislative leaders this afternoon and first in our meeting this morning and, of course, even earlier when you and I first met. I will do my best to help Nigeria succeed economically. You must do so.
When Nigeria became independent in late 1960, almost 40 years ago now, the American people were also quite happy, because it was a time of great hope for us at home and around the world. We felt it in the new beginnings of President Kennedy's election and the progress of the civil rights struggle in our own country and with the crumbling of colonialism here and around the world.
We were proud that some of your early independence leaders, like Nnamdi Azikiwe, studied in America. In 1959 this is what he told an American audience. He said, ""We struggle toward the same ultimate objective: to revive the stature of man so that man's inhumanity to man shall cease. Your success shall be our success, and your failure shall be our failure.""
Since he said those words to Americans, there have been great achievements and profound setbacks in both our nations. But those words are as true today as they were when they were spoken. And today, we have the best chance since the early 1960's to make them come true.
And so tonight Mr. President and all our distinguished Nigerian friends, let me repeat your hero's words back to you: Now and forever, your success shall be our success.
I ask you to join me in a toast to the President of Nigeria and to the people of Nigeria, to the success of the democratic experiment here, to the friendship between our peoples, and to our common commitment to seize the future together.
[At this point, the President offered a toast.]

state-dinners,George Bush,"October 03, 1989","
President Bush. To President and Mrs. Salinas and honored guests and ladies and gentlemen, Barbara and I are just delighted to welcome you to the White House. Your country, sir, has often extended to us that kindness for which Mexico is so famous. And tonight, we are honored to have you both here.
We first met last November, sir, in Houston, Texas. We met, if I might add this personal note, the day after your Harvard football team fell to the mighty men of Yale. It seemed at the time like an inauspicious start, somehow, but we've learned anew how special the relationship -- you're trying to get even -- [laughter] -- the relationship between Mexico and the United States can be, this relationship which has been and continues to be bound by so many ties. And we've become good friends. And those ties, of course, include our 2,000-mile border and billions of dollars in trade.
And they're educational, they're political, they're economic, they're environmental. And our ties rest on respect, maturity, and communication, consultation. And the values that we cherish links our cultures -- values of faith, family, and respect for tradition.
As a young man, Mr. President, you did study in the United States. And you know us well, and you came to understand our ties. And I, too, revere them, for as a Texan, I've lived many years side by side with Mexico and know and appreciate your beautiful country and its wonderful people. Such understanding, I think, leads to trust, and such trust can lead to progress.
Speaking of trust, I trust that you dried out from the golf cart tour of Camp David on Sunday. [Laughter] There was a true downpour. President and Mrs. Salinas came up there in the mountains. But I was anxious for the President to look around, so he and I set out on a golf cart in this driving rain. Barbara was convinced that I had just dealt a severe blow to Mexican-United States relations. [Laughter]
It is this kind of trust that I'm talking about. For, from its earliest days, your administration has acted as our neighbor and equal partner, and known that by applying our resources to common problems we can ensure a richer life for all.
Now, let us determine to do more. And let us increase bilateral trade and achieve economic growth. Let's expand cooperation and enhance investment opportunity. And let us support democracy in our hemisphere, and thus, regional security and stability. We must also reaffirm our commitment to combating narcotics -- that is both a national priority and a hemispheric crusade. And I thank you, sir, for your fantastic cooperation in this regard, for unless we defeat drug use and trafficking, we will help rob our children of their very dreams.
There's an ancient proverb which goes: ""God guides whom he wills to a straight path."" Mr. President, let our path be straight and true, affirming all that which unites us, and so enrich this generation and all the generations to come. In that spirit, I ask all of you, our guests here this evening, to rise and raise your glasses to Mexican-American friendship, to a better world for our children and all children, and to the health and happiness of our friend and colleague, the President of Mexico, and Mrs. Salinas.
President Salinas. President George Bush, Mrs. Barbara Bush, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: I would like at this dinner to express my gratitude to the people and Government of the United States for the warmth they have shown towards the Mexican delegation which I head. I have found in President George Bush a friend who is not only worthy of esteem, but also an outstanding leader who, in the short time he has been in office, has managed to give a new thrust to the United States and to national relations based on the human understanding that is the legacy of freedom handed down by the Founding Fathers of this great republic.
We Mexicans, President Bush, have been witnesses to your willingness to engage in frank, open, and substantive dialog. This has been a good starting point for embarking on a different phase in our bilateral relation. The same applies to the Congressmen and officials with whom we have held fruitful talks on both sides of the border that have led to improved understanding between our peoples.
I have come to the United States with the intention of establishing a new relationship of friendship free of myths and mistrust. I have come determined to stress common points of view and shared ideals, to pave the way for a mutually respectful, united and solitary progress as neighbors towards the future. We are aware of the historical difficulties that we have had in our relations and of the problems that are still pending. Nevertheless, we are sure that the time has come to derive mutual benefits from the advantages of the border that joins us, thereby strengthening the identity of each nation at a time of profound worldwide changes.
In Mexico, we are presently experiencing a time of renewed social optimism. On concluding an important stage in the process of renegotiating the foreign debt a few months ago, we provided Mexicans with a new horizon for progress. I extend my gratitude to President Bush for the understanding and solidarity he has shown, which enabled us to reach a successful outcome to this important process so essential for our growth.
In Mexico, we are determined to modernize our country. We Mexicans are seeking the best way to mobilize the full potential of social energy, of groups, and of regions. Despite a severe economic crisis, we have not succumbed to apathy or despair. With strong institutions, we are currently striving to regain our growth and to continue transforming our economic structures and renovating our political practices. Rights and responsibilities are now becoming a salient feature of all social activities, the economy, and politics. The needs and dreams of Mexicans, especially those of modest means, demand this major transformation.
Trade exchanges worldwide have intensified significantly with the shortening of distances. Accordingly, exchanges between our countries are increasingly dynamic and diversified. Trade offers an extraordinary potential for mutual benefits and for growth, which is essential for my country. Few economies have opened up as much and as rapidly as Mexico's. A similar opening up of the American market would not only represent reciprocal treatment but a stimulus to our new friendship. A renewed period of gradual growth will enable us to assign resources to investment, to the strengthening of the domestic market, and to the generation of employment for the one million young people who currently demand it. My aim is for all Mexicans to find work in Mexico. However, the differences between our economies attracts Mexican labor to contribute to the development of the United States. We can do much to abolish mistreatment of workers on both sides of the border and to ensure respect for their dignity.
My government views the in-depth fight against drug trafficking as a tireless battle. We have not hesitated to resort to political will and economic resources to put an end to the international crime. Many Mexican lives have been lost in this struggle. We know, however, that stamping out the traffic in drugs is a matter of national security to us, of preserving the health of our youth and the basic principle of international solidarity in the face of an evil that affects us all. No one can feel untouched by it as long as there are teenagers trapped in addiction while their families look on helplessly.
Bilateral cooperation between our countries will be enriched by concrete actions undertaken by both governments to halt environmental pollution on our common border, to make joint progress in restoring the purity of the air and water in both territories, and to engage in common efforts to protect the tropical forests that are the lungs of the world. Allow me to add, Mr. President, that with this cooperation regarding the environment and to halt environmental pollution, that will enable the children in Mexico to paint the sky blue again and to find the stars in the sky.
Out of culture, a valiant history -- invincible in the face of adversity -- has been forged. It is the source of our self-assurance, our identity, in opening our doors to the world and participating in its transformation. By strengthening ourselves as an independent nation in today's interdependent world, cooperation between us will prosper and our relation as neighbors will become the new friendship of the coming decade.
President Bush, Mrs. Bush, you have given us a cordial welcome. In it, we see the spirit that sums up what has always existed between our peoples: the hope of sharing an era of mutual benefits, of exploring areas of agreement, and of working side by side to shape a future of mutual prosperity. By joining our efforts, our two governments can more clearly hear the wise, generous voice of the men and women who give meaning to this meeting.
President Bush, in this new stage of respect and friendship, let us join now in a toast to the strength of Mexico and of the United States; to a hemisphere with peace, democracy, and development; to the beginning of a new friendship that inspires us to live up to the expectations of our peoples; and to your own well-being and that of your family.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"June 07, 2011","
The President. Good evening. Guten Abend. Michelle and I are honored to welcome you as we host Chancellor Merkel, Professor Sauer, and the German delegation for the first official visit and state dinner for a European leader during my Presidency.
Angela, you and the German people have always shown me such warmth during my visits to Germany. I think of your gracious hospitality in Dresden. I think back to when I was a candidate and had that small rally in Berlin's Tiergarten. [Laughter] So we thought we'd reciprocate with a little dinner in our Rose Garden.
Now, it's customary at these dinners to celebrate the values that bind nations. Tonight we wanted to do something different. We wanted to pay tribute to an extraordinary leader who embodies these values and who's inspired millions around the world, including me, and that's my friend Chancellor Merkel.
More than five decades ago, in 1957, the first German Chancellor ever to address our Congress, Konrad Adenauer, spoke of his people's ""will of freedom"" and of the millions of his countrymen forced to live behind an Iron Curtain. And one of those millions, in a small East German town, was a young girl named Angela.
She remembers when the wall went up and how everyone in her church was crying. Told by the Communists that she couldn't pursue her love of languages, she excelled as a physicist. Asked to spy for the secret police, she refused. And the night the wall came down, she crossed over, like so many others, and finally experienced what she calls the ""incredible gift of freedom.""
Tonight we honor Angela Merkel not for being denied her freedom or even for attaining her freedom, but for what she achieved when she gained her freedom. Determined to finally have her say, she entered politics, rising to become the first East German to lead a united Germany, the first woman Chancellor in German history, and an eloquent voice for human rights and dignity around the world.
The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest honor a President can bestow on a civilian. Most honorees are Americans; only a few others have received it, among them Pope John Paul II, Nelson Mandela, and Helmut Kohl. So please join me in welcoming Chancellor Merkel for the presentation of the next Medal of Freedom.
[At this point, Maj. Reginald McClam, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President, read the citation, and the President presented the medal.]
The President. You can all applaud. [Laughter]
[Chancellor Merkel moved to the podium, but the President then returned to the podium and continued his remarks as follows.]
I've got to do the toast. [Laughter] I want to conclude by inviting all of you to stand and join me in a toast. And I want to do so with the words that Angela spoke 2 years ago when she became the first German leader to address our Congress since Chancellor Adenauer all those decades ago.
Her words spoke not only to the dreams of that young girl in the East, but to the dreams of all who still yearn for their rights and dignity today: To freedom, which ""must be struggled for, and then defended anew, every day of our lives.""
Cheers. Zum Wohl.
[Chancellor Merkel then gave brief remarks.]
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"November 02, 1981","
The President. Your Majesties and distinguished guests:
King Hussein once explained the three virtues upon which Bedouin life is based, saying, ""We believe to be an honorable man, you must have the courage to defend your honor; we believe you must always show hospitality; and what is yours belongs to your guests."" Tonight it gives me great pleasure to extend American hospitality to King Hussein and lovely Queen Noor. We cannot hope to match the graciousness of the Bedouins, but we do hope you'll consider what is ours is yours.
Having been a longtime friend of this country and the guest of many Presidents, His Majesty probably has been to dinner in this room more often than I have. [Laughter]
I've been told that early in his reign, King Hussein decided that he should know exactly what was on the minds of his people. So one night he commandeered a taxicab and then took over and posed as the cabdriver and ventured into Amman. It turned out to be a lively night. He picked up a fellow carrying a heavy bag of vegetables and then engaged him in conversation. And being modest and wanting to find out what they really thought, cabdriver Hussein was not exactly complimentary about King Hussein. [Laughter] And not knowing to whom he was talking, the faithful subject, the passenger in the cab, told the cabdriver that he'd beat him black and blue with a stick if he heard anything more said against the King. That fellow is probably still wondering why the cabdriver tipped him. [Laughter]
There can be little wonder, however, about why this citizen loved his monarch. King Hussein well represents the character of his people. His grandfather described this character. ""The Arab,"" King Abdullah wrote, ""has a penchant for unfettered liberty and cannot abide restriction or restraint. This is the reason why he has associated with the desert and the steppe and exhibits an incomparable bravery in defending his possessions. He is courageous and fond of oratory as well as poetry and love.""
Tonight, we honor a man for whom liberty has personal as well as political meaning. Heads of state often find themselves restricted by their own staffs. King Hussein, for example, was once told that he could pilot airplanes as long as he didn't fly solo. His aides now know better. [Laughter] Today when many Americans think of King Hussein, an image of a swashbuckling pilot strapping himself into a jet comes to mind. And however attractive that image may be, it's Hussein's integrity that captures the hearts of Americans.
We are here to honor a head of state who's been a leader in the search for a just and lasting Middle East peace. Such a peace has been one of the most vexing international problems in the post-war world. Yet His Majesty has never abandoned the belief that people of good will, through dedication and vision, can find the means to bring peace with dignity, justice, and security to his region.
Our talks today ranged over numerous issues. The path ahead is fraught with both danger and opportunity. After our conversation, I remain certain we will walk this path as friends. Where we differed, we did so in that spirit and discussed how we can work together in complementary ways to achieve our shared goals.
Your Majesty, I learned much from our discussions. Furthermore, it's been a great delight getting to know you.
And now, I would ask all of you to join me in a toast to Their Majesties, King Hussein and Queen Noor, and to the long-abiding friendship between our two peoples.
The King. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, no words would adequately express the warmth of feelings that I have within me, the pride in a friendship that has meant so much, between our nations, and which has weathered storms and which has lasted for only a fraction of the time, I hope, it will last. For I am convinced, sir, that what is between us in terms of the ideals that are dear to us, the principles we uphold, the hopes and dreams, aspirations for a better tomorrow, the dedication to those ideals and principles, and the commitment to the cause of a better tomorrow with peace and dignity in our part of the world, or anywhere else, are elements that will always keep us together as brethren and as friends, proud of this friendship, ever determined to make our contribution to the fullest possible extent.
Sir, you have kindly spoken of some of the Bedouin traditions. I am proud to belong to the oldest tribe in Arabia, but I would like to say very frankly and sincerely that if we were to be outdone, you have succeeded in that respect in the warmth of your reception and the feelings that I have felt on this day that I shall always remember. Twenty-five years, sir, and then, many an occasion when I visited the United States and had the privilege of meeting with the leaders of this great Nation, yet no visit has been more important than this one, at this time, at this point in history.
I am one of many in this world who have had a very deep admiration for you and respect for your courage, for the fact that you have always stood in defense of principles and ideals. And throughout these many years, we have been proud to belong to the family of free nations, and the cause of freedom and justice is very dear to us.
I must say, sir, I have been looking forward to this privilege and pleasure of meeting you. And before we met this morning, I was feeling the weight of the responsibility I bore, because there is so much at stake in terms which I can't even express, in terms of all that is important, for now and for tomorrow.
I can only say, sir, that having had this privilege, I feel more encouraged than I have felt for a long, long period of time; a greater faith that all will eventually be right; pride in knowing you, pride in our friendship. You, to us, are an example—all the human, wonderful qualities that are yours.
There are many areas where we have common treasured possessions as well, sir. I was reminded today of the fact, when we were having lunch, that we were talking and sitting ""Philadelphia style,"" I believe was the expression used. I was reminded of the fact that we came from another Philadelphia. That is the name of the capital of Jordan, its ancient name. And Philadelphia here for you is the beacon for freedom and the beginnings of the creation of this, one of the greatest nations of all times, the City of Brotherly Love.
There is much that we share. There is faith in our hearts. There is a commitment to do our best and to work together to obtain our common goals and objectives. I pray to God to grant you always good health and every continued success, sir, in your great duties as the head of this great Nation and its leader and in fulfilling your tasks and facing up to the challenge for a better future for all mankind.
I'll carry back with me, as will Noor and all the Jordanian friends, colleagues who have come with us on this trip to the United States, very treasured memories of this day.
Thank you both so much for your kindness, for this wonderful opportunity to be with friends, for the warmth of your welcome. God bless you, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to join me in making a toast to President Reagan, President of the United States, to Mrs. Reagan, and to brotherly love, to friendship everlasting, and to a better tomorrow.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"April 12, 1978","
PRESIDENT CARTER. I think it's the guests that we have, but I believe the Strolling Strings sounded better tonight than any time I've ever heard them, and I want to thank you for bringing out the best in them. I thought it was just very wonderful.
How many of you here either came from a foreign country to our Nation or had your parents or grandparents come from a foreign country? Raise your hand, if you would.
Mr. President, you can see more than half. It's obviously more than half of the people here who have come to the United States from a foreign country, most of you from Europe. And I think this in itself demonstrates vividly to our distinguished guest how close the ties are between our Nation and his and those nations that are neighbors of his.
We are indeed honored to have all of you here tonight, and particularly honored to have President Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, and the distinguished ministers of his government come to visit the White House, the First Family of our country, and the people of the United Mr. President, you are welcome to our country.
We paid him a special honor today, perhaps unprecedented in the history of our Nation. We played two different national anthems to Romania— [laughter] -the incorrect one this morning and the correct one tonight. And I think this gives us an excellent opportunity to judge the tremendous progress that has been made in Romania— [laughter] —because I like the one tonight much better, Mr. President.
It's always an exciting thing for us to have distinguished leaders from other nations come to visit us, and we always like to put our best foot forward and not only entertain our guests but to let them know what a great country we have.
I was particularly eager to impress the President's wife tonight, because she, on her own, is a distinguished scientist, a chemist, has done great research work. And I was very careful to place on her left someone who could speak her language about science and about whom I could brag as a distinguished American to show how superior our country was. As a matter of fact, Dr. Palade1 is a Nobel laureate, and I wanted to let Mrs. Ceausescu know how advanced we were in training Americans to win the foremost prize in all the world. So, I was explaining it to her very carefully, and in the middle of my very proud dissertation, he pointed out to me he was born, raised, and trained in Romania. [Laughter] So we learned a lot about each other.
I've had a delightful day with the President of this great country. I think it's accurate to point out that as the leader of his great nation, he's not only brought tremendous progress to Romania but also has taken on a role of leadership in the entire international community that's notable.
He's been dedicated to the proposition that a nation was sovereign, that its territorial integrity should be honored, that its people should be independent, and that in spite of this complete commitment to the pride of one's own nation, that there should be bridges built, not only to other countries from your own but between other countries that have difficulty in communicating because of different political and economic organizations within their own countries.
He was one of the first leaders, I think, who saw the benefits, economically, politically, militarily, in detente, and he's been a foremost proponent in trying to bridge the gap between the Warsaw Pact nations and the NATO countries. He has a unique ability to relate easily to leaders of nations, regardless of their political commitment or orientation or background or history or conviction about the present or future status of their countries.
He's been very helpful to me and my predecessors in the White House in trying to bring messages directly from leaders with whom we don't communicate became of an absence of diplomatic interrelationships, and has provided a bridge for the easing of tensions and the better understanding on a worldwide basis.
As a member of the developing nations of the world, he's been able to be an evocative and a very effective spokesman in acquainting the industrial nations of the world about how we could interrelate more easily and more effectively with a group of countries who quite often are not well organized or not willing to sit down and calmly negotiate the way to alleviate the wide disparity in economic benefits.
He's the leader of one of the few Eastern European nations who is a member of the Group of 77, now comprising about 95 countries. And I think this shows the breadth of his vision and the commitment that he has to bridge those gaps that I've just described.
We've got an excellent relationship with Romania. I think it's been growing steadily and on a very sound basis for the last 10 years or more.
This is the President's fourth trip to our country, and after he leaves Washington shortly, he'll be going to other places in the United States. He'll be going to Chattanooga, to Dallas, to Houston, to Orlando. He'll also be visiting New York. Unfortunately, he won't get to Georgia- [laughter] —on this trip. He's going to save that for dessert when he comes back on his next trip.
But he knows our country. He's studied it with a great deal of interest, and he's been one of the people who have made notable progress among other countries that are in the most intense disputes at this point.
I would say more than any other leader, certainly including myself, he was responsible for the historic visit of President Sadat of Egypt to Jerusalem and Israel.
By the way, the capital of Israel is Tel Aviv and not Jerusalem. 2
And we have seen that this ability of his has paid rich dividends to us. Romania was one of those countries instrumental in evolving the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, that we refer to in our country most often as the Helsinki agreement. And at Belgrade, which he described this morning as a disappointment, he was very eager to try to move forward to a much more substantive accomplishment that might be realized at the next meeting, scheduled to be in Madrid.
We are very proud that the Helsinki conference agreement includes the Third Basket, which covers more deeply than ever before the question that is of profound importance to our country, that is, basic human rights. And we have an ability, President Ceausescu and myself, his ministers and mine, to discuss ways by which we might move, perhaps in different means and at different rates of advance, to bring about those basic human rights that our people so urgently need-the reunification of families and the basic freedoms that are important to us.
I've enjoyed being with him. He's a very good adviser. He's a man who in the past has suffered greatly, imprisoned, tortured, but because of his courage and because of his belief in the future of his own country, notable achievements have been brought to the people who have confidence in him.
It's a great pleasure for me again to express my welcome to him to our country, and I would like to propose a toast to a great leader, President Ceausescu, and to the brave and friendly people of Romania. Mr. President, to you and your people.
PRESIDENT CEAUSESCU. Mr. President, Mrs. Carter, ladies and gentlemen:
It is for myself, for my wife, and for the members of my party a reason of special pleasure to be your guests here tonight, to be again here in the United States, to meet again many citizens of your lovely country.
Today we had the first round of talks on a rather large sphere of problems, and we have also reached a numbers of common conclusions.
The first regards the need to establish broader cooperation between our two countries and to take more sustained efforts towards peace, towards more democratic international relations, and towards ensuring to each and every nation the right to live in freedom and to develop according to their own aspirations.
You said, Mr. President, that many people here in the United States have come from Europe or other parts of the world. I cannot boast that many Romanians have come from other parts of the world, because for almost 2,050 years—because in 1980 we are going to celebrate the 2,050th anniversary of the first centralized nation state in Romania-Romanians have been there, and they are going to stay there. They fought to be free, and they want to be always free.
In many ways the history of our two respective countries are different, and the present is also different from a number of viewpoints. The United States is a developed country and a big country. Romania is a smaller country and a still developing country. But it is our wish, by relying on the labors and efforts of our own people, to develop on broader lines, to gain access to modern science, to civilization, and to live a life of dignity, freedom, and independence.
I think that despite all differences, including differences in social systems, there are many things that can be common to our two countries and to our two peoples, and mainly our common wish for progress, our wish to see that the accomplishments of human genius are put in the service of happiness of all peoples. No doubt, also, we have a common determination to do everything we can in order to see to it that the wonderful achievements of science should not serve destruction and war, but the progress, well-being, and happiness of each people and of all peoples.
I think that that is precisely the supreme rationale of human existence, and that is also the fundamental problem, the core of human rights—the right to be free, the right and the duty to respect the freedom of others, and the duty to work in such a way in order to enjoy himself or herself and let others enjoy the benefits of civilization.
Maybe on certain aspects of human rights we might have different philosophical concepts, and there is nothing wrong in that. But we in Romania set out from the premise that everything we do should serve the well-being of the people, should help all people live life with more dignity and more freedom. And we have a saying in Romania that the little we have, we should distribute fairly for all to enjoy.
You told me tonight, Mr. President, about your Presidential campaign in the early stages and how you really got elected President. It's wonderful that you could win over all obstacles, and now to have a farmer at the head of the United States, and also a farmer's son, and that I used to work in the fields, I used to work in factories, and we have there in Romania a farmer's son who has worked all his life with his hands, and he's now a President, too.
Maybe that helps our people also understand that whatever we do is for the people to benefit and for them to live life with more dignity.
As a matter of fact, if I remember right, either the first or the second President of the United States used to be a worker, and the founding father of scientific socialism, Marx, used to say and to quote that as an example of how a working man can rise to the highest dignity of office.
Now when we talk about human rights, it is good to remember all these things, because the rights of all human beings begin with the right to work, with the right to learn, with the right to have access to culture, with the right to live in freedom, and also with the right to participate in the management of all national affairs without discrimination. And this also includes the right to have any creed, either religious or philosophical.
We endeavor to respect such rights fully, and we regard them as sacred. We think that everything should be done and no effort should be spared in order to have those rights asserted in all countries, so that they become a basis for equal cooperation among all nations.
That is why we take a stand against all wars and for disarmament, first of all for nuclear disarmament. That is why we believe that the world should cease to be divided into opposing military blocs and new relations should be built in a world without military blocs.
That is why we stand for a political solution in the Middle East. That is why we welcomed President Sadat's initiative, and now we are hopeful that his efforts will and the others will lead to a just and lasting peace in the area.
That is also the reason why we wish to see new relations established in Europe and the documents signed in Helsinki implemented in full.
As there are more baskets than one, we would wish that all should be implemented, and more progress should be made in particular on the military side of it, considering that in Europe, where many Americans of today have come from, we have to deal with the highest concentration of forces and modem armaments.
You know Europe. You know Europe is not such a big place, and little place is now left for anything but arms. So, we shall have to remove them to make place for people. That is why, while giving attention to the Third Basket, we should also give more attention to military disengagement and disarmament.
These are the same reasons why we support the liberation movements in Rhodesia and Namibia and the majority in South Africa, their right to be free, to decide their own future, and to participate in the management of their own affairs.
Finally, I shouldn't fail to mention the fact that two-thirds of mankind are poor, and one-third is relatively rich, because not all are rich in that one-third. That makes it necessary, in our view, to join the efforts with these people, with the developing nations, in order to secure their more rapid economic and social progress. Without this we can hardly say that all nations can enjoy the fruits of modem civilization.
We would certainly welcome with great satisfaction more active support from the United States to the solution of these worldwide problems, if more is done for this two-thirds of mankind that live in poverty. Of course, I have in mind not only the United States but all developed countries, all those who are able to take action in order to bring new solutions to the vital problems of mankind.
We know well that just a few countries, even if they are as big as the United States, cannot solve all these problems. What is needed is for all peoples. all nations to join their efforts in order to bring about solutions that would be up to the expectations and aspirations of all people. I am convinced that despite the difficulties, that all the nations of the world will be able to bring about new solutions to the problems we are facing and to build together a better world, a would with more justice.
We wish that our visit here and our talks together should help us identify new fields for cooperation between Romania and the United States, but at the same time should provide new opportunities for cooperation with a view to solving the problems that confront humanity today.
I should like to propose this toast for better cooperation between Romania and the United States, for a more democratic international policy. I wish the people of America prosperity and peace for all. To your health, President Carter, to the health of Mrs. Carter. We are looking forward to seeing you in Romania. To your health, everybody.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"November 22, 1999","
President Stoyanov, Mrs. Stoyanov; Prime Minister and Mrs. Kostov; distinguished government leaders; citizens of Bulgaria; our American friends. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking you for your warm welcome. This is a day that I will remember for the rest of my life. You gave my wife a memorable day here not so long ago, and our daughter and I had a wonderful time today in so many ways, a few of which I would like to mention.
But first let me begin with the time President Stoyanov came to the White House. Hillary and I welcomed him there a couple of years ago, and I was very interested in this young President of Bulgaria, so I read up on him.
He was only a little younger than me. He looks much younger, but he's only a little. [Laughter] He studied the law. His wife studied law. He's a father who likes to jog. He likes to read. He grew up listening to rock and roll, just like me. [Laughter] The only difference I could find from our biographies is that he liked John Lennon, and I liked Elvis. [Laughter]
Earlier today on Nevsky Square I had the opportunity to speak to a vast and immensely impressive throng of Bulgarians about the new partnership we are forging for democracy, peace, and prosperity.
Mr. President, as you pointed out in your remarks, the relationships between our two countries and our mutual admiration goes back quite a long while. Perhaps the best symbol of this is the American college here, which I learned, as I prepared to come, was actually first opened in the year Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States, 1860.
During the dark days after World War II, the college was closed. The war first brought its closure and then afterward, in the communist era, its grounds were turned over to the secret police. But Americans and Bulgarians never lost faith that it would open again one day, because we never lost faith that Bulgaria would be free again one day.
A few years after the school reopened, our Ambassador at the time, Ambassador Bohlen, took a trip to the famous Rila Monastery, and right before she left, the abbot came up to her and said, ""I have a secret to show you."" They walked to a basement, and there in a hidden place was the entire library of the American college, preserved for 50 years by the same monastery that helped to preserve Bulgarian language and culture for 500 years.
Just as those books were hidden deep in the heart of Bulgaria for half a century, there was an energy and creativity hidden deep in the heart of Bulgarians through all those same years. More than 100 years before the Renaissance began, Bulgarian thinkers and artists were already shaping the world.
Now the energies and creativities of the Bulgarian people have been liberated again, and from now on, you will always be masters of your destiny, neither vassals nor victims to anyone. Now you're on a road that is often hard but with a very happy destination. I believe it will lead you to prosperity, to peace, to security, to being part of a Europe that is whole and free.
Tonight I come here again to reaffirm the friendship and the partnership of the United States, our gratitude to you for being a symbol of freedom and determination. I come to offer a toast of respect and thanks.
I toast Bulgaria, its President, and its leaders for casting your lot with freedom in spite of the pain of transition, for standing strongly with humanity in reversing ethnic cleansing, in spite of the sacrifices imposed, and having the courage to follow your dreams and the vision to achieve them. May Americans and Bulgarians always be friends and partners.
Thank you.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"June 17, 1986","
President Reagan. Greetings, and welcome to the White House, if you don't feel welcome already. Tonight we mark not only the visit of a friend, but also we celebrate a nation's return to democracy. Historic events such as the rebirth of Uruguayan democracy do not just happen. They're the outcome of the hard work, courage, and commitment of extraordinary individuals. Tonight it's my honor to be hosting such an extraordinary individual, a man who shepherded his country through the rocks and crevasses of military rule and safely back to freedom.
Speaking for his fellow countrymen earlier this year, President Sanguinetti said, ""We know we want democracy; we know we want the observance of human rights; we know we want the self-determination of the people; we know we want the enforcement of the principles of international law within our America; we know we want peace."" Well, Mr. President, we share those goals, and we also know what we want: We want to be friends with those who love liberty, people like yourself and your fellow citizens of Uruguay.
As I indicated in my welcoming remarks this morning, a love of freedom is an integral part of the national identities of our two countries. One need only think back to the hero whose birthday your country celebrates this week—General Jose Artigas, a romantic and dashing figure if there ever was one. This brave man, along with his army of gauchos, fought a courageous fight for freedom and independence. Once he had won the day, unlike so many other So-called leaders throughout the world, he did not march to the capital. Instead, he lived in the countryside, content with the title, ""Protector of Free Peoples,"" which his countrymen had affectionately bestowed upon him. Mr. President, as the elected leaders of democratic governments, we, too, are the protectors of the people—not just at home, but wherever people struggle for liberty. And, if you'll pardon me for turning around a quotation from General Artigas, today, for those who live in democracy, the challenge is for us to be as brave as we are enlightened.
So, I would ask all of you to join me in a toast to a modern-day hero of freedom, President Sanguinetti, and his good lady and the people of Uruguay.
President Sanguinetti. Mr. President, dear friends, you have spoken just now of some two things which are especially dear to us Uruguayans: friendship and General Artigas. I would like to speak about both of these things because they are both related historically.
The friendship between our peoples was born during the time of Artigas' life. Artigas had only the support of the United States. He was received with very great misunderstanding all over the Americas as well as in Europe. All of his political culture and education came from here. He was a man of arms, a man of the country. The common sense of Thomas Paine had already explained to him what the ideas of freedom were. And he had taken them into his heart, and with incredible tenacity and honesty, he stuck to them throughout.
I would like to remind you that in 1815, precisely when the provinces of the River Plate region gave him the title or the name, ""Protector,"" he found himself quite alone. At that time, he was fighting not only against the Spanish Empire but also against the Portuguese, which at that time was very strong. So, the Secretary of State of President Madison, who was—of President Monroe, rather—who was James Madison, at the time, sent a mission to see General Artigas, and General Artigas asked for American support against the Portuguese. The Americans gave that support in the form of seamen from Baltimore. So, supported by these naval people from the United States, from Baltimore, Artigas broke the Portuguese blockade.
It was from then that the idea of political freedom and freedom of trade appeared in association. The next year the situation got a lot worse for Artigas, and a very interesting debate took place in the U.S. Congress. Fortunately, by that time James Monroe was President, and he was very well aware of the situation. The Secretary of State then was James Quincy Adams. And Clay, who was a bit ahead of them politically, assumed a position against Artigas. Then came a debate which would be slightly difficult to reproduce here. But I can tell you that the U.S. Congress debated this in great depth and, in the final analysis, the position of Monroe and John Quincy Adams prevailed. And there it was said that General Artigas was the only real democrat of the River Plate provinces. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, the phrase was, ""This brave and chivalrous Republican.""
We could continue talking about this longer, but I would just recall that in 1820, the star over Artigas set, and he was defeated. Abandoned then, he chose the road of exile. And he received then a letter from James Monroe which, fortunately, still survives. In this letter, Monroe offered asylum in the United States. This letter said that not only would he be allowed to lead a peaceful life here, but that he would be given also a stipend or a pension in keeping with his condition in life and his rank. At the very saddest moment in his life, the only voice he had nearby was that one. And that man, who was defeated militarily, triumphed spiritually because he created a country with an idea, an ideal, and that ideal was the ideal of freedom.
So you see, Mr. President, how old are the ties which bind us in this friendship. A century and a half have passed. Our nations have prospered, have grown, and have had their history. The important thing is that we continue inspired by the same banner, the same flag—the flag of freedom. I would like to propose a toast that that flag of friendship and of freedom never be struck down. So, together with your wife and you and all our friends here present, I would like to propose a toast to that old friendship, which is always renewed.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"February 23, 2000","
Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome His Majesty King Juan Carlos and Majesty Queen Sofia; members of the Spanish delegation; to all the rest of you. It is a great honor in this house of the American people to welcome a King and Queen who are truly of their people.
Your Majesties, on behalf of all Americans, let me begin by expressing my condolences to the families of the two victims of yesterday's car bombing in northern Spain. We stand with Spain in condemning this cowardly act and call on those responsible to renounce the violence and terrorism which have taken too many innocent lives in recent years. In a democracy, we must settle our differences through dialog, not destruction.
One of the greatest pleasures of the last 7 years has been the opportunity that Hillary and I have had on many occasions to be with King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia. Five years ago, I welcomed them to the White House on the occasion of their son's graduation from my alma mater, the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. On that day, the King and Queen also received honorary doctorates.
The King joked that day that the reason the university had given him the degree was that if his son started bragging about his masters, he could always say, ""Yes, but I am a doctor."" [Laughter]
Two years later, the King and Queen hosted Hillary, Chelsea, and me just a few weeks after Chelsea graduated from high school. For me, it was the fulfillment of a long dream. When I was a young graduate student, more than 30 years ago, I first went to Spain in the spring of 1969. I went to Granada to visit the Alhambra. I never got over it, and I promised myself that one day, somehow, I would return. Well, thanks to the King and Queen, I was once again able to see the Sun set over the plains of Granada, in a style slightly better than that which I enjoyed as a graduate student. [Laughter]
It is a special honor for us to have the King and the Queen here today on the anniversary of the day in which the courage of the King literally saved democracy for Spain.
Our friendship is just the latest chapter in a long history of friendship between our two nations. Five centuries ago, the vision of Queen Isabella guided sailors across vast oceans to discover a new world. The Spanish of that day left their language, their religion, and much of their culture on these shores. The State in which I was born once was part of the Spanish Empire. And I suppose, Your Majesties, I am, in a sense, one of your subjects. [Laughter]
Today, five centuries later, Christopher Columbus is the only foreign citizen America honors with a national holiday. For some time now, Spanish has been our second most spoken language, and all across America, Spanish-speaking men and women, many of whom are here tonight, enrich our Nation and our lives. Today, five centuries after Spain helped to lead the world through the age of exploration, it is the vision of a direct descendant of Queen Isabella, His Majesty King Juan Carlos, who is helping to lead this new world through a new age of information.
Spain is spreading the values of democracy, respect for human rights, and free markets across the globe, from Latin America to the Balkans, Europe to the Middle East. Your Majesties, we are proud in America to be your partners, your allies, and your friends.
Saint Isidore once wrote, ""Spain is the most beautiful of all the lands extending from the West to India, for through her, East and West receive light."" Today, may the light of our friendship continue to inspire and enlighten nations from East to West as we work to build a world that is more democratic, more open, more free, and at peace.
I ask you all to join me in a toast to the King and Queen of Spain and the people of their wonderful country.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"November 17, 1981","
President Reagan. President Herrera, Mrs. Herrera, distinguished guests, and friends:
President Herrera once said, ""History shows that only those human actions which are based on ethical principles have a truly lasting significance."" Tonight, we honor a man and a country that has chosen a path of principle, one that will have lasting significance.
Democracy and respect for human rights is not the easiest course, but it is the most moral. President Herrera, a man of deep religious and moral convictions, long ago decided to stand for what is right. As a boy, he witnessed a chain gang composed of political prisoners. This sight frightened lesser men; it instead strengthened Herrera Campins' resolve to fight dictatorship. Later this love of freedom led to his own arrest and exile, yet he stood firm with the other brave individuals and, eventually, they and the principles of human freedom triumphed.
Such dedication is deeply admired here, but politics is not the only way to catch a glimpse of one's soul. Now, to many Americans, Venezuela has come to mean excellence in sports. David Concepeion and Tony Armas and many other fine baseball players have come to us from Venezuela. And interestingly, President Herrera and I both were sports journalists at one time.
In welcoming President Herrera to Washington, I recalled the portion of his magnificent statement to the United Nations. What I didn't mention was that after delivering it, he went to Yankee Stadium to see a ballgame. [Laughter]
Now, Mr. President, you probably don't know that your dinner partner tonight, my wife, Nancy—her birthday is July 6th, but her mother has told me it would have been July 4th, except she didn't want to miss the doubleheader at Yankee Stadium. [Laughter]
Mr. President, you're a man, and Venezuelans are a people, whose love of life and of freedom are something with which the people of the United States can identify. You and your country stand for those values and those principles that reflect the best of mankind. You honor us by this visit, and Venezuela honors us by its friendship.
Now, I ask all of you to join with me in a toast to President Herrera Campins, his lovely wife, and to the people of Venezuela. May our bonds be always so strong.
President Herrera. Your Excellency, Mr. President of the United States, Mrs. Reagan, distinguished guests:
Mr. President, thank you for such a pleasant dinner, for your kind words, and the friendship and cordiality extended to us during this visit to the United States.
The ideals of liberty, human respect, and democratic government inspire our two countries. These principles are the fundamental basis of the good relations between Venezuela and the United States: mutual respect, the desire to understand each other's realities, and the conviction that dialog and negotiation enable us to overcome differences when inspired by a sincere willingness to achieve understanding.
We shall soon commemorate 250 years of George Washington's birth and, in 1983, the bicentennial of the birth of our liberator, Simon Bolivar. In the example of these two great men, we can and must seek and find the common source of our ideals of liberty and human dignity, those profound roots of friendship and cooperation between our two countries.
Allow me, Mr. President, to recall that in May of 1781, Francisco de Miranda, forerunner of Latin American independence, fought in Pensacola the battle that paved the way for Cornwallis' surrender in Yorktown. Between the 18th and the 19th centuries, the first Venezuelan cosmovisionary, Miranda, acted thus on all the great stages where freedom of man was at stake: the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Latin American Revolution-three related political processes of undeniable projection to the rest of the world.
It was thus on North American soil that Miranda began his journey to freedom. After Pensacola he would later say, ""My first thought as a man was a feeling of national fervor. When participating in the emancipation of the United States, the first surge of my spirit was a yearning for the liberation of the places which saw me, coming to the world, for I did not dare to call America a homeland. This feeling of love for liberty acted so much upon me that ever since all my thoughts referred to it, and it became the motive for all my actions and the reason for all my journeys.""
We are faithful to the Bolivarian teachings on the achievement of continental integration in a world of peace. Latin America is a region that feels a natural calling to multilateral relations. The Organization of American States, CARICOME, the subregional Andean Pact, the Amazonian Pact, the Latin American Organization for Energy, the Latin American Economic System, the Central American Common Market, the Latin American Integration Association are but part of those multilateral organizations where Latin American plurality is of the continental scope.
Multilaterality is both our inclination and our strength, notwithstanding the importance of bilateral ties which in no way deny and basically reinforce multilateral relations. More and more do we strive for oneness in a united comprehension of our diversities, so we will not go separate and divided, drifted by discord, disparity, and anarchy.
We wish to achieve a comprehensive, harmonious development. There are still many needs to be provided for, much want to be met, and social injustice to be redressed. The evils of underdevelopment resist all efforts to dislodge them and strike root by singular lack of understanding. The path that is to guide us at a lower social cost towards the future is that of cooperation based on solidarity.
Such a cooperation must range from the cultural to the economic. We aspire not only to a numerical increase of per capita income, but also to a fair distribution of wealth so that well-being and prosperity can be placed at everyone's reach and the population be guaranteed an access to the goods basic to human dignity. This must be the result of a joint effort, that of the government and that of the people. Education and work are the tools of progress and self-improvement. Personal, individual, and combined efforts must be encouraged. We believe in the promoting role of the state, a promoter state that fosters individual and social initiatives, yet does not waive its social function of intervention, regulation, and control.
We believe in foreign investments to be measured according to national convenience when they constitute financial injections and not simple patent permits that will absorb national savings and derive from them their profits without incurring the risk of investing their own capital. We act in this respect within the framework of Decision 24 of the Andean Pact because we wish to strengthen our own sources of financing.
We know that in many cases foreign capital, without losing sight of its profit-making goals, attempts to create wealth and employment in our countries. If it comes to us with that purpose, we welcome it. However, we have suffered exploitation and exaction from transnational companies whose doubtful procedures and excessive pursuit of profit forced the United States to legislate against monopolies.
We desire as much as you do a democratic Latin America—peace loving and respectful of human rights. Liberty must be supported on social justice if it wants to overcome critical poverty, disease, lack of culture, and backwardness. It is on the basis of nonintervention and respect for free self-determination of nations that we shall be able to achieve collective security and protect our region from the great world tensions where threatening language can trigger conflicts capable of destroying peace.
We are committed to democracy. Neither the traditional dictatorships nor the new leftist totalitarianisms represent valid solutions to nations whose vocation is liberty. In this line of conduct, we give active political and moral support to the government junta of El Salvador, presided by our distinguished friend Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is trying to offer a democratic and institutional way out of the situation of violence and terrorism existing in his country.
We have stretched out a hand to Nicaragua, as Latin America awaits its conversion to democracy after it supported its struggle against a dynastic dictatorship. As long as there remains any rational hope for a pluralistic society to be achieved there, we shall maintain our attitude of cooperation.
We are aware of the existence of destabilizing tensions and predications in the Caribbean, but we must weigh wisely our actions there so as to prevent conflicts from expanding and endangering world peace. We oppose any kind of foreign intervention and reject all provocative action taken by underpowers that act as mandataries in the Central American region and in the Caribbean.
The summit conference of Cancun took place a few weeks ago, and we had there the opportunity to exchange views on the international situation. You were witness to the seriousness, the dignity, and independence of Venezuela's position as stated in my speeches.
We did our best so that this unique, historical, momentous dialog between industrialized countries and developing nations would not end in failure. We all made a joint effort to avoid confrontation and seek foremost the positive coincidences that would lead to the necessary cooperation. The step taken was yet a modest one, but it brought out the political will of the 22 attending chiefs of state and government to pursue global negotiations within the framework of the United Nations.
Upon your return from Mexico you said that the efforts and constructive spirit which characterized the discussions at Cancun must continue. And the American Ambassador to the United Nations declared recently that every one of us bears the responsibility for transplanting the spirit of Cancun to all the forums of the United Nations system. This time we cannot fail. These words bring optimism to the developing world, which trusts the understanding and the good disposition of the United States.
Mr. President, Venezuela projects democracy and freedom in its foreign policy and has made its energetic wealth act as a concrete instrument of negotiation, cooperation, and international solidarity. A great many coincidences with the United States enable us to march side by side on the road of human freedom.
In your two speeches today, Mr. President, you referred first to Venezuelans such as Simon Bolivar, and in your speech tonight to young compatriots of mine who are in this world of sports, who, at a time not too far away nor too near this day, were people that were of interest to you and me when we were sports journalists.
You have called our compatriots, David Concepcion and Tony Armas, who today are excellent players in the big leagues. And if you allow me this association of ideas, perhaps you might have believed in the talks I had today with you and with high representatives of your government that my position as was stated on Central America and the Caribbean is too optimistic. But I am an optimist, and I believe you are one, too.
When you were a candidate for the Presidency, on our television we saw many of the films in which you acted years ago, and I remember one very specially which is related to baseball.
You were playing the role of a pitcher, a great pitcher, who suddenly felt, let's say, a drop in his physical conditions, and it was the trust of his friends and his moral conviction that he had to play to have his team win that made the team win.
And I am sure that your quarry of optimism has not run dry. And although perhaps the situation might seem sometimes dramatic, we can be certain that it is people—men and people like those of the United States and Venezuela who love freedom-those are the ones that will win.
To reiterate, allow me to reiterate my gratitude and that of Betty and the persons who accompany me for all your kindness, and as I do so, I raise my glass in a toast to your personal happiness, that of your distinguished wife, to the democratic success of your government, and the prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States, a people forever committed to liberty.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"March 18, 1986","
The President. Did you think I'd never get here? [Laughter] Well, Prime Minister and Mrs. Mulroney—Brian and Mila—distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure to welcome you to the White House. A year ago almost to the day, I celebrated one of the most enjoyable St. Patrick's Days in my memory, and I can assure you that my memory goes back a long way. [Laughter] And the recollection of that beautiful day at Quebec City is not the only thing that Brian Mulroney and I have to commemorate in connection with his visit to Washington this time. In just 2 days, if my calculations are correct, Brian will be 47 years old. And, kid, I wish you the very best. [Laughter] You know, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm beginning to notice that every time they bring out my birthday cake, the top of it's beginning to look more and more like a torchlight parade— [laughter] —and I have a feeling that I'll be signing a disaster proclamation the next day. [Laughter] But seriously, though, Mr. Prime Minister, we wish you a very happy birthday, and we're so pleased to have you and Mila with us this evening.
I enjoyed our discussions today. I worked with Canadians long before I ran for public office. The contributions Canadians have been making on our way of life and every profession is incalculable. The bond of affection between us is truly a treasure. We drew upon those historic bonds, Mr. Prime Minister, when last year at Quebec we laid the foundation for what I call the new partnership. We've continued today, fully recognizing that the long-term stakes are high. We can work together to resolve the issue of acid rain, as we've worked together to resolve so many environmental issues before. We can ensure that our joint defense remains so strong that no aggressor will ever attack us. And we can reach a new agreement on trade that would help us achieve unparalleled prosperity for our citizens.
I strongly endorse a prompt start to formal negotiations in the fullest possible scope to those talks. Before I leave the White House, Mr. Prime Minister, I hope that we can bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. We can lead our people into the light of prosperity, freedom, and good will. Nothing less, of course, should be expected of two free peoples who live so close. Freedom is the fountainhead from which mutual respect and amicability flow. And freedom is what America-Canada and the United States—is all about.
A story that reflects this love of freedom concerns a young man, John Magee, whose father was rector of St. John's Church, which is right across Lafayette Square from the White House here. In 1940, in the dark days of the Second World War—the United States was still not in the fight—Canada, responding to the pull of ancient loyalties, had joined the struggle the year before. So, like thousands of others, John Magee crossed the border to join up. He became Pilot Officer Magee of the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1941 his squadron was sent to fight in the Battle of Britain. A few days after his arrival in England, he sent a letter back home. ""I am enclosing,"" he said, ""a verse I wrote the other day. It started at 30,000 feet and was finished soon after I landed."" But on December 11, 1941, Pilot Officer Magee was killed at age 19. He had lived just long enough to see his own country join the struggle at the side of his foster land.
Well, that verse he sent back is called ""High Flight."" And the day we lost the valiant seven of the space shuttle Challenger, it came instantly to my mind: ""Oh, how I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth, put out my hand, and touched the face of God."" ""High Flight"" was a beloved favorite of the Royal Canadian Air Force, whose motto was ""Through Perseverance We Reach the Stars."" As a matter of fact, it was adopted by our own Air Force, and it was—I don't believe there's an Air Force installation in this country that did not have someplace-displayed his poem. It resonates in the hearts of all who cherish the twin values of faith and freedom. And it resonates in the hearts of North Americans. And so, we remember Pilot Officer John Magee—American poet, Canadian pilot, North American hero.
So, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a threefold toast to Her Majesty the Queen of Canada, to my good friend Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to his lovely wife, and to the enduring bond between our two North American peoples.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President and Nancy, chers amies Americains, etchers constitues h Canadiens—I learned that from President Reagan last year. [Laughter] Make a fine candidate—Canada. [Laughter] It is with a particular mix of pleasure and pride that Mila and I have come to this great capital and to this celebrated house; pleasure at being among such friends again, particularly Ron and Nancy Reagan—to find you looking, as is said, Mr. President, in French—dangereusement bien—so dangerously well— [laughter] —I'll mention that to Tip tomorrow— [laughter] —and pride in the occasion to renew and toast the friendship between our two countries, our two peoples, and if I may say so, ourselves as good friends. I hope that my brief reference in French will not lead to the suspicion that I am attempting to capitalize on the well-known regard which Americans have had for the French since Lafayette took his position beside George Washington in the Revolution.
I suppose, Mr. President, that Canadians most admire, of all things, your uncanny ability to forecast the future. When you became aware what television was going to do to the movies, you decided to try something easy— [laughter] —you chose politics, and we're glad that you did. Nearly two centuries ago, when John Adams took up residence in what was then known as the ""President's House,"" he composed a prayer that is today carved in the mantle of this residence: ""May none but honest and wise men,"" he concluded, ""ever rule under this roof."" We feel not only among friends but, in a very real sense, among family.
In 1939 Winston Churchill said of our two countries: ""That long frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world."" For just as we share a continent, just as we have jointly inherited our precious environment, we are bound up inevitably in one another's economic interests. I speak, of course, Mr. President, in response to your observation of the trading relationship between our two countries, a relationship already uniquely important in the affairs of the world.
I speak also of a new challenge—further trade liberalization between us. On October 1 last, I advised the President of the Canadian desire to pursue a new trade agreement with the United States. On the following day, Mr. President, you welcomed the Canadian initiative. In these first days of October I think that we issued to our respective countries an historic challenge, one of historic proportions, by expressing the wish to enter into negotiations. I, for my part, was responding to some questions that are asked at home. Are we in Canada confident enough in our ability to maintain our political sovereignty in a process that will lead to closer relations? And the answer is yes. Have we in Canada a cultural identity strong enough to live and grow in this process? And the answer is yes. And have we in Canada developed the economic and commercial enterprises necessary to prosper under greater competition? And the answer, again, is emphatically yes.
I think, Mr. President, the challenge for your country may well be to show understanding of our concerns as we shall for yours. With you as our only immediate neighbor, we have developed as a distinct nation. Let's continue to grow stronger, each in our own ways. Let's continue to reinforce one another by exchanging what we produce that is best. This was the key to our success in the past and this, I think, is the promise of our future. Because if we have the wisdom and forbearance to succeed, then the whole world will be the beneficiary, just as Churchill foresaw.
A half-century ago Canada and the United States blazed a new trail towards lower tariffs and quotas—the world was very different then. But the imperatives of liberalization are more compelling than ever in our increasingly interdependent economies. Neither of our countries was built by the fainthearted. We've already achieved much together, from commerce to communications, from sea to space, in joint ventures based on mutual interest and mutual respect. Earlier today I had the pleasure of informing the President that Canada has accepted his invitation to join in the manned space station project. This venture symbolizes our joint confidence in the future, our commitment to shared technology, and Canada's pride in joining you in the exploration of space.
I know Ronald Reagan to be a man of warmth and wisdom, of grace and good will. We, in Canada, know we have a true and valued friend in President Reagan. Friends may sometimes disagree, friends may diverge in opinion, friends speak frankly, but they give each other the benefit of the doubt. There can be no doubt, however, about our common commitment to freedom, Mr. President, and our common commitment to peace. We concur wholeheartedly with your view that not only is nuclear war unwinnable, it must never be fought.
Canadians, no less than Americans, were deeply relieved when the President of the United States met last fall with a leader of the Soviet Union. In honest dialog there is a beginning of understanding. You, Mr. President, have broken new ground in your offer to the Soviet Union last week to exchange information and technologies with the Soviets for verifying limits on nuclear testing. We remain confident that the spirit of Geneva will carry over into your next meeting with Mr. Gorbachev and your visit to the Soviet Union. The hopes of the world ride on the outcome of your discussions with Secretary Gorbachev. Our prayers and our support go with you. Mr. President, your entire career has been a testament to courage and conviction, to your desire to do the right thing for America and for the world. That determination will prevail in your pursuit of world peace.
At this time, colleagues and friends, I am privileged, honored, to propose a toast to a friend—and a very distinguished friend of Canada. Ladies and gentlemen, for Nancy and for the President of the United States of America.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"October 04, 1983","
President Reagan. Well, Mr. President and Mrs. Carstens, Mr. Minister and Mrs. Genscher, honored guests:
I said this morning, and I would like to say it again, how happy and proud that Nancy and I are to welcome you to the United States. Your own ties with our country, including a master of laws degree from Yale University, are longstanding and deep. Your life is a monument to the shared values and interests that have long provided our two peoples with a bounty of good will. And today, all Americans celebrate our ties and are grateful for our solid friendship with the German people.
Three hundred years ago, a small group of hardy pioneers set out from Krefeld, in the Rhineland, to sail into the unknown. In America they found the religious freedom they sought, but hard work was the price they paid for their new-found freedom. And those 13 German families brought with them courage and industry to build new lives. Their talents and those of their descendants helped create the great city of Philadelphia and the great State of Pennsylvania, both of which share our honor in welcoming you.
This year we commemorate the remarkable odyssey of the Krefelders and of the millions of others who followed them. The virtues of courage, industry, and belief in freedom which they brought helped build our country, contributing to what is best about the United States. The contributions of German Americans have been invaluable to the development of our great country.
The people of the Federal Republic of Germany have proven that they still possess those traits that helped build America. From the rubble of the Second World War the industrious German people constructed a strong, healthy, and free democracy. We stand firmly together in the search for peace and freedom.
Anniversary celebrations tend to look back, but we should not limit our commemoration to reminiscences of the past. A strength of both of our peoples is that we also look to the future. The true meaning of this anniversary week is an enduring partnership that will lead to a more secure peace in the decades ahead.
Many colorful events have been organized throughout the United States to celebrate our ties. I congratulate the sponsors of these undertakings and of the numerous initiatives which have sprung up during this tricentennial year. The tricentennial reinvigorates the cultural, historical, and political ties between our two peoples. It symbolizes something real, tangible, and enduring-German-American friendship.
Mr. President, we're grateful for your visit. We thank you for all that you've personally done in your distinguished career to support close ties between our two nations. And I want to tell you, knowing your background here in America, when I was a boy I read about Frank Merriwell at Yale; I didn't read Brown of Harvard. [Laughter]
We raise our glasses to you, Mr. President. To President Carstens and to the friendship that your visit represents.
President Carstens. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen:
It gives me great pleasure, Mr. President, to be your guest here in the White House. And I thank you most cordially, also, in the name of my wife and in the name of the Vice Chancellor, Foreign Minister and Mrs. Genscher, and of our other German guests, for the warm and generous hospitality which you are again extending to us.
I am deeply moved that it has been granted to me, as representative of the German people, to visit the United States and to strengthen the bonds of friendship with your great country. I look forward with eager expectation to the days in Philadelphia, St. Louis, Dallas, Seattle, Madison, New York, and New Haven.
Let us, Germans and Americans, bear in mind our common history, and let us take strength from our common ideals and our common goals. On this visit, personal memories shall be accompanying me. I have been to the United States on numerous occasions in an official capacity. However, my thoughts go back, above all, to the time immediately after the Second World War when I obtained a scholarship from Yale University in 1948.
The year which I spent there added a new dimension to my life. The good will and the cordiality which I encountered are firmly engraved in my memory. At Yale I studied American constitutional law, and I later qualified as a university professor in Germany with a study on this subject. This aroused my interest in public affairs and in politics. I felt more and more called upon to work for the common good.
And it also became clear to me at Yale as to what constitutes the real strengths of the American nation; namely, the conviction of its citizens that there are basic values which precede every and any governmental system. Among these values rank the dignity of man, justice, and freedom, and also something which you, Mr. President, have repeatedly stressed; namely, trust in God. This has been true from the beginning, and the tricentennial of the first German immigration into North America marks an appropriate moment for recalling it.
""Proclaim freedom throughout the land, for all its citizens."" These words, from the book of Leviticus, are inscribed on the Freedom Bell in Philadelphia. In the first place, they refer to religious freedom. But they also included the other human rights, the inalienable rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as the Declaration of Independence expresses them. In these ideals, and in the earnest endeavors to realize them, lay the great attraction of the United States from the very beginning. Millions of Germans felt this attraction and went to America, and they included many of our nation's best sons and daughters-freedom-loving, industrious, adventurous men and women who found a new home here.
They became pioneers in building your country, and they tied the cordial bonds of attachment between America and Germany which have proved their constancy despite several setbacks. Germans played, as you have mentioned, Mr. President, a role in the advance of American civilization and the natural science, the social sciences, the fine arts and music, a civilization which has entered upon an unparalleled, victorious march through the whole world in our epoch and which has profoundly influenced the lifestyle of almost all countries, including ours.
But the United States did not only lay a new foundation for the social life within their own country but also towards other countries. ""Observe good faith and justice towards all nations,"" declared George Washington in his farewell address. ""Cultivate peace and harmony with all to give to mankind the magnanimous and noble example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence.""
Clearly it is difficult always to comply with such a high claim. However, the benevolence and magnanimity remained guiding principles for American policy. And we Germans also experienced the charitable assistance of the Americans after the Second World War. The granting of economic aid in the shape of the Marshall plan furnish examples of this, as does the airlift to Berlin, a city which owes so much to America and which you visited last June—June of last year—Mr. President.
Safeguarding freedom in Europe—that is the purpose of the North Atlantic alliance in which our two countries are partners. This alliance is a defense community. And I need not stress that it only serves to defend. It is an alliance between free peoples who have joined together because they share the same values, including freedom, which they wish to preserve.
This alliance has granted us security and peace over three decades. During this time, about 9 million American citizens served as soldiers in Germany. Together with our young German conscripts and troops from other member countries of the alliance, they ensured that we can live in the manner desired by the overwhelming majority of our citizens; namely, in a free democracy governed by the rule of law.
Germany is a divided country; yet we Germans adhere to the unity of our people. The policy pursued by the Federal Republic of Germany is directed towards a state of peace in Europe in which the German people will regain their unity through free self-determination. We thank America for always supporting this goal of ours.
As I said, for about 30 years the United States and Germany are members of the alliance. And if the alliance endeavors to obtain a military equilibrium at as low a level as possible, this will guarantee not only freedom but also peace. Both of these, freedom and peace, would be endangered, I think, if the other side were to acquire military superiority. The fate of Afghanistan provides a sad example. We must never tire of pointing out these implications time and again to those among our citizens who champion the cause of unilateral disarmament, even though I respect their motives.
We Germans shall stand by your side as your allies and partners also in the future. And with this thought in mind, may I now raise my glass to drink to your health and success. Mr. President, to your health, Mrs. Reagan, to a happy future for the United States of America, the leading power of the free nations, and to another three centuries of German-American friendship.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"April 16, 2009","
Good evening. Thank you very much. Let me begin by expressing my deepest thanks to President Calderon and Mrs. Zavala for their gracious welcome, and thank you for the spectacular setting. I can't imagine a more magnificent evening. This is my first trip as President to Mexico, and it's one that I will always remember fondly for the hospitality and the warmth that has been provided to me during my brief visit.
Now, earlier today we conducted a series of productive meetings on a whole host of challenges and opportunities that we face jointly. We spoke about our deep economic ties, reflecting the $1 billion of trade that crosses our borders every day. And we discussed steps that we can take together, both bilaterally and in a global setting, to advance opportunity and prosperity in our two countries and across the Americas.
We spoke about the deep ties between our peoples, and what steps can be made to meet our immigration challenge. That involves passing comprehensive immigration reform in the United States, which I am committed to doing, and it involves making certain that we are promoting increased opportunity here in Mexico.
We spoke about our obligation to take steps to build clean energy together that can power our economies and beat back climate change in future centuries. And of course, we spoke about the grave dangers that the drug cartels are presenting to both our nations, that are threatening innocent men and women and children on both sides of our borders, and our shared determination to put an end to these drug wars.
These are some of the critical challenges that we face as a result of a border we share. But what makes us good neighbors is not that our interests are always aligned, that we will agree on everything. In our long and interwoven history, we haven't always been on the same side of every issue, and there is no doubt that in the future there will be differences once again. What makes us good neighbors is a simple truth that our people share so much more than common challenges and common interests. We also share values and ideals. We are both a people who know the meaning of hard work, a people who know what it means to struggle and to sacrifice on behalf of our children and our grandchildren, people who know that strength comes from faith and from family, people who have known hardship and trial and persevered in the face of great odds.
That's the story of the separate struggles for independence that have made our nations who we are, struggles that are forged on this continent, two adjoining nations founded on a set of shared values that our democracy is not simply a gift from a previous generation, but a responsibility for each generation to protect and to pass on to the next. We both understand that no one, whether through influence of politics, the power of money, or the fear of force, is above the law, and that we are--every one of us--equal, endowed with the basic human rights that spring not from our laws but from our Maker.
Each of our nations was formed out of this sense that a state has no greater responsibility than to uphold the essential dignity of its citizens. That was the promise of my country's struggle for independence. That was the promise of Mexico's struggle for independence. That was the promise of American independence. It's a promise advanced by Hidalgo as well as Washington, by Lincoln but also by Juarez, and a promise that now falls on all of us to advance in our own time.
More than 60 years ago, at a moment when our world was consumed with war, one of my predecessors came here to Mexico to reaffirm the relationship between our two nations. In a speech to the people of Mexico, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said: ""[Our] peoples are finding that they have common aspirations. They can work together for a common objective. Let us never lose hold of that truth.""
That was President Roosevelt's message then; that is my message now. And I'm confident that if we continue to draw strength from our common aspirations and purpose from our common objectives, if we continue to act, as we have during this visit, in a spirit of mutual responsibility, mutual respect, and mutual interest, then that is a truth that we will uphold together in the months and years to come.
And I am so pleased that I have such an outstanding partner as President Calderon, somebody who has shown his courage and his bravery, and somebody who's shown that he combines a sense of principle with a sense of practicality; somebody who I know wants to be a partner with me as we strengthen our partnership and we make certain that the children of Mexico and the children of the United States are both seeing a future that's more prosperous and more hopeful than the ones that have come before.
So thank you very much, everybody. And let me please make a toast to my host.

President Eanes, Mrs. Eanes, ladies and gentlemen, in 1983 Nancy and I welcomed President and Mrs. Eanes, as you've been told, to the White House on a state visit. And while in Washington, the Eanes's told us a great deal about the history of Portugal. Last month, Mrs. Eanes returned to the White House to attend a conference of First Ladies that Nancy had organized, and once again we heard about the glories of Portugal-the magnificent climate, the alluring beauty of your coast, the splendor of your architecture, and most important the renowned friendliness and energetic talent of the Portuguese people. Well, that did it, and here we are.
Mr. President and Mrs. Eanes, it is an honor for us to join you. For your warmth, your kindness, and your hospitality we thank you from our hearts. We're delighted to be here in one of the oldest states in Europe, a country that traces her independence to 1140 and her present-day boundaries to 1249. As you noted in Washington, Mr. President, during her eight centuries of independence, Portugal has been a major participant in the long and complex effort that created the Europe that we know today.
Still more significant, Portugal contributed to our conception of the world itself. It was your country, smaller than many others and situated on the extreme western edge of the continent, that became a keystone by which Europe was joined with Africa, Asia, and America, integrating for the first time the four corners of the Earth.
Young students in America, and I would imagine in all lands, will forever be fascinated by the dreams and skill and courage of the Portuguese, who gave the world some of the greatest adventures in human history. Portuguese ships reaching the Canary Islands as early as 1337; then, supported by Prince Henry the Navigator and John II, exploring further to the Congo, southern Africa, and around the Cape of Good Hope; and in 1499, Vasco da Gama's miraculous return from India, an epic event that stirred all Europe and formed the basis for one of the great literary works of Western civilization, the poem ""The Lusiadas.""
By the early 1500's your flag was flying in the Americas, and by 1542 Joao Cabrilho discovered California, and that happens to be one discovery, if I may say so, for which Nancy and I will always be particularly grateful.
In these years man's sense of the possible was expanded. The unknown world yielded to reason and daring. The known world was celebrated and adorned. It was a time of intellectual and cultural excitement, a time when the Portuguese were reaching for the new and the unexplored and when the greatness of the human spirit was given expression in greatness of deed and art.
Today, Mr. President, we who have studied and been so stirred by the feats of Portugal's past, see your nation setting off on am ambitious new voyage into the future. Your democracy is just a decade old. Already, it has been threatened, but you overcame those threats. You've suffered economic disruptions and slow growth, but you're facing these problems forthrightly, and I believe you will overcome them as well. In doing so you bring honor to democratic ideals; and you are, once again, expanding the limits of the possible. Portuguese democracy is no longer a risky experiment but a solidly established fact. The spirit of daring is thriving again.
Mr. President, your personal leadership in helping to shepherd the Portuguese renewal has been strong, constant, and decisive. You have defended democratic freedoms and civil liberties. You have become a symbol of your country's commitment to liberty, helping Portugal herself become an example for all the world, showing those who still thirst for freedom that totalitarianism can be rebuffed and representative government established in its place. And for all this, Mr. President, we heartily salute you.
I'm pleased that since our last meeting our two nations have strengthened the bonds that unite us. We have completed agreements on military assistance and cooperation. Portugal has created the Luso-American Foundation, which will prove an important instrument for cooperation in economic, technical, and other spheres. American banks have placed branches here in Lisbon, and recently a delegation of American business leaders visited Portugal to consider further investments in this country and joint undertakings with Portuguese enterprises. American business leaders know that Portugal now offers freedom and stability in economic life; these are precious seeds of opportunity that can blossom into great enterprises yielding greater abundance for tomorrow.
The friendship and trust between Portugal and the United States runs deep. We serve proudly together as members of the NATO alliance, defending the West. We consult widely on other foreign policy' matters, and we in the United States value the perspective that your long involvement with Africa has given you on that continent.
I believe that the stars of our progress are bright. And as travel between our countries increases and Portugal takes up its membership in the European Community—an important step for Portugal and all of Europe—they will shine brighter still. We look forward to the work that Portugal and the United States will do together—improving the lives of our people, defending the free world, and by our example extending comfort to the downtrodden and hope to the oppressed everywhere.
At the close of the ""The Lusiadas,"" the poet addresses King Sebastiao and, in a wider sense, Portugal herself. He speaks of the John I and Pedro the Just, two of Portugal's monarchs on the eve of the Age of Discovery:
Yet thou, Sebastiao, thou, my king, attend;Behold what glories on thy throne descend!Oh, be it thine these glories to renew, And John's bold path and Pedro's course pursue.
Mr. President, it is in our own time that Portugal is truly taking up the poet's challenge. Today the ancient glories are being renewed in freedom, and the bold path has a very special name—democracia.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to you, Mr. President, to Portugal, and to the success of Portugal's future of freedom, democracy, and peace.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"February 26, 1981","
The President. Prime Minister Thatcher, Nancy and I welcome you, Mr. Thatcher, and your daughter, Carol, to this house, and it's my deep hope that as the leaders of two nations whose relationship is vital for the preservation of human freedom that we'll be in close and frequent consultation in the years ahead. Absolute trust between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States will continue to be the hallmark of Anglo-American cooperation.
Roosevelt and Churchill, Attlee and Truman, Eisenhower and Macmillan—these names inseparably linked in recent history-the legacy of their relationships is nothing less than the security and the freedom enjoyed by our nations today. We will continue in this great tradition, not only because it's essential but also because our two peoples expect and insist on it.
Our joint love of liberty was spawned by a common heritage. It was English history and tradition, with the Magna Carta and the Common Law, which gave birth to our Declaration of Independence. It was men of enormous intellectual capacity and courage-John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and John Stuart Mill—whose powerful ideas fed our notions of individual freedom and the dignity of all people.
In her London address last month to the Pilgrim Club the Prime Minister affirmed that her own political convictions are founded in that love of freedom, that rejection of tyranny and repression which inspired the Pilgrim Fathers and those who followed them to America. Well, it's widely known that I share many of your ideals and beliefs, Prime Minister Thatcher. My admiration for you was reinforced during today's productive meeting. I believe, however, that our relationship goes beyond cordiality and shared ideals. In these days the survival of our nations and the peace of the world are threatened by forces which are willing to exert any pressure, test any will, and destroy any freedom.
Survival in this era requires us, as those who preceded us, to take freedom in the palm of our hands and never to cower behind a veil of unrealistic optimism. We shall learn from those who spoke of the need for vigilance, even when speaking out was not popular. Winston Churchill was such a man, a man more than any other who symbolizes the link between our two nations. He was the son of Britain, but the child of a New World woman. His dedication to principle was not without hardship, yet his courage never wavered. We, undeniably, are the beneficiaries of the freedom he loved and the peace that he sought.
He had two nations in his soul, but he touched all nations with his spirit. But today peace, Churchill's peace, is in danger. It may serve us to look to the wisdom of his words. He said, and I shall quote him, ""The peace will not be preserved without the virtues that make victory possible in war. Peace will not be preserved by pious sentiments expressed in terms of platitudes or by official grimaces and diplomatic correctitude, however desirable these may be from time to time. It will not be preserved by casting aside in dangerous years the panoply of warlike strength. There must be earnest thought; there must also be faithful perseverance and foresight. Great Heart must have his sword and armor to guard the pilgrims on their way. Above all, among the English-speaking peoples there must be the union of hearts based upon conviction and common ideals.""
After our discussions today I'm confident that we too will be as Great Heart and guard the world's pilgrims on their way. Together we'll strive to preserve the liberty and peace so cherished by our peoples. No foe of freedom should doubt our resolve. We will prevail, because our faith is strong and our cause is just. And the same Winston Churchill that I quoted with that lovely passage also had the wit and humor that in Canada in the dark days of World War II he could call attention to the fact that the enemy had threatened to wring the neck of the United Kingdom. And after the Battle of Britain, as he was speaking, who will ever forget him leaning over that podium and saying, ""Some chicken. Some neck."" [Laughter]
I ask you now to honor our most welcome guest this evening and and her country by joining me in a toast to Her Majesty, the Queen. The Queen.
You are very welcome here. We're delighted that you'd come.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
May I first thank you, Mr. President, for your wonderful hospitality this evening, for this remarkably beautiful banquet, and for the lovely music which you arranged for our delight.
I thought as I heard that song ""I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places,"" this is quite a nice, old familiar place in which to see you, Mr. President. [Laughter] And I hope we'll be able to sing that song for very, very many years. And what was the other? ""There'll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover tomorrow when the dawn is free."" Well, the dawn is free now. And you and I have to try to make something of it which would match the hopes of :,hose who made it free.
We started this momentous day on your lawn, Mr. President, in weather that, when it occurs for some public occasion with us, we describe as royal weather. And it's a great pleasure to end the day in your house at this glittering dinner party as guests of you and Mrs. Reagan. We've heard so much of your oratory as a speaker, and it's been such a delight to hear you speak. And I've been very moved by what you've said.
I'm told, Mr. President, that when you and Mrs. Reagan were inspecting your new home, where we're dining this evening, to see what refurbishment was needed, you came across some charred areas, vestiges of certain heated events in 1812. [Laughter] I don't think I need apologize for them, because I'm relieved to hear that Mrs. Reagan saw in this not a source of historical reproach, but an opportunity for redecoration— [laughter] —and very beautiful it is.
This sense of renewal that's in the air is making itself felt far beyond this lovely house. You, Mr. President, won a massive victory in November after a marvelous campaign in which you made clear your determination to set your country on a fresh course. You underlined that determination last week in a budget speech which I very much admired and so it seemed to me did all those who heard it.
Mr. President, when you come to visit us in Britain—and I do hope it will be soon-you'll find that there's been change and renewal in the Old World too. Indeed, not long ago I was reading a book whose author had visited London shortly after the war. He wrote that ""in spite of the homesickness, the hunger and annoyance at socialist bumbling, my farewell to London held its measure of regret. There were friendships made and cherished to this day.""
Mr. President, you were that homesick and hungry author. You will remember the book which you wrote after, I think, you'd been making a film. Was it ""The Hasty Heart"" in London? Well, I doubt whether I'll be able to do much about your homesickness. You may even feel hunger if you're in search of a real American jellybean in London. [Laughter] But when you do come over, I can promise you two things. The first is the friendship of the British people, and the second, that the years of socialist bumbling are at an end.
I'm proud to lead a Conservative administration in Britain. For me, and I know for you, too, conservatism doesn't mean maintenance of the status quo. It means maintenance of the old values, the only background against which one could make the changes and adaptations which have to be made to keep abreast of the technological change that we need to embrace for a prosperous future. Conservatism means harnessing, but still more, the liberation of the fundamental strengths and resources which make a country great, which make its people prosperous and self-reliant.
As a Conservative I want determined and decisive government. But that's something very different from an all-powerful government. You and I, Mr. President, believe in strong governments in areas where only governments can do the job, areas where governments can and must be strong-strong in the defense of the nation, strong in protecting law and order, strong in promoting a sound currency. It we do these things very well, we shall indeed be leaders of strong government, doing the things that only government can do.
But for too long and in too many places we've seen government assume the role of universal provider and universal arbiter. In many areas of our daily life there are hard but essential choices to be made. But in a free society those choices ought not to be made by government, but by free men and women and managers and work force alike, whose lives and livelihood are directly affected.
Mr. President, wall-to-wall government is no substitute for that freedom of choice. Wall-to-wall government is economically inefficient and morally demeaning to the individual. Just take a look at those countries where the art has been brought to its cold, callous perfection to see where that leads.
Mr. President, in Britain's case we've set ourselves to reverse a process of industrial decline which has lasted decades. We too seek to release the real energies of the wealth-creating sector in the first place and, above all, by conquering the crippling forces of inflation. We're winning that battle. The cost is heavy, particularly in terms of the present levels of unemployment. But we won't solve that problem just by reflation, whatever the short-term attractions. The only true solution is a revitalized economy, providing real jobs of permanent economic viability. That is our goal, and we're going to stick to it.
Now above all is. the time to stay on course. I say that, Mr. President, not least because only a firmly based economy can enable us to act as a strong and effective partner in an alliance—and that we are determined to be, because an enduring alliance with the United States is fundamental to our beliefs and our objectives. Never in the post-war years has that alliance been more essential to us all. You spoke of Winston Churchill. We all do. Nearly 50 years ago Winston told our two countries that together there is no problem we cannot solve. We are together tonight. Together let us prove him right.
Mr. President, it is my very, very great pleasure to ask the assembled company to rise and drink a toast to our wonderful host, the new leader not only of the United States but of the whole of the Western World. I give you the toast: The President of the United States, President Reagan.
The President. Madam Prime Minister, thank you very much.
And now may I invite all of you to go to the Green and the Blue and the Red Rooms for coffee and liqueurs, and from there then make your way into the East Room, where you started this evening and where we are going to be entertained for a period by the Harlem Ballet.
So, I think we shall lead the way and all have our coffee in there.
[The President spoke at 9:24 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the White House.
Following the entertainment in the East Room, the President spoke at 10:30 p.m. as follows.]
Madam Prime Minister, Mr. Thatcher, Carol, Mr. Vice President, Barbara, all of you ladies and gentlemen:
I don't know how many of you know, this is the Harlem Ballet—12 years. Arthur Mitchell, would you stand up?
I think all of these young people here will agree, Arthur Mitchell is the man who had a dream 12 years ago and these young people from Harlem that he took and he put together in this very graceful and beautiful display that we've seen here. Nancy and I saw them a few weeks ago when they opened at the Kennedy Center in a full evening of ballet, and they have kindly come here to entertain us, and we are deeply grateful to them. And I think that what Arthur has done and the pride that he must have in seeing such beauty here on the stage and such grace—I just said to the Prime Minister while you were dancing, ""Who could lack faith in the human race when they can produce such beauty and grace as we have seen here?""
We thank all of you. Now there's going to be dancing in the foyer, but again, our heartfelt thanks to all of you, and we hope we'll see you again soon.
Thank you.

state-dinners,George Bush,"December 05, 1990","
Mr. President, my friend Carlos Menem, thank you for those very kind words. And it has been a very great honor for Dorothy, our daughter, and me and for the rest of us on the American side to be received in this magnificent setting, to be received so warmly by your people, and to be received so warmly by your very special President, Carlos Menem. We are simply delighted to be here in this beautiful country that has rejoined the ranks of the world's great democracies, a democracy built on what your national anthem refers to as the ""sacred cry"" of freedom.
I liked what your President said about a nation together for the final takeoff. And Carlos -- or Mr. President -- [laughter] -- I have the feeling that you have involved the people and that the people are proud in their support. And this week, by your firm action, supported by the people, you proved again that no one will take away the freedom of the Argentinean people.
You've helped reestablish this wonderful democratic tradition, and I salute your bold reform of the economy. You're rising to the challenges laid out in the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative for all nations in the hemisphere to join together to boost trade, investment, and growth.
Today President Menem and I talked at length about these issues and how best to bring economic recovery to this hemisphere. We recalled progress already made. And I spoke at some length about these ideas, which are of immense importance to our nations, during my speech at your Congress earlier today. And tonight President Menem has given an eloquent response, and I thank him.
But even though we've been here just a short time, this visit has again reminded me of the likenesses that unite our peoples. Think of our nations' beauty. One of America's patriotic songs -- ""purple mountains' majesty"" and ""amber waves of grain"" -- that would define Argentina, as would the words of Jose [Jorge] Luis Borges, describing this city's ""silent magic that captures newcomers almost totally."" Think of the splendor of the Andes, the jungles of Misiones, or the valleys of Patagonia; and they match the sweep of the continent that is America. And think, also, of other likenesses. We both were founded on equality and liberty. Each of us reveres the individual: you, the gaucho; we, the cowboy. We both honor values like work, family, belief in country, belief in God.
These likenesses have helped Argentina create a world where, as President Menem said last year, ""More and more, every day, we all depend upon one another."" And I agree. And I want to thank you, Mr. President, and your people for standing as allies in the Persian Gulf against Saddam Hussein's naked aggression. Together, we will do what is right, and we will do what is good -- and we will prevail.
In that spirit and with real gratitude in my heart, I ask our guests to stand and raise their glasses: To the nation of Argentina; to friendship between us that has never been more strong; and to the health of my friend and distinguished colleague, Carlos Menem, the President of Argentina.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"May 24, 2011","
Queen Elizabeth II. Mr. President, I am delighted to welcome you and Mrs. Obama to London. Prince Philip and I are so glad that you are visiting the United Kingdom again.
We have fond memories of our first meeting during the G-20 conference in London in 2009. It also gave me much pleasure to welcome Mrs. Obama and your two daughters here almost 2 years ago.
Your visit to this country inevitably reminds us of our shared history, our common language, and our strong intellectual and cultural links. It also reminds us that your country twice came to the rescue of the free and democratic world when it was facing military disaster. On each occasion, after the end of those destructive wars, the generosity of the United States made a massive contribution to our economic recovery.
Today, the United States remains our most important ally, and our two nations contribute to the security and prosperity of our peoples and of the world through shared national interests.
But our relationship goes far beyond our military and diplomatic ties. In your Inaugural Address, you spoke to the American people of the values that lay at the heart of your Nation's success--honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism--and of the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions with which your Nation had met past challenges and would meet future ones too.
If I may say so, these values underscore much of the life of the United Kingdom also. Together with our alliance, they continue to guide our actions as we confront the challenges of a changing world.
It is unfortunate that there are so many troubles facing the world today. But we are encouraged that in most respects, our two countries see these problems in the same light. For this reason, we have been able to act together in fields as varied as science, research, and higher education, to find solutions or to at least make progress towards tackling so many of the social and economic difficulties that confront nations in all parts of the globe.
Entertainment may not be so obviously an example of our close ties, but it forms part of the lives of a great many of our people. Over the years, we have enjoyed some of America's most spectacular musical productions and any number of what we call films, which you might prefer to call movies. [Laughter] In return, British films and theatrical productions have achieved considerable success in your country. This exchange of people and projects has enlarged and invigorated our common language, although I think you will agree, we do not always use it in quite the same way. [Laughter]
Mr. President, I firmly believe that the strength of our links and many shared interests will continue to ensure that when the United States and the United Kingdom stand together, our people and other people of good will around the world will be more secure and can become more prosperous.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to celebrate the tried, tested, and yes, special relationship between our two countries. I, therefore, ask you now to join me in raising your glasses to the continued health, happiness, and prosperity of the people of the United States of America, and especially to the health of President and Mrs. Obama.
[At this point, a toast was offered, and the band played the American national anthem.]
President Obama. Your Majesty, thank you for your extraordinarily generous remarks, for the invitation you extended for our first state visit in Europe, and for the warm friendship that you've shown both Michelle and myself on both of our visits to Buckingham Palace.
I bring warm greetings from tens of millions of Americans who claim British ancestry, including me, through my mother's family. I bring warm greetings from Malia and Sasha, who adored you even before you let them ride on a carriage on the palace grounds. [Laughter]
Prime Minister Cameron, Mrs. Cameron, and distinguished guests, it is a great honor to join you again in this great country as we reaffirm the enduring bonds between our two nations and reinforce this special relationship.
I must say, though, this dinner is a humbling reminder of the fleeting nature of Presidencies and Prime Ministerships. Your Majesty's reign has spanned about a dozen of each, and counting. That makes you both a living witness to the power of our alliance and a chief source of its resilience.
Our alliance is a commitment that speaks to who we are. As Winston Churchill said on a visit to the United States, ""Above all, among the English-speaking peoples, there must be the union of hearts based upon convictions and common ideals.""
While our challenges have changed since Churchill's time, when we fought together to preserve our very democracies, our adherence to those values have not. Our relationship rests on common language, common history, common adherence to the rule of law, the rights of men and women--the very ideals born in this nation. And yet our relationship never rests.
As we approach the 10th anniversary of 9/11, I'm particularly grateful for the solidarity that the United Kingdom has shown to America over the past decade. From that day to this, you have been our closest partner in the struggle to protect our people from terrorist attacks and violent extremism around the world, despite very heavy sacrifices here. And allow me to pay tribute to the contributions of your military forces, which have stood shoulder to shoulder with us for decades.
And as we confront the challenges of the 21st century together, we can have confidence in the partnership that our two countries share, based on the rock-solid foundation built during Queen Elizabeth's lifetime of extraordinary service to her nation and to the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand with me and raise your glasses as I propose a toast: To Her Majesty the Queen----
[The band began to play the British national anthem.]
----for the vitality of the special relationship between our peoples, and in the words of Shakespeare, ""To this blessed plot, this Earth, this realm, this England.""
To the Queen.
Queen Elizabeth II. That's very kind.
"
state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"December 17, 1979","
THE PRESIDENT. As you all know, England is one of the first nations on Earth, perhaps the first, to have a woman as ruler of the country, and we are very honored tonight to have the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who's a distinguished guest. She's able to share the responsibilities for the United Kingdom with the Queen. Unfortunately, the President of the United States has to do both. [Laughter]
One of the ceremonial duties of every President when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Great Britain, comes here, is to remind him or her that the British burned this house in 1812. [Laughter] Fortunately, we had a very lively woman who lived here then, Dolley Madison, who unrolled these portraits of George Washington and his wife, Martha, took them out beyond the Potomac River, and saved them. And George Washington returned to the White House, in his portrait, after the war was over. I hope that after the visit of this British entourage that the present President might be able to return to the White House after the next election year. [Laughter] But I can't make any predictions about that.
I've had a chance today to meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and I met her earlier when she visited this country before she was Prime Minister. And I met with her in some very intense economic and energy discussions and talked about the interrelationship among the democratic developed nations of the Earth in Tokyo early this year. I've been very highly impressed with her. Charles Dickens said in ""The Pickwick Papers,"" ""She knows what's what, she does."" [Laughter] And I think this very accurately describes the Prime Minister of Great Britain.
Today we talked about strategic arms limitation talks, the control of conventional weapons, the deployment of theater nuclear forces in Europe, the strengthening of the Atlantic Alliance, the European Community and how those nations interrelate one with another, the problems in Rhodesia. And I want officially to congratulate her and Lord Carrington for the tremendous achievement that was announced today when the Patriotic Front initialed the agreement on which you've worked so successfully, and I want to congratulate you both.
This shows what the yearning for peace and freedom can do, when given an opportunity by a distinguished and strong and courageous leader and a diplomat who knows the sensitivities of others and who honors those sensitivities in a strong and forceful way. It's indeed a triumph, and we are grateful to be part of the announcement today.
We talked about the future of Namibia, which I think will be greatly enhanced by the achievement of the recent days. We talked about the refugees, not only in Indochina but around the world, the unfortunate people, and the need for the developed democratic nations on Earth, who've been blessed so greatly, to give them a better life, some alleviation of their suffering, some hope for the future.
We talked about the intricate problems of energy, of nations who are great energy producers, and nations who are great, perhaps excessive, energy consumers. We talked about the domestic problems of inflation and providing jobs for our people. We talked about international trade and how this might draw nations closer together and to transcend international borders.
We talked about terrorism, the harming of innocent people to achieve political goals which quite often, most often, are indeed unworthy. She is dealing on a daily basis with terrorism in Northern Ireland. We stand staunchly beside her in condemning bloodshed and violence, death and murder, and I hope that our country will always be an assistant to her and to the leaders of Great Britain in dealing with this threat to peace and freedom and the proper interrelationship of human beings.
We talked about Iran and another exhibition of international terrorism, where innocent people are being persecuted, held prisoner, threatened with their very lives for the achievement of unworthy political goals.
We talked about many other issues that are important to our people. But the overwhelming sense that I had was one that we constantly share responsibilities and opportunities, both now, in the future, and in the past. The ties that bind the people of Great Britain with those of the United States are so strong that nothing can sever them one from another.
We are a nation, as I said this morning, of diverse nationalities. Perhaps the most diverse constituency in the world is the one that I have. People from all over this Earth came here to live. But we have a special relationship with Great Britain, our mother country. Walt Whitman, who perhaps more than any other American poet represented what Americans see and feel and believe, said, ""I hear the running of the Thames River in my speech."" Perhaps you can't hear the running of the Thames River in my speech since I'm a Georgian— [laughter] —but I don't think anyone can escape who lives here-whether we're from the South or the North, whether our ancestors came from England or Ireland or Poland or from China or from Japan or from the Philippines—we have part of England in us, because the principles on which our Nation was rounded, our deep concepts of freedom and individuality, of democratic government originated in our mother country.
We are very honored to have Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as our guest, and we would like to pay tribute now to her, to her nation, and to the United Kingdom. And I would like to propose a toast to Her Majesty the Queen. To the Queen.
THE PRIME MINISTER. Mr. President, Mrs. Carter, ladies and gentlemen:
It has been my first visit to Washington as head of the British Government, and I should like, at the end of a memorable day, to say thank you. Thank you, to you, Mr. President, to you, Mrs. Carter, and through you to the American people for the wonderfully warm welcome I've been given everywhere.
I know, Mr. President, that as you pointed out at the beginning of your speech, the relationship between America and Britain started off with one or two errors of judgment on our side. [Laughter] Looking around me at the beauty here and at the wonderful nation you've created, I'm really rather glad that my predecessors weren't successful in all things they tried to carry out.
Now, I know that official visits to Washington recur' almost with the regularity of the passing seasons, but as far as I'm concerned, this really has been an exceptional event in the year for me. Alas, I'll not be staying long, but it makes a great difference to me to have this chance of direct discussion and to sense at first hand what it is that quickens the pulse of the American people, their yearnings and preoccupations.
I'm very much aware, Mr. President, of the ordeal that the United States is going through at the moment. It's a double ordeal, for the fate of the 50 hostages in Tehran, from whom our thoughts are never far, and for the temper of the United States as a whole. You'll not want me to speak at length about this now, but I'd be giving you a false impression if I allowed the evening to proceed any further without letting you know how much we, in Britain, support you in your ordeal at this time.
The United States is our friend, our ally, and our time-honored partner in peace and war. The history and the destiny of our countries have been and always will be inextricably intertwined. Our friendship goes back a very long way. We are, after all, among the very few countries in the world whose constitutions and national identities have remained intact over two centuries. I hope you won't mind, Mr. President, my recalling that George Washington was a British subject until well after his 40th birthday. [Laughter] I've been told, to my surprise, that he does not have a place in the British Dictionary of National Biography. I suppose the editors must have regarded him as a late developer. [Laughter]
I confess to you that in some ways my visit got off to rather a shaky start, because I was told on arrival at Andrews Field that I had interrupted your Secretary of State, Mr. Vance, in one of his few moments of relaxation. He was watching the Redskins playing the Cowboys. [Laughter] He had to take his eye off the game to greet me. I'm very grateful, but I don't think the Redskins can have been very grateful to me, because it was no doubt as a result of this diversion of Mr. Vance's attention that the Redskins lost the game. I do apologize for having intervened in your internal affairs. [Laughter]
Mr. Vance's opposite number, Lord Carrington, who's with us this evening, has, as you know—and as you very kindly said, Mr. President—had something of a triumph in the Rhodesia negotiations at Lancaster House in London. If you think he looks a little pale, it's because he's been shut up in Lancaster House for many months, indeed has become known as the prisoner of Lancaster House. And he's so pleased to be free at last.
Lord Carrington would, I know, want me to repeat this evening how grateful the British Government are to the United States authorities for the stalwart support they've given us unfailingly over Rhodesia. And you, Mr. President, and you, Mr. Vance, we would like to give our warmest and most heartfelt thanks, because without your support the whole process would have been incomparably more difficult, and we may never have reached success.
May I say one more thing, Mr. President. The government which I lead has been in power now for just over half a year. We face great difficulties, some of them deep-seated and longstanding and some stemming from beyond our shores-and I don't pretend that anything is going to be remedied immediately. But we are determined upon a change. We're determined to return to the first principles which have traditionally governed our political and economic life, namely. the overall responsibility of the individual rather than the state for his own welfare, and the paramountcy of Parliament for the protection of fundamental rights.
The government I lead has a resounding mandate to restore the faith and the fortunes of the nation. We shall stick at the task whatever the difficulties and however great the endurance required. And we shall do so, Mr. President, in the conviction that our allies across the Atlantic have confidence in us, just as we have confidence in the strength and ingenuity of the United States to meet any challenge and triumph over any adversity that confronts them.
And it's in that spirit that I would like to ask all your other guests this evening to drink a toast to you, the President of the United States of America.
The President.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"February 06, 1979","
THE PRESIDENT. Prime Minister Kriangsak, Mrs. Virat, all the distinguished guests from Thailand, and our friends from throughout our country:
First of all, let me say that it's a great honor for me to welcome all of you guests to the White House and, particularly, our honored guest, who comes here representing a great nation and a great people.
This is the first time since 1968 that we've had a Prime Minister from Thailand come as an honored and official guest to visit the White House. And I think it was in 1967 that King Phumiphol came here with Her Majesty, the Queen, to visit the President.
So, this is indeed a rare pleasure and a long overdue visit, Mr. Prime Minister, on your part, to the White House, to pay homage to the friendship that has existed between our two countries for more than 150 years.
As I mentioned today in my welcoming remarks, the first nation in Asia with whom the United States signed a treaty of peace was with the people of Thailand, then known as Siam, in 1833, February 1833, 145—146 years ago. And we are very deeply grateful for the tremendous benefits that have accrued to our country from this long relationship between our people.
Thailand has been a country with very sound judgment, wisdom among the leaders-not always perfect, but close to it.
In 1861, for instance, King Rama was not very well advised. He offered to give a fleet of elephants to then President Lincoln to help expedite the end of the War Between the States. [Laughter] Fortunately for the South, President Lincoln did not accept the gift— [laughter] — otherwise, the North might have won the war— [laughter] —and because of the elephants, President Lincoln might even have become a Republican. [Laughter]
I want to say that we have enjoyed this visit. And since I've been in office, I've tried to continue the goal of our Nation to establish very close and friendly relationships with the people of Asia.
We've been commenting lately that for the first time, certainly in my memory, we now have a close friendship, personally and officially, with the great nations of Asia—with India, Japan, China, as well as the rapidly growing economic organization known as the ASEAN countries. Thailand is certainly one of those leaders.
But when you travel down the coast of Asia, the Western Pacific, Eastern Asia, we have growing friendships with that extremely important region.
We've recently concluded a new base agreement with the Philippines, and I think that the recent visit of Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping has been, perhaps, one of the most notable occurrences, certainly in my term as President. And the far-reaching historical effects of that change in relationships may, perhaps, be the most important development, historically speaking, during my own term in office.
And Prime Minister Kriangsak very early saw the advantages of this new relationship and expressed his public approval of this change which can help to provide increased opportunities for stability and peace throughout Eastern Asia.
At the same time, as the Prime Minister and I discussed today, we still retain our friendship, our allegiance, our trade, our cultural relationships with the people of Taiwan, and we believe that the security of Taiwan has not at all been weakened and the prospects for their future peace and security may even have been enhanced.
We have strengthened our ties with Australia, New Zealand. So, I believe that in that region of the world, we have been making excellent progress.
I have benefited greatly from the sound advice and counsel of Prime Minister Kriangsak, both before he came here and obviously during this visit. He's a man who represents the political leadership of a great nation and a people who have long looked upon our country as intimate friends.
During the Korean war, under the auspices of the United Nations, the people of Thailand fought with us, and then Major Kriangsak was a blood brother, defending freedom alongside Americans. And this is still looked upon by him as one of the most notable experiences of his life.
We have come to value the principles that have been exemplified, without interruption, among the people of Thailand—a country dedicated to peace, a country dedicated to personal freedom, a country dedicated to the extension of their own beneficial influence among their neighboring nations, a nation that has never tried to dominate others and which has always been using its influence, again, to help preserve the independence of peoples and countries throughout the world.
Even during the time European colonialism was extended almost entirely throughout the Asian world, there was one nation that stayed free, and that was the people of Thailand. This shows a strength founded not on overwhelming military might, but on wisdom, justice, and the principles on which our own Nation was founded.
We are honored because we have found so much in common with the people of Thailand. And the security relationships, the political relationships, the economic relationships that have naturally come to be shared between our two people have been of intense value both to them, as expressed by the Prime Minister to me today, and obviously have been of great value to the people of our own country.
We are concerned about recent developments in Kampuchea, or Cambodia, the invasion of that country by their neighbors, the Vietnamese. We joined with Thailand and the other countries of the ASEAN region in the United Nations, in a proper way, to condemn this violation of international borders, again, not plotting against anyone, but expressing the concern that we feel very deeply and the concern of the overwhelming number of governments throughout the world about this threat to the peace of the region.
But again, Thailand stands like a rock, honored and respected by their historical friends and allies, also honored and respected even by their potential adversaries.
I read the biographies of the leaders of Thailand who came here today with the Prime Minister. And in almost every intimate and, I think, accurate biography that I read in preparation for the visit, there was a phrase that caught my eye, referring to intense, personal honesty or a total absence of fraud and corruption throughout the political career of those who serve Thailand.
So, the cleanness and the decency and the patriotism and the personal commitment to the service of one's fellow human beings is indeed a permeating characteristic of the Prime Minister and those who serve with him in this great country.
The name Thailand itself comes from ""the land of freedom."" And I'm very deeply honored tonight to share with you other Americans the role of host to the leaders of a great people.
I would like now to propose a toast: To His Majesty the King of Thailand, to Prime Minister Kriangsak, his family, and those who've come with him, and to the great and free people of the land of the free, Thailand.
THE PRIME MINISTER. Mr. President, Mrs. Carter, distinguished guests and friends:
We have been warmed and delighted by your welcome for me and my colleagues today, and we all wish to express our profound gratitude for the hospitality and friendliness we have encountered since our arrival. It is indeed a special occasion to be once again in the United States, where we have so many good friends and so many happy associations.
Earlier today, we had an opportunity to discuss together some matters of mutual concern and of vital importance for the future well-being of my country, of Southeast Asia, and, perhaps, of the world.
For the past 40 years, the United States has been the leader of the world. You have been in the forefront of scientific and technical developments. You have led the effort for a peaceful world. You have been a major moral force for human betterment which has intensified under the leadership of President Carter. The United States has been indispensable, Mr. President.
I'm pleased that you share our strong views about the importance of the American presence in Asia and the Pacific and the need for an active and constructive U.S. role in Southeast Asia. Such an American role and presence quite simply is needed if peace is to be strengthened and prosperity expanded. We, for our part, have been grateful for American help in protecting our security and expanding our economy.
I hope that I was able to give you and our American friends and colleagues an accurate picture of Thailand today. We are a proud but peace-loving people who cherish our traditional institutions and our way of life. Monarchy, Buddhism, and nation are all integral parts of the Thai fiber. In most of our domestic and foreign policy, we share with you a wide convergence of views and a strong mutuality of interests.
Our highest priority at home is to build a modern, just, and prosperous society and, at the same time, preserve that culture which defines our national identity. Toward that end, my government is concentrating on helping our poorer farmers and accelerating agricultural growth. I have named this year in Thailand the Year of the Farmer, and my government will do its utmost to give meaning to that phrase.
Like Americans, the Thai people recognize the importance of human rights and the connection between economic prosperity and the development of human potential.
Like you, we favor economic growth spurred by individual initiative. We also want to see American investment in Thailand. We need and welcome your businessmen. They can both serve themselves and serve the people of Thailand as well.
In foreign affairs, we seek to build stable friendships with all nations in Asia, based on mutual respect and noninterference without regard to ideology.
The establishment of relations between the United States and the people of the republic of China will be a major contribution to the peace and stability of Asia. Similarly, although we are small and less directly involved, we welcome your efforts to develop a more constructive relationship with the Soviet Union and to conclude a SALT agreement.
We live in an age where peace is indivisible and where peace is essential among the great powers.
One area of particular concern to Thailand is the continually troubled Indochina. Peace has not yet come. Cambodia, or Kampuchea, with which we have a long common border, remains beset by war. The tragic exodus of Indochina's refugees continues at even higher levels, and the burden has fallen most heavily on Thailand and Malaysia.
But here, also, your country has played an exemplary role. The Thai people do not expect anyone to solve our problems. That is our responsibility. And we are confident we will meet it. But we do need the understanding and cooperation of the international community and, most importantly, the commitment of the United States to help us deal with international problems which start beyond our borders but impact heavily on Thailand.
For this reason, we ask for your continued awareness and support in meeting the challenge to our common humanitarian principles posed by thousands of refugees arriving on our shores and those of other countries in Southeast Asia.
We ask your cooperation in helping us to purchase, on a timely basis, the means we need to defend ourselves. And we look to you as a friend and as the world's most advanced nation for the knowledge and technology to help advance the social welfare of our people. And that is all we ask.
Mr. President, Thailand and the United States have a long history of close friendship, common interests, and shared values. The United States helped Thailand in extraterritoriality, and you have consistently helped us maintain our integrity. No other nation has been as close to us these past 40 years, and no other nation's intentions and values do we hold in such high esteem.
We hope that this visit, together with Vice President Mondale's visit to Thailand in May of last year, will underscore to our people and to the rest of the world the determination of Thailand and the United States to continue to cooperate for peace and stability in Asia.
I and my colleagues wish to express our deepest thanks to you and Mrs. Carter and, through you, to all American people, for your hospitality, graciousness, and thoughtfulness for Thailand.
This is a very special occasion and we want to say simply how pleased my colleagues and I are.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to join me in a toast: To the President of the United States.

state-dinners,George Bush,"March 06, 1990","
The President. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get this part out of the way early. [Laughter]
Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Andreotti and distinguished guests, friends of Italy, all: Barbara and I are very pleased to welcome you to the White House tonight to honor the President of the Council of Ministers in the Republic of Italy, our friend Mr. Andreotti. And later on this evening, we will be celebrating Italy's national pastime with a performance by one of the world's greatest opera singers. We'll leave it as a little bit of a surprise. [Laughter]
But I am reminded of a story concerning America's national pastime. It seems that great Italian tenor, Enrico Caruso, was asked by a group of American reporters what he thought of Babe Ruth. Caruso, ever polite, replied that he didn't know, because unfortunately he had never heard her sing. [Laughter]
One American writer called Italy ""The Land of the Immortal Gods"" -- not just the land of mythology but the home of eternal ideas symbolized by the immortal genius of Da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael; the timeless architecture -- the Piazza San Marco in Venice; the classic strains heard in La Scala, in Milan. And Italy is the spiritual home of millions -- St. Peter's in Rome -- and the ancestral home of 12 million Americans. And many are here tonight, including our OAS Ambassador Luigi Einaudi, who is also the grandson of Italy's first President.
And Mr. Prime Minister, you are one of America's closest friends, and you know our country well. And we are proud and honored to be with you. We certainly agree on the key role that Italy plays in the new, emerging Europe. And in my discussions with Prime Minister Andreotti today and over the past months, we have shared the excitement on the remarkable changes that we are seeing. I can think of no time in modern history when our strong transatlantic partnership was more crucial.
They say that all the roads lead to Rome, and so Italy was appropriately my first stop on my first visit to Europe as President of the United States. And together we set the tone for critical arms reduction proposals, now even closer to fulfillment. We totally agree that a strong NATO is vital to our collective security in the new Europe. German unification with a unified Germany remaining a full member of NATO, support for the rising democracies in Eastern Europe, and the continued role of the United States as a force for stability in Europe are all part of our agenda today. And as we've done so often in the past, we found much agreement. But we also have much to look forward to.
This summer, we will meet again at the Houston economic summit. And then, beginning in July, Italy becomes Chairman of the European Community, and our two governments will work to develop stronger economic and political ties between the United States and the EC. But most important of all, there is perhaps the toughest issue between our two nations, a meeting which will take place this summer in Italy. And our side has already made bold advances against other nations involved, but we must be allowed to compete on a level playing field. And that's right, I'm talking about the 1990 World Cup in soccer. [Laughter]
And so, Mr. Prime Minister, and our friend, our discussions today reinforced my deep admiration for you and your nation. To our noble and strong union, and to you and the citizens of the Republic of Italy, I ask our guests to join me in a toast. A salute to you and to your great country, sir.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, the number of our Cabinets, which is a feature of Italy's political life but does not affect the stability of our democracy, has provided me with other opportunities to come to the White House in the last years, although in different ministerial capacities.
Being back in the United States today after more than a decade as President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic is indeed a source of great satisfaction to me. Many decisive events have taken place in the meantime which our continents have often lived through, side by side, in a relationship of alliance and cooperation which has been strong and vital. The world has become increasingly complex and interdependent and certainly not easier to manage today.
I am especially happy to be visiting Washington at this moment when the world, and Europe in particular, are living through such an exciting and crucial time. On the European continent, a decades-long ideological and military confrontation is giving way with astounding speed to new balances and to the promising establishment of democracy in the Eastern European nations. A new Europe is coming into being, in which we trust that a reduction in tensions will make the presence of armaments less disquieting.
We Italians have always believed that Atlantic solidarity would one day bear fruit. My seniority as a politician would enable me to reel off every single stage in this long process, both of resistance and of political cohesion. And we Italians have always held the view that the political and military commitment of the United States and Europe was an indispensable condition for the ultimate success of our common endeavor. Well, Mr. President, Italy is still convinced today -- more than ever before, if it were possible -- that this solidarity must continue to inspire our action. The continuing military and political presence of the United States in Europe is basic to ensuring stability and balance for the whole world.
As ideological and military confrontations wane, Europe needs a broader framework for cooperation, a form which by strengthening the Helsinki formula develops into a system for comprehensive dialog with the participation of the United States and Canada. And together with NATO, this is the institutional framework in which we can together tackle issues related to the growth of the budding democracies in the East, the reunification of the two Germanys, and the development of the new relationship with the Soviet Union -- in short, and to borrow your own words, Mr. President, the construction of that whole and free Europe which is already taking shape and to which we all look forward with hope.
Italy feels it is part of this Europe -- and indeed, an essential one. But I would like to recall that Italy, by its nature in history, is also part of the Mediterranean world. We shall continue to follow the problems of that area very closely, including longstanding ones such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Lebanese crisis, and the problems related to the future development of each people in this important area.
Naturally, Mr. President, what we need today is a new solidarity. By this, I mean a solidarity between the United States and Europe that is newer and subtler than the one tested so successfully at a time when we were threatened from the exterior. This kind of solidarity is today both indispensable and urgent to enable both Europe and the United States to jointly take up other challenges, whether regional or global in scope. I'm referring to the backwardness and indebtedness of developing countries, to environmental protection, and to the fight against drugs, which you, Mr. President, very clearly stated to be an absolute priority issue, showing your solidarity to the Latin American countries which are most suffering at the hands of drug traffickers.
Mr. President, all kinds of dictatorships have failed, even those which believe that by sacrificing freedom they would succeed in solving the economic and social problems of their peoples. To a nation such as the United States that has provided and is providing a generous and sustained contribution to freedom in all continents, we renew the expression of our convinced friendship, genuinely rooted in our hearts and minds and inspired by constructive spirit.
Mr. President, I ask you and all your guests here to make a toast to your health and that of Mrs. Bush. And also, I would like to invite you, if the American soccer team is going to win, to come to Rome and assist to the last game. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Well done, sir. Thank you. Very nice. Thank you so much.
"
state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"June 30, 1979","
PRESIDENT PARK. Mr. President, Mrs. Carter, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
This evening, we are honored to have as our guests the leader of our closest ally and the champion of world peace, President Jimmy Carter of the United States, and Mrs. Carter. It gives me a great pleasure to extend to them a heartfelt welcome on behalf of all my fellow countrymen.
I am very happy that this afternoon I had a sincere and fruitful exchange of views with President Carter on matters of mutual interest and a very friendly atmosphere.
President Carter's state visit to the Republic of Korea at this time, I believe, will provide a momentum for further strengthening the traditional bonds of friendship between our two countries and will offer encouragement to all peace-loving nations whose interests are linked to the United States policy toward Asia.
I also believe that President Carter's visit to Korea, one of the most conspicuous conflict areas of the world today, will give him a valuable opportunity to deepen his understanding of the heart of the problem in this area.
It is noteworthy that recently a series of important changes have been taking place in Asia and the Pacific. The developments include the improvement in the Sino-American relations, the Sino-Japanese relations, conflicts in Indochina, with their repercussions, and the fluid Sino-Soviet relations.
In the vortex of these changes, many Asian nations are striving harder for their national security and economic development by fortifying their spirits of self-reliance.
I note, in this connection, that the firm determination and the power of the United States to preserve peace have been playing a significant role in the developments of situation in Asia and the Pacific.
We have been following closely the subtle changes and the developments in this area. We will continue to endeavor to overcome many challenges with wisdom and steadfastness in shaping our destiny courageously.
Mr. President, it is really regrettable that the clouds of war still hang over the Korean peninsula despite our sincere efforts to deter a recurrence of war and to establish peace on the peninsula.
The North Korean Communists are implacably pursuing their military buildup in defiance of the international trend toward rapprochement and of the stark reality of the Korean situation, as well as of the long-cherished aspiration of the 50 million Koreans. The North Koreans have already constructed a number of underground invasion tunnels across the Demilitarized Zone.
In contrast, the Republic of Korea has opened wide its doors on the basis of principle of reciprocity to all nations of the world, including those who have ideologies and institutions different from ours. Furthermore, we have repeatedly proposed to North Korea to conclude a nonaggression agreement aimed at establishing peace—a most urgent task in the Korean peninsula—and to start social and economic exchanges between the South and North of Korea.
At the beginning of this year also, I called upon the North Korean side to open dialog between the responsible authorities of the South and the North at any place, at any time, and at any level, in order to prevent a recurrence of war and to cooperate to speed up the peaceful unification of our fatherland. However, no sincere response has yet been made by North Korea.
But we shall not despair. We shall keep our doors open for dialog in our firm belief that the .day of our national reunion will eventually come.
We want peace. We are making every effort to bring about peace. We will continue our peace efforts.
Over the last generation, the Republic of Korea and the United States have continued to develop a close and effective, cooperative relationship to promote our common interests with the firm conviction that the peace and stability on the Korean peninsula are essential to the maintenance of peace in Northeast Asia and are also closely related to world peace.
Mr. President, it is a common aspiration of the developing countries today that their living standards should be enhanced in order to live in peace without fear of war, to expel poverty, and to restore human dignity.
Even in the face of the threats and provocations from the North, the Republic of Korea has established a remarkable record of continued economic development and made long strides in building our national strength for self-defense and for the safeguard of peace.
I firmly believe that the achievements we have made in such a short period of time without sufficient national resources, particularly after the total destruction from the Korea war, are the fruits of the sweat and toil of all our people. This record of achievements is not only an actual proof that demonstrates the superiority of a free, open society we have defended together but also constitutes a valuable national asset.
Furthermore, as a nation with a 5,000-year history of culture and tradition, we are marching forward to build a welfare society where social justice, humanity, and morality prevail.
We have found a democratic system which best suits our actual circumstances and which is the most effective in solving our own problems. This system upholds freedom based on law and order and assures the full creativity of the individual.
Mr. President, the relations between the Republic of Korea and the United States date back to 100 years ago. During the last three decades in particular, our two countries have developed a very close relationship. The alliance relationship between the Republic of Korea and the United States will remain the bedrock of our foreign policy.
Our friendship, which was further strengthened through the Korean war and and the Vietnam war, has today grown through the promoting of trade, as well as through the expansion of exchanges and cooperation in social, scientific, cultural, and other fields.
We are well aware that the growth of our national strength which we have achieved owes to the friendly support of the Government and people of the United States.
I have a firm conviction that the growth of our national strengths will not only serve the interests of the Republic of Korea but also make constructive contributions to the peace and prosperity of Northeast Asia and the Pacific.
Our two countries, reaffirming the necessity for productive cooperation in various fields, are now entering a new era of mature partnership based on mutual respect and deepened mutual understanding.
I sincerely hope the ties of friendship and cooperation between our two countries would be steadily consolidated as a result of President Carter's state visit to the Republic of Korea and further hope that this auspicious occasion will serve as a powerful propelling force in opening for us a glorious Pacific era in the 1980's.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I now ask you to rise and join me in a toast to one everlasting friendship and prosperity of our two countries and to the continued good health and success of our state guests, President of the United States of America and Mrs. Jimmy Carter.
Thank you.
PRESIDENT CARTER. Mr. President, distinguished officials of the Governments of our two great nations, and distinguished guests:
The Korean people have been famous throughout history for the kindness and graciousness with which you receive visitors and guests. This has been proven again by the warmth and the affection of your welcome for Rosalynn, for Amy, for me, and for all the American party.
I have come to Asia to demonstrate the deep interest of the United States in this vital and dynamic part of the world. The United States has been, is, and will remain a Pacific nation and a Pacific power.
I've come to Korea to seek a new and even more constructive stage in one of our Nation's oldest and most valuable strategic, political, and economic relationships.
What has impressed me most about my visit to your country is the existence side by side of a deep sense of the continuity of history with dramatic signs of rapid growth and rapid change.
The respect and reverence of the people of Korea for your history is visible in the lovely shrines, temples, and monuments throughout Seoul. Ancient Korea had a profound cultural impact on the rest of the world, as was clearly shown by the magnificient exhibition which you recently sent to the United States.
As a former naval officer, I was particularly intrigued by the statue of Admiral Yi in the center of Seoul. I'm told that the ""turtle boats"" of the Admiral commanded in the 16th century were the world's first ironclad naval vessels. I suspect that in his time these Korean ships were as new and revolutionary as the nuclear submarines which I helped to develop.
My visit with our combat troops last night and this morning, Mr. President, was a reminder that in our more recent history, tens of thousands of your countrymen and mine fought and died side by side to defend this country against aggression. Everyone must know that Koreans and Americans will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder to prevent aggression on this peninsula and to preserve the peace. Our military commitment to Korea's security is strong, unshakable, and enduring.
The security interests of the United States are directly involved in that commitment. The vital interests of four great powers intersect in this very region today. That is why the maintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula is so vital to the international community.
Evidence of change in Korea is all around us. You can see among the Korean people the dynamism, the creative energy and dedication that have produced Korea's economic miracle out of a nation once so badly scarred by war.
I am impressed that the benefits of prosperity are widely shared by the Korean people. I understand that the income, for instance, of the average rural family in Korea now exceeds that of its urban counterpart. That accomplishment is almost unique among developing nations and should be a source of special pride to you.
Compare your progress with that of the economy in the North. The Republic of Korea is proof that a free economy is the clearest road to shared prosperity and a better life for all.
We also believe strongly in the United States that a free society is the key to realizing the full potential for development and growth.
There is a growing consensus among the international community about the fundamental value of human rights, individual dignity, political freedom, freedom of the press, and the rule of law. The free expression of ideas stimulates innovation and creativity. The right to participate in the political process helps to unite a country in the pursuit of common goals.
There is abundant evidence in Korea of the dramatic economic progress a capable and energetic people can achieve by working together. I believe that this achievement can be matched by similar progress through the realization of basic human aspirations in political and human rights.
Accelerating change is also the central fact of life throughout the international community in recent years—nowhere more so than in Asia, the home of one-third of the world's people today. China has turned outwards toward the United States, Japan, and the Western world in search of modern techniques and new relationships. Japan has assumed a position of new global influence. Korea, always strategically vital, has become a world economic force. The unity of the ASEAN nations is becoming a stabilizing factor throughout Southeast Asia.
Today we are entering a more mature stage in the U.S.-Korean relations. Our success will depend on whether we can take advantage of both historical continuity and dynamic change to foster progress in the areas which concern us both. Cooperation is the key.
We will cooperate to keep the Republic of Korea safe and secure. There need be no concern about this. As Korea grows stronger, the United States will do its part to preserve the military balance and to deter aggression.
We must take advantage of changes in the international environment to lower tensions between South and North and, ultimately, to bring permanent peace and reunification to the Korean peninsula.
We must work together to build a world in which the rule of law and the freedom and dignity of the individual govern all the affairs of mankind.
Finally, Mr. President, you have a saying in Korea, ""Even something as light as a piece of paper can be lifted more easily together."" None of the goals I've mentioned are light or easy. But I'm convinced that we can achieve them by working together in the spirit of cooperation and friendship that has united us down through the years.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and join me in a toast to President Park, to the great people of the Republic of Korea, and to our common efforts for cooperation, for friendship, and for peace.
This is an extraordinary occasion, and I would like to make an extraordinary request, that we jointly honor a man who has served both our countries so well. With your permission, Mr. President, I would like to ask General Vessey to join us before this group.
This is a citation to accompany the award of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal to John W. Vessey, Jr.
""General John W. Vessey, Jr., United States Army, distinguished himself by exceptionally distinguished service as a Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, and R.O.K.-U.S. Combined Forces Command, and as Commander, United States Forces, Korea, Eighth United States Army, during the period November 1976 to June 1979.
""General Vessey's superb performance has been clearly evidenced by outstanding leadership and managerial skills. With a keen perception of complex and sensitive military and political relationships, he solidified elements of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Korea, United States, and representative armed forces of other allied nations into a cohesive and formidable military force.
""In doing so, he conceived and refined new objectives and operational concepts which he persuasively articulated to the highest government officials of both nations. A significant historical milestone was reached during his tenure with the birth of the R.O.K.-U.S. Combined Forces Command.
""With General Vessey as its first Commander this organization of diverse national and military backgrounds has progressed into a most effective command, which has greatly enhanced participation by Republic of Korea armed forces in directing defense operations.
""General Vessey's professionalism and concerned leadership have been important factors in guiding the development of the military forces of both nations. His performance in a position of vital national interest and sensitivity has been clearly in keeping with the highest traditions of the military profession and reflects great credit upon himself, the United States Army, and the Department of Defense.""
I would like to ask General Vessey to join us on the platform.
It's with great pleasure and an honor for my country, General Vessey, that I pin this medal on your breast as a token of your superb performance for the United States of America and for the Republic of Korea.
GENERAL VESSEY. [In Korean] Tonight is my wife's birthday. [In English] What I said, Mr. President, was today is my wife's birthday, and thank you very much for the very special party. I don't know what I'll do next year.
I want to say it's been a singular honor for me to serve with the brave, fine Korean and American soldiers that serve to defend this country. It's been a great experience.
See, they don't trust my Korean. [Laughter] I could have said that myself.
Thank you.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"March 21, 2013","
President Peres. I think that's the President's remarks. Mr. President, can I read your speech, if you want me to? [Laughter] They are mistaken. [Laughter]
President Barack Obama, my dear friend, let me say first of all, bravo. Bravo, President.
It is my great pleasure to welcome you tonight. I was moved the way in which you spoke to the hearts of our young Israelis. Our youngsters, in time of need, are always willing to stand up and defend their country. Today you have seen how much the same young people long for peace. How enthusiastic they were, how engaged they were, listening to the vision of peace, which you beautifully delivered and moved the heart.
Mr. President, this morning several rockets were shot from the Gaza Strip toward the civilian targets in Israel, including Sderot, that you have visited. From here, in the name of all of us, I want to convey our love to the inhabitants of the south around Gaza, who carry this heavy burden courageously and continue to plow their land, their—plant their trees, raise their children. It is an inspiration to each of us. Today the enemies of peace spoke in the only language they know: the language of terror. I am convinced that together, we shall defeat them.
Dear Barack, your visit here is a historic event. We are so happy to receive you and your distinguished delegation. I am very glad to see Secretary John Kerry, a reassured friend. John, I know you are and I know you will be successful. I'm not sure that the prophets have had speechwriters—[laughter]—but if they had, I imagine Isaiah would have said—but actually, he has said on that occasion, and I'm quoting him—""How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation."" Well, you have to be satisfied with my tired language; I cannot speak like him. [Laughter]
It is my privilege to present you with our country's highest honor: the Medal of Distinction. This award speaks to you, to your tireless work to make Israel strong, to make peace possible. Your Presidency has given the closest ties between Israel and the United States a new height, a sense of intimacy, a vision for the future.
The people of Israel are particularly moved by your unforgettable contribution to their security: You are defending our skies. To you—[inaudible]—in the domain of intelligence, which is the right way to preempt bloodshed. The diplomatic and the military bonds between us have reached an unprecedented level.
When I visit you in Washington, I thought in my heart, America is so great, and we are so small. I learned that you don't measure us by size, but by values. Thank you. When it comes to values, we are you, and you are us. On occasions when we were alone, you stood with us so we were not alone. We were alone together. We shall never forget it.
During your previous visit to Israel, you asked me if I had any advice to offer. Well, it's not my nature not to let questions go unanswered. [Laughter] So I suggested that, while people say that the future belongs to the young, it is the present that really belongs to the young. Leave the future to me. I have time. [Laughter]
I think I was right, because the moment you came into office, you immediately had to face daunting and demanding challenges day in, day out. I prayed that you would meet them with wisdom and determination, without losing hope, without allowing others to lose hope. The prayers were answered; after all, they came from Jerusalem, and they came to us as a great message. It is a tribute to your leadership, to the strength of your character, to your principles, that you have never surrendered to hopelessness. You stood and stand firmly by your vision. Your values serve your nation. They serve our nation as well.
So I know that you will never stop to strive for a better world, as you say today in a good Hebrew, tikkun olam. We have a rich heritage and a great dream. As I look back, I feel that the Israel of today has exceeded the vision we have had 65 years ago. Reality has surpassed the dreams. The United States of America helped us to make this possible.
Still, the path to tomorrow may be fraught with obstacles. I believe that we can overcome them by our determination and by your commitment. I'm convinced that you will do whatever is necessary to free the world's horizons and the skies of Jerusalem from the Iranian threat. Iran denies the Shoah and calls for a new one. Iran is building a nuclear bomb and denies it. The Iranian regime is the greatest danger to the world peace. History has shown time and again that peace, prosperity, and stable civil society cannot flourish when threats and belligerency abound.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight the Iranian people are celebrating their New Year, Nowruz. I wish them, from the depths of my heart, a happy holiday and a real freedom.
Israel will seize any opportunity for peace. Being small, we have to maintain our qualitative edge. I know that you responded and will respond to it. The strength of Israel is its defense forces. They afford us the ability to seek peace. And what America has contributed to Israel's security is the best guarantee to end the march of folly, the march of terror and bloodshed.
We watch with admiration the way you lead the United States of America, the way you stayed true, time and again, to your bonds of friendship with us. Your commitment and deeds speaks volumes about the principles that guides America. To strive for freedom and democracy at home, but also all over the world, you send the boys to fight for the freedom of others. What is uplifting is that the United States brought freedom not only to its own people, but never stops, and never will stop, to help other people to become free.
You represent democracy at its best. You have deepened its meaning: namely, that democracy is not just the right to be equal, but the equal right to be different. Democracy is not just a free expression, but is self-expression as well.
You exemplify the spirit of democracy by striving for justice and equality of opportunity in the American society. As the world has now become global and yet remains individual, and you offer those principles. You have shown global responsibility and individual sensitivity.
On Monday night, Mr. President, we shall celebrate Passover, the festival of freedom, the celebration of spring. The celebration of spring means our journey from the house of slaves to the home of the free that started more than 3,000 years ago. We remember it every year. We are commended to feel as though each of us personally participated in that journey. We shall not forget where we came from. We shall remember always where we are headed to, which is to make the Promised Land a land of promise: a land of freedom, justice, and equality.
While reality calls for vigilance, Passover calls to remain believers. Israel is an island in a stormy sea. We have to make our island safe, and we wish that the sea will become tranquil. We converted our desert into a garden. It was achieved by the talents of our people and the potential of science. What we have done, Mr. President, can be done all over the Middle East, as you have rightly said tonight. Israel is described as a startup nation. The Middle East can become a startup region.
Dear President, you noted in your address today that peace is the greatest hope for the human being. I share your vision. Your call to reopen the peace process may pave the way for the implementation of the two-state solution agreed by all of us, as you said: a Jewish state, Israel; an Arab state, Palestine.
If I'm not wrong, next to you sits our Prime Minister, who was just reelected. He opened his address in the Knesset by reiterating his commitment to the two-state solution. Dear friends, I have seen in my life—I earned the right to believe—that peace is attainable. As you felt today, I know, this is the deep conviction of our people. With our resolve and your support, dear Barack Obama, we shall win, and it will happen.
Mr. President, I am privileged to bestow upon you the Medal of Distinction. It was recommended by a committee of seven prominent Israeli citizens, headed by our former Chief of Justice Meir Shamgar, and includes our former President Yitzhak Navon. It was my view and I was glad to accept their recommendation. You inspired the world with your leadership. Toda raba, Mr. President. Toda from a grateful nation to a very great leader.
God bless America. God bless Israel.
[At this point, the citation was read, and the President received the medal. President Peres then offered a toast.]
President Obama. Thank you so much. President Peres; Prime Minister Netanyahu and First Lady Sara; distinguished guests and friends: This is a extraordinary honor for me, and I could not be more deeply moved. And I have to say, after the incredible welcome I've received over the past 2 days and the warmth of the Israeli people, the tribute from President Peres, the honor of this medal, I mean, as you say, dayenu.
Now, I'm told that the Talmud teaches that you shouldn't pronounce all the praises of a person in their presence. And, Mr. President, if I praised all the chapters of your remarkable life, then we would be here all night. [Laughter] So let me simply say this about our gracious host. Mr. President, the State of Israel has been the cause of your life: through bitter wars and fragile peace, through hardship and prosperity. You've built her. You've cared for her. You've strengthened her. You've nurtured the next generation who will inherit her.
Ben Gurion. Meir. Begin. Rabin. These giants have left us. Only you are with us still: a founding father in our midst. And we are so grateful for your vision, your friendship, but most of all, for your example, including the example of your extraordinary vitality. Every time I see your President, I ask him who his doctor is. [Laughter] We all want to know the secret.
So with gratitude for your life and your service, and as you prepare to celebrate your 90th birthday this summer—and since I'm starting to get pretty good at Hebrew—[laughter]—let me propose a toast, even though you've taken away my wine—[laughter]. Come on. Bring another one.
How are you?
Server. Here you are, sir. You're welcome.
President Obama. A toast. Ad me'ah ve'esrim. L'chaim!
[A toast was offered.]
Mmm, that's good wine. [Laughter] Actually, we should probably get this out of the photograph. All these people will say I'm having too much fun in Israel. [Laughter]
Just a few more words, Mr. President. You mentioned that this medal is presented in recognition of progress toward the ideals of equality and opportunity and justice. But I am mindful that I stand here tonight because of so many others, including the example and the sacrifices of the Jewish people.
In a few days, as we do at every seder, we'll break and hide a piece of matzoh. It's a great way to entertain the kids. Malia and Sasha, even though they are getting older, they still enjoy it. And there are a lot of good places to hide it in the White House. [Laughter] But on a much deeper level, it speaks to the scope of our human experience: how parts of our lives can be broken while other parts can be elusive; how we can never give up searching for the things that make us whole. And few know this better than the Jewish people.
After slavery and decades in the wilderness and with Moses gone, the future of the Israelites was in doubt. But with Joshua as their guide, they pushed on to victory. After the First Temple was destroyed, it seemed Jerusalem was lost. But with courage and resolve, the Second Temple reestablished the Jewish presence. After centuries of persecution and pogroms, the Shoah aimed to eliminate the entire Jewish people. But the gates of the camps flew open; there emerged the ultimate rebuke to hate and to ignorance: Survivors would live and love again.
When the moment of Israel's independence was met by aggression on all sides, it was unclear whether this nation would survive. But with heroism and sacrifice, the State of Israel not only endured, but thrived. And during 6 days in June and Yom Kippur one October, it seemed as though all you had built might be lost. But when the guns fell silent, it was clear: ""The nation of Israel lives.""
As I said in my speech earlier today, this story—from slavery to salvation, of overcoming even the most overwhelming odds—is a message that's inspired the world. And that includes Jewish Americans, but also African Americans, who have so often had to deal with their own challenges, but with whom you have stood shoulder to shoulder.
African Americans and Jewish Americans marched together at Selma and Montgomery, with rabbis carrying the Torah as they walked. They boarded buses for freedom rides together. They bled together. They gave their lives together: Jewish Americans like Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner alongside African American, James Chaney.
Because of their sacrifice, because of the struggle of generations in both our countries, we can come together tonight, in freedom and in security. So if I can paraphrase the Psalm: they turned our mourning into dancing; they changed our sack cloths into robes of joy.
And this evening, I'd like to close with the words of two leaders who brought us some of this joy. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel was born in Poland and lost his mother and sister to the Nazis. He came to America. He raised his voice for social justice. He marched with Martin Luther King. And he spoke of the State of Israel in words that could well describe the struggle for equality in America. ""Our very existence is a witness that man must live toward redemption,"" he said, and ""that history is not always made by man alone.""
Rabbi Joachim Prinz was born in Germany, expelled by the Nazis, and found refuge in America, and he built support for the new State of Israel. And on that August day in 1963, he joined Dr. King at the March on Washington. And this is what Rabbi Prinz said to the crowd:
""In the realm of the spirit, our fathers taught us thousands of years ago that when God created man, he created him as everybody's neighbor. Neighbor is not a geographic concept. It is a moral concept. It means our collective responsibility for the preservation of man's dignity and integrity.""
President Peres, Prime Minister Netanyahu, friends: Our very existence, our presence here tonight, is a testament that all things are possible, even those things that, in moments of darkness and doubt, may seem elusive. The stories of our peoples teach us to never stop searching for the things—the justice and the peace—that make us whole. And so as we go forward together with confidence, we'll know that, while our countries may be separated by a great ocean, in the realm of the spirit, we will always be neighbors and friends.
I very humbly accept this award, understanding that I'm accepting it on behalf of the American people, who are joined together with you.
May God bless you, and may He watch over our two great nations. Thank you very much.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"April 08, 1999","
May I have your attention, please. Can you hear? Ladies and gentlemen, Premier Zhu, Madam Lao, distinguished members of the Chinese delegation; to all of our guests here. And I would like to say a special word of welcome to two special Americans who made an extraordinary effort to be here tonight, Reverend Billy Graham and his wife, Ruth. We thank them for joining us. Thank you very much.
I would like to begin with two profound observations about China. The Chinese civilization has dazzled the world for thousands of years, and the Chinese do not have a tradition of long speeches before dinner. [Laughter] I think there must be a connection. [Laughter] Therefore, I will be brief.
It is not as brief in Chinese as in English. [Laughter]
Since 1784, Chinese and Americans have shared a lively dialog over how to achieve common cause in the countless pursuits that animate great nations. Thomas Jefferson took care to promote what he called ""good dispositions"" between the United States and China. Abraham Lincoln, in his first annual message to Congress, predicted our extensive trade with China. And of course, Franklin Roosevelt made it America's purpose to join with China in defense of freedom.
Our dialog and cooperation have now survived over two centuries and over considerable challenges. Today the Premier and I worked hard to renew both. We spoke to each other with candor and respect about our hopes for our people and our children's future. Sometimes speaking candidly is difficult.
Premier Zhu, I know your own life bears witness to this painful truth. But as you said this morning, only good friends tell each other what they really think. If you're right about that, you have turned out to be quite a good friend, indeed. [Laughter]
As you know, the American people are glad to see you and to return the hospitality you so generously extended to Hillary and me and our delegation last year. People are interested in you. After all, there aren't many leaders who understand both the intricacies of global finance and the intricacies of the Beijing Opera, who play the huqin, a kind of Chinese fiddle, and who voice both blunt political views and blunt musical opinions. For example, this morning's New York Times reported that you said Western opera makes you want to take a nap. [Laughter] I hope Yo Yo Ma understands the pressure on him tonight. [Laughter]
Premier, we have profound respect for your efforts to change China in sweeping ways, to build a 21st century China in which all Chinese have a chance to live full and prosperous lives. Of course, we have some differences over what is required to achieve that goal. And here in America we are still trying, ourselves, to form the ""more perfect Union"" of our Founders' dreams.
But we both believe tomorrow can be better than today, and we believe that our responsibility is to make it so before our brief journeys through life are over.
Last year on March 5th, the Chinese people celebrated the centennial of the birth of the first Premier of the People's Republic, Zhou Enlai. Americans still remember well the man who greeted President Nixon in 1972 and said to him in a toast: ""The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history. We are confident,"" he went on to say, ""that the day will surely come when this common desire of our two peoples will be realized."" Mr. Premier, as Zhou Enlai's successor, you have done much to bring this day closer.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to the Premier of China, Zhu Rongji, Madam Lao, and the people of China.

President Collor and Mr. Vice President, Mr. President of the Senate, Mr. Archbishop, Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies, and Mr. Acting President of the Supreme Court, Minister of Foreign Relations, and Ministers of State, members of the Cabinet, Ambassador and Mrs. Melton, and all you distinguished guests: I am deeply grateful to all of you here and to the people of Brazil for your gracious hospitality.
I fouled this up at lunch, so I want to be sure if we're going to -- are you going to translate it all, or just one part? Okay.
In fact, it won't be easy to leave here. I'm told that one American Ambassador stayed in your country for 21 years -- obviously, a very smart man. I'm here for 24 hours.
But it was a great honor for me to address your Congress this morning. And it was a memorable moment; but more than that, it was, it seemed to me, an affirmation of the proud heritage we share and a reminder that we have much reason for hope in the future.
And again tonight I want to thank the leaders of Congress. And I also want to ad lib here, because I understand I was invited today to go to the Supreme Court. We have great respect in the United States for an independent judiciary. And I am very grateful to the Justices, some of whom are here tonight, that invited me to the Court. And I am only sorry that I did not have the opportunity to take you up on your invitation. But this occasion tonight gives me a chance to salute you, the members of the Court, for whom we have so much respect.
Our two nations have a great deal in common. We put our faith in similar forms of representative government, and we've had Ambassadors in each other's capitals since the earliest years of this century. Our relations have been long; our devotion to freedom, constant; our commitment to peace, enduring. And now I'm convinced that the time has come to move our relations toward a new and higher plane, to eliminate the false schism between what we once called the First and Third Worlds. As President Collor speaks of a Brazil Novo, we should also speak of a new world, defined by its ideals of freedom, democracy, and prosperity shared by all.
All of us in the Americas share a common economic and political vision: an unshakable belief that extraordinary achievements are possible when the imagination and industry of the individual is unleashed. I believe we've just begun to tap the true potentials of the Americas, and it is within our power to bring a new dawn to the New World.
Our Enterprise for the Americas Initiative is a major step forward, helping us explore the many new areas of our common destiny in a spirit of optimism and hope for all peoples of the hemisphere.
Mr. President, you, sir, have courageously resolved to make profound changes in your economy; and I believe that those changes will reap handsome benefits for the people of Brazil, for all the people of Brazil.
We have a common interest in expanding trade and protecting it from the damage that perceived inequities would inflict on our economic partnership. No country would gain if our common policy of an open and fair international trading system isn't fulfilled.
We share common environmental concerns, knowing that the destruction of irreplaceable resources, wherever they're found, compromises mankind's well-being everywhere. I'm confident that we will continue to find shared solutions to global environmental challenges.
Together, our opportunities are boundless, and so let us forge a closer and more vital partnership to ensure lasting prosperity for all our people.
And now I would like to ask you to join me in raising a glass to the health and happiness of the people of Brazil; to our friend and admired President of Brazil, Fernando Collor; and to the friendship between our two great nations. And thank you for an unforgettable visit. Thank you all.

state-dinners,George Bush,"July 18, 1991","
Well, thank you, Mr. President, not only for that warm welcome today, but for those very kind words. And I simply cannot tell you how happy I am to return to Greece -- ""the cradle of democracy"" -- at a time in which ancient principles and modern aspirations meet -- come together.
Some 25 centuries ago, the democratic idea was born right here in Athens. And you kept that idea alive and inspired our Founding Fathers to begin the American experiment. And while this year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of our Bill of Rights, you celebrate the 2,500th anniversary of democratic government.
Mr. President, we speak often of democratic principles and individual liberties and the rule of law. And together, we've stood strong so that democracy would survive in Europe. Greece was among the first countries to resist fascism when you fought Mussolini's army in 1940. And you were also the first to stop Soviet expansionism in Europe after World War II.
And now our North Atlantic alliance supports those same guiding principles, principles that inspire nations all around the world. And today, the human spirit vanquishes the evils of totalitarianism, and the spark of freedom glows brightly in virtually every corner of Europe.
Mr. President, you have played a tremendously important role in preserving the flame of democracy for half a century. And many have stood for democracy, but only a gallant few have risen to the call of reversing autocracy and restoring democratic principles to government and society. And you, sir, are one of those few.
As a matter of fact, you're unsurpassed in that small, very distinguished group. You fought the forces of evil in the Second World War. You fought communism afterward. And you restored democracy to Greece in 1974. Your success in this profound endeavor was a victory for Greece and for the world.
Mr. President, these are brilliant accomplishments. And we pay tribute this evening to your magnificent record as one of the West's great statesmen.
Thucydides wrote that ""the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet, notwithstanding, go out and meet it."" Twice Prime Minister of Greece, and now twice President, you inspire the people of Greece, the people of the United States, and free men and women everywhere.
So, ladies and gentlemen, will you please join me in a toast. To the good fortune of President Karamanlis, to the many times throughout history our two countries have inspired and supported each other, and to the deep friendship -- the real and lasting friendship between our peoples. And may God bless Greeks and the American people as well.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"December 08, 1987","
The President. Mr. General Secretary and Mrs. Gorbachev, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, honored guests: In our public statements and in our meetings together, Mr. General Secretary, we've always paid each other the compliment of candor. So, let us continue to do so. By now, Mr. General Secretary, you may have concluded that while we have fundamental disagreements about how human communities should govern themselves, it's possible, all the same, for us to work together.
As we complete the first full day of this historic meeting, let us look back together at the developments of the past 2 years and the significance of what is taking place. For we find ourselves involved in a dramatic march of events that has captured the attention of our two peoples and the entire world. Since you and I first met in Geneva in November 1985, Mr. General Secretary, our two countries have moved toward a new period in the history of our relations. The highlight of your visit is the signing of the first U.S.-Soviet arms control agreement in nearly a decade—the first ever to mandate actual reductions in our arsenals of nuclear weapons. We're making significant progress in other important areas of arms reduction, and have the opportunity, with mutual commitment and hard work, to achieve much more in the coming months.
But our relationship—the United States and the Soviet Union—is not founded just on arms control but reaches across a broad spectrum of issues. A relationship that addresses the basic problems of self-determination in the areas of regional conflicts and human rights. There are differences here, but ones that require frankness and candor. In bilateral matters, we also need hard and honest debate.
A century-and-a-half ago, the brilliant French observer, de Tocqueville, foresaw that our two countries would be the major countries of the world. History, geography, the blessings of resources, and the hard work of our peoples have made it so. And between us, there has also been a profound competition of political and economic philosophy, making us the protagonists in a drama with the greatest importance for the future of all mankind. Man's most fundamental beliefs about the relationship of the citizen to the state and of man to his creator lie at the core of the competition between our two countries. History has indeed endowed our relationship with a profound meaning.
Certainly we will not settle those issues this week. But the tasks before us require a full awareness of those issues and of a responsibility that is binding on us both. I speak of a responsibility we dare not compromise or shirk. I speak of the responsibility to settle our differences in peace. Already, by virtue of hard work and hard bargaining, we've accomplished much, and our negotiators deserve great credit. But we cannot afford to rest. There is more work to be done, and time and history are marching on.
So, I offer a toast, a commitment on behalf of the American people of seriousness, goodwill, and hope for the future. General Secretary and Mrs. Gorbachev: To your health. Za vashe zdorovye.
The General Secretary. I take power into my hands now, while the President is busy. [Laughter] Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, comrades: Last summer it took a daring American girl by the name of Lynn Cox a mere 2 hours to swim the distance separating our two countries. On television we saw how sincere and cordial the meeting was between our people and the Americans when she stepped onto the Soviet shore. By her courage she showed how close to each other our two peoples live.
Without minimizing the great political and ideological distances between us, we want to seek and find avenues of rapprochement in areas where this is of vital importance for our two countries and for all humankind. That is precisely what we are here for. In my 1986 New Year's Eve address on American television, I spoke of our hopes for a better future. By that time, Mr. President, you and I had already had g days of face-to-face talks in Geneva. This enabled me to tell Americans in my New Year address that the winter of our discontent may one day come to an end. Today, following Reykjavik and the extensive preparatory work that has made our meeting in Washington possible, it can be said that the winter is on the wane.
A boundless world stretches far and wide beyond the walls of this house. And you and I, if you will, are accountable to it and to the peoples of our two countries, to our allies and friends and to all our contemporaries. The Russian word, perestroika, can be applied to the process now underway all over the world of rethinking the realities of a nuclear and space age. It must now be clear to all that the problems of today's world will not be solved through old approaches. The goal we are setting today is to build a nuclear-free world. The road leading to it is difficult and thorny, but with new thinking it is attainable. As you can see, here, too, changes are necessary-changes in the minds and changes in actions.
The great age of geographical discoveries amounted to more than one caravel or one newly found continent. Our journey toward a nuclear-free world cannot amount to reaching one or two islands named INF and shorter range INF. It is my hope that we shall promptly move further ahead toward the goal of reducing and then eliminating strategic offensive arms which make up the main and decisive portion of the nuclear arsenal.
As the clock of life brings us closer and closer to the gist century, we are duty bound to remember that each one of us, within the limits of our capability and ability, personifies the link between the transient and the eternal. As our famous poet Afanasiy Fet, said, ""Although man is not eternal, what is human is eternal."" It is in the name of eternal humanity that we have today performed our momentous deed.
And my first salute is to that event. It will be cherished by our two peoples. So, I address these words of congratulation to the Soviet and American people whose will is embodied in the agreement. I want to emphasize that this is the fruit of the efforts not only of us both but also of our allies and representatives of all countries and all public movements whose effort and contribution rightfully make them parties to this historic event.
It would be fair today to pay tribute to the efforts of those who were directly involved in preparing the treaty. May I wish good health to you, Mr. President, and to Mrs. Reagan; happiness and well-being to all those present here tonight; peace and prosperity to the peoples of our two countries.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 05, 1985","
President and Mrs. von Weizsacker, Chancellor and Mrs. Kohl, honored guests, Nancy and I want to thank you for your warm and gracious hospitality. Our visit to the Federal Republic of Germany has been a wonderful and enriching experience. Today was especially moving. We cannot fully understand the long road we've all traveled since 1945 unless we remember the beginnings. By standing before mass graves at a spot such as Bergen-Belsen, we could begin—but only begin—to feel the suffering of so many innocent people and to sense the horror which confronted our leaders 40 years ago. And by joining Chancellor Kohl in Bitburg, we could better understand the price paid by the German people for the crimes of the Third Reich.
Today, as 40 years ago, the thought uppermost in our minds must remain: Never again. You, Mr. President, embody the values which we're working to protect today. Your distinguished career in business and politics, your engagement in church affairs, are exemplary. Over the years, Americans have been especially moved by our ability to articulate the soul of the German nation. You have been eloquent in your message of sorrow over Germany's historic burdens. You've been inspiring in your offer of hope. I remember so vividly my visit to the great city of Berlin in 1982. Your achievement in restoring confidence and hope to democracy's city was a service to the entire West.
The camaraderie of this evening, the good will that we've enjoyed, reflect the deep and abiding friendship between our two peoples, an affection that overcame the bitterness of war. The passage penned by Schiller in ""Wilhelm Tell"" says, ""What's old collapses, times change and new life blossoms in the ruins."" Forty years ago, our friendship blossomed in the ruins. Today the bond between us is a powerful force for good, improving the material well-being of our peoples, helping keep us at peace, and protecting our freedom. In this year, studded with anniversaries, let us remember to celebrate the beginning of friendship as well as the end of war.
You, Mr. President, and Chancellor Kohl have been among the most thoughtful spokesmen for the spirit of the Federal Republic. Through you we've experienced the warmth and depth of German-American solidarity. By working together as friends and allies we have accomplished more than any visionary could have predicted.
Europe has enjoyed 40 years of peace. This did not just happen by chance. Peace has been the outcome of decisions made by individuals with the wisdom to see what was needed and the courage to do it. Chancellor Kohl, I understand and appreciate how difficult it was for you to stand firm and refuse to back away from the decision to modernize NATO's nuclear deterrent. By moving forward we balanced off the threat created by the massive Soviet buildup of the last decade and gave substance to our arms reduction talks in Geneva.
What we seek in Geneva is an agreement which will permit us to reduce significantly the size of nuclear arsenals. For too long we have lived in the shadow of nuclear destruction. The United States is now moving forward with a research program which could offer a way to diminish the threat of nuclear annihilation. I hope that the Federal Republic will join us in this effort to find ways to enhance deterrence based on protection instead of retaliation, on systems capable of destroying attacking missiles but incapable of threatening people.
Today, very appropriately, marks the 30th anniversary of the Federal Republic's entry into NATO. As always, our collective effort will be founded on one simple truth: NATO threatens no one; NATO protects the peace.
It's especially fitting that on this the anniversary of the end of a worldwide conflagration that the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies met here in the Federal Republic to exchange ideas on economic issues and matters of state. As individuals elected by the people to represent their values as well as their interests, our good will and cooperation reflect the highest aspirations of the free people of this planet. The freedom our peoples have enjoyed in these last four decades has opened the door to a future in which our potential will be limited only by our imagination. The free people of the world, especially here in the Federal Republic and in the United States, stand together on the edge of this new era, a time of space stations, conquering diseases, and great leaps in the standard of living for all mankind.
Ahead of us may be a time when the artificial barriers that divide Germany, and indeed all Europe, are cast away, a time when there will be no need for weapons or barbed wire or walls in Berlin.
These are not dreams. I believe from the bottom of my heart we have every reason for confidence. The future is on the side of the free. The Federal Republic and the United States have proven that. Our 40 years of friendship are reason enough to rejoice, but let us look to the next 40 years, to the freedom and peace our children and their children will enjoy, to the boundless progress they will make, and to the friendship between Germany and the United States, which will serve them well just as it has served us.
Let me then offer a toast to the many friends gathered here tonight and especially to our shared future. To the President, to Germany, to America, and to freedom throughout Europe.

Mr. President and Mrs. Musharraf and distinguished guests, Laura and I thank you for the warm and gracious welcome. It's such a pleasure to be here in Pakistan. We've had a fantastic day. I was fooled by a googly. [Laughter] Otherwise, I'd have been a better batsman. But it's been a full day, Mr. President, and your hospitality has overwhelmed us, and thank you.
I bring greetings from my fellow citizens, in particular the thousands of Pakistani Americans who call my land home, folks who have really made a tremendous contribution to the United States of America.
Our nations are strong allies, Mr. President. We're allies in the war on terror, and we're allies in laying the foundation of lasting peace. In the struggle in the war on terror, Pakistan and America has lost many good citizens. And we ask for God's blessings on their families. Pakistan's efforts to enhance peace and security have earned the respect and the admiration of the American people. When the terrorists are defeated and when the peace is won, our two nations will share the peace together.
The American people care deeply about the people of Pakistan. We watched with horror and great sorrow as last year's earthquake devastated this ancient land. Americans have experienced the trauma of natural disasters in our own country, and we've witnessed the power of friendship to rebuild lives and to restore hope. I'm proud of the U.S. relief efforts. I want to thank those officials who are here to help the people of Pakistan.
I'm pleased that our helicopters earned the name ""angels of mercy"" from those who were anxious for help in the mountains. I'm proud that our Government and businesses and private organizations and individual families also saw your need and gave their time and treasures to help rebuild this vital nation. Our donations reflect the compassion of our country, the respect we have for Pakistan. And we will make good on our donations, Mr. President.
America and Pakistan have confronted great challenges together, and we will continue to do so. Americans will support the Pakistani people as they take further steps toward democracy, expand educational opportunities for boys and girls, and create prosperity through innovation and global trade. Pakistan has a bright future because of its proud people and because of the hard work of a strong leader. President Musharraf, you've proved yourself to be a man of courage and vision. I appreciate the honor of being your partner in working for peace and security.
And so, Mr. President, with gratitude for what we've accomplished and with optimism for what we will yet accomplish, I offer my respect to you, to your gracious wife, and to the people of Pakistan.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"September 30, 1970","
Mr. President, Madame Broz, friends of Yugoslavia and the United States:
I am honored to be the first American President to visit Yugoslavia; and on this occasion, before this very distinguished company, with this beautiful banquet, I wish, Mr. President, to extend to you and to Madame Broz an invitation to visit our country again.
You have seen Washington and New York. But we would like for you to come again to Washington and then to see the Midwest and our State of California. Both areas are very proud to have many citizens of Yugoslav background who will give you a very warm welcome. We look forward to your visit to the United States.
Tonight, I think, after hearing you speak, Mr. President, of the many things our countries have in common--you have referred to some of them--l, of course, think first of the many Americans whose roots are here in Yugoslavia, personal friends that Mrs. Nixon and I have, for example, in California, and who have contributed so much to the life of our country.
Beyond this, both of our nations take pride in our diversity. Each of our societies is made up of people of diverse ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Yet in each of our countries they have joined together to form one great, strong nation.
Both of our nations have worked to reconcile regional diversity and national harmony within our countries. Now we must be leaders in reconciling national diversity and international harmony elsewhere in the world.
I think, too, of the steadfast independence, the courage, the love of freedom that are so much a part of the Yugoslav spirit and the Yugoslav strength, and of the times each of our nations has fought to preserve its freedom and its independence.
I think of the efforts Yugoslavia is making to help other nations, and of those places in the less developed parts of the world where our experts, your experts and ours, have worked side by side to assist with development programs.
I think of the exciting new industrial ventures that are being undertaken or planned here in Yugoslavia, in which Americans and Yugoslavs are investing together in the future of Yugoslavia, working together, to develop new enterprises.
I think also on an occasion like this of the great importance of the changes that have taken place in the world in the past 25 years, and of what those changes make possible in terms of a new structure of stability and mutual respect among nations.
A quarter of a century after World War II, we do live in a new world, a world of new nations, of altered relationships, of greater experience, and of new opportunities to strengthen that structure of orderly procedures of mutual respect that is the foundation of peace.
Even in this new world, we still confront many of the same old problems, but often in a new form.
The problem of European security still is high on the world's agenda. Yugoslavia has tried to demonstrate to the rest of Europe the basic truth that true security must rest on a firm foundation of mutual respect for the independence and integrity of all European countries and of noninterference in their internal affairs.
This same principle lies at the heart of our policies, and there could be no better example of it than the relationship that we have developed with each other and that you have sought to develop with your neighbors, far and near, on this continent.
Long ago Yugoslavia made a decision. It chose the path of nonalignment, and for more than two decades Yugoslavia and you, Mr. President, have personally played major roles in the nonaligned movement throughout the world. We in the United States respect that position.
But the great question today is not whether a nation is aligned or nonaligned, but whether it respects the rights of others to choose their own paths, and Yugoslavia, by its example, has given heart to those who would choose their own paths. The great goal that we share in this decade is the building of a stable and a lasting peace. This far transcends differences in ideology, in geography, or in systems of internal order.
It is toward this end that we in the United States are seeking to put an end to the crises and confrontations that have plagued the postwar world.
In our relations with the Soviet Union, we are prepared to discuss the requirements of a stable strategic relationship and a limit on the deadly competition in nuclear arms.
In Europe, we are prepared to join with others in helping overcome the division in this continent, at reducing the military confrontations, at developing a full range of economic, cultural, and human contacts with each of the nations in Europe.
We respect the legitimate interests of others, including those interests that relate to their security. But we do not accept doctrines by which one power purports to abridge the right of other countries to shape their own destinies and to pursue their own legitimate interests. Every nation, large or small, has the duty to maintain its own security; but no nation has the right to do so by infringing on the security of others.
You can be our friend without being anyone else's enemy.
The pursuit of ""total security"" by one nation can only lead to the insecurity of others and, therefore, it will not bring order and peace.
Our sole objective in the Middle East, in Vietnam, and all other areas of the world is to help insure that people and nations will live in peace and be able to build their own lives in accordance with their own aspirations with due regard for those of others.
We oppose policies by powers outside the region that are designed to gain unilateral advantage or paramount influence.
Building a true peace requires more than coping with wars and the threat of wars. We recognize, as Yugoslavia does, that we cannot have true peace if many of the world's nations are frozen permanently into a ""have-not"" status. That is why we shall continue to help others who need help--and we welcome the efforts of Yugoslavia toward that same end.
As we look to the remaining decades of this century, as we attempt to plan for what Europe has not had, and America has not had, thus far in this century, a full generation of peace, it is this pattern of mutual respect among nations, of respect for their right to independence, their right to choose their own way, their right to live without interference from their neighbors, whether large or small--it is these rights that we must preserve, that we must protect.
In politics, in the arts, in the development of its economy, and the life-styles of its people, in its distribution of rights and responsibilities, Yugoslavia has pursued its own national model. And this is what national independence means: the right of each nation, of each people, to pursue its own chosen destiny in its own way, limited only by its recognition of the fact that every other nation has that same right.
And so I ask all of you to join me in a toast to President Tito, whose courage, whose determination, whose independence, have been an example to the world, and also to the principles of mutual respect for which he stands, for which Yugoslavla stands, and which embody the hope of the world for a true and a lasting peace.
Zivila [Long live] Yugoslavia; ziveo [long live] President Tito.

Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Privy Counselors, Prime Minister, members of the Cabinet, the diplomatic corps, distinguished guests: The First Lady and I are deeply honored by the welcome we have received in Thailand. We are proud to visit during the year that celebrates His Majesty's 50th year on the throne.
We Americans claim a special connection with His Majesty because he was born in Massachusetts, where his father was studying at Harvard and his mother was a student at Simmons College. And of course, I feel a particular admiration for His Majesty, whose love of music, especially jazz, and whose skill on the saxophone are universally renowned. In his lifetime, the late Duke Ellington was called the King of Jazz. Now it seems to me that His Majesty can lay legitimate and literal claim to that title.
Our stay here, Your Majesty, is far too brief. But we have had time to appreciate the wonder of your country. Hillary saw it when she visited two northern provinces and shared the enchanting beauty of the ceremony of Loy Kraphong. We both have marveled at Bangkok, the City of Angels, where we see both the proud traditions of the past and the shining promise of the future.
Your Majesty, when you addressed the United States Congress 36 years ago, you noted that for all the distance that divides our people, still one thing unites us, the love of freedom. You were right then, and you are right today. Thailand's struggles for liberty at home and abroad have inspired nations all over the world. Thailand is one of our oldest friends and strongest allies. The treaty the United States signed with the Kingdom of Siam in 1833 was the very first treaty forged by our young Nation with any Asian nation.
In the last half-century we have fought side by side in Korea and Vietnam. We have stood together in promoting security in this region and around the world. Our nations have been partners in prosperity as well. And now we are working to build a new Pacific community where open societies, linked and invigorated by open markets, give their people the tools, the confidence, the opportunity to make the most of their own lives.
Your Majesty, Thailand's growing role on the global stage is a fitting tribute to your leadership. You have guided Thailand through political crises. You have helped to secure a climate in which democracy can flourish. Your tireless efforts, and Her Majesty's, to advance rural development have been a model for all the world. Your integrity and devotion to your people has made you a symbol of unity and pride. To me it was especially telling that when your country's Olympic boxer won Thailand's first-ever gold medal this year in Atlanta, he strode triumphantly around the ring with a framed picture of you. So in celebrating our nations' partnership, we celebrate you as well.
Your Majesty, our great author Somerset Maugham once said as he gazed at this marvelous palace complex, ""It makes you laugh with delight to think that anything so fantastic could exist on this somber Earth."" So here, amid the brilliant colors, the heavenly spires of this wonderful place, the friendship between our people springs forth more vibrantly than ever.
Therefore, I ask that all of you join me in a toast to that friendship, to our alliance, and to long life for His Majesty, the King.

Good evening, and welcome to the White House. Tonight it's my pleasure to return the hospitality that was extended to us by President Li during our visit to China. And I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to develop a personal relationship with him. And it's my honor, President Li, to greet you affectionately as lao pengyou. Now, for most of you who don't speak Chinese, that means ""old friend."" [Laughter]
Today when President Li and I renewed our friendship, he expressed his wishes for my full recovery. In fact, he told me that once I was totally back on my feet, a young man like myself could expect to have a long and distinguished career ahead of him. [Laughter] President Li comes from a nation whose people are known for their traditional respect for the elders. President Li, I can assure you I'm doing my best to reestablish that tradition in our own country. [Laughter]
But I learned about that and many other wonderful aspects of China during our visit last year. Although our stay was brief, I did, as the Chinese say, ""look at the flowers while riding horseback""—capturing lasting impressions not only of the magnificence of the culture and the land but also the bold vision of those directing China's future.
The progress we've made is a tribute to individuals with courage and foresight, like President Li, on both sides of the Pacific. The relationship we've built improves the material well-being and increases the security of our countries. Areas of disagreement exist; these should not be ignored, nor should they be permitted to inhibit us from acting together in these many areas of commonality. Historic truths determine our fundamental national interests, and they continue to draw our two peoples together.
After our meeting today, I'm happy to say I remain confident that Chinese-American cooperation will grow and strengthen in the years ahead. Underscoring the momentum of our relationship, I am delighted tonight to announce that the Chinese Government has invited Vice President Bush to China and that he has accepted this most gracious invitation. Such visits as yours, Mr. President, elevate the relationship of the leaders of our two nations, enhance our joint efforts, and open new doors of cooperation.
President Li, by the time you return home you will have seen much of the United States and met many Americans in and out of government. You will have seen our industry, our people, and our land. We Americans came here from almost every nation, including China, to an undeveloped land, a wilderness. We're proud of what we've accomplished. And today we're proud to stand beside the people of China, who are striving to build a better life.
By working together, we can and will create a more prosperous and peaceful world. So, let us drink a toast to that and to President Li and Madame Lin, his wife.

Thank you, Your Majesty, for your warm and gracious welcome. Thanks also to Her Majesty the Queen for hosting this event. I thank as well the Grand Chamberlain who earlier today led us on a tour of the magnificent Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Laura and I have been seeing the famous hospitality of the Thai people, and we are most grateful.
The United States of America deeply values our alliance with the Kingdom of Thailand. Your Majesty, the world has changed greatly since your reign began 57 years ago. Yet thanks to your enlightened leadership and steady hand, the friendship between our two nations has remained constant.
Over the decades, we worked together to build the foundations of liberty in this region, rule of law, respect for human rights, free enterprise, and peace. Today, we continue to strive toward the same goals in the face of different challenges. Nations are working together in Afghanistan and Iraq. Royal Thai troops have served well in both places, helping Afghans and Iraqis make the transition from tyranny to self-government.
The emergence of these free nations is a setback for terrorism and radicalism. By sharing the duties of our coalition, Thailand is contributing to peace and stability in those two countries and increasing the security of all free nations.
Thailand has played a vital role in East Timor, helping create a new nation to bring dignity to nearly a million people and to stabilize an entire region. You are fully joined in the fight against the drug trade and against HIV/AIDS and other diseases.
Thailand is a principled, generous nation, rising to meet the challenges of our time. Thailand's positive influence in the world is inspired by the fine example of service that Your Majesty and Her Majesty the Queen set for your people. It's also vivid in the great, humane traditions of this land. America is honored to have your friendship.
So I offer a toast to Your Majesties, to the royal family, and to your great nation.

Good evening. President Jiang, Mrs. Wang, members of the Chinese delegation, Ambassador and Mrs. Sasser, distinguished guests, friends all, Hillary and I welcome you to America's house.
Mr. President, in your lifetime you have witnessed the sweep of a remarkable century, both in China and abroad. And in your different occupations, you have lived a rich sampling of the human enterprise. While you lead China toward the future, we know you also are a student of the past, with an interest in our history, from Thomas Jefferson to Mark Twain. Not many heads of state can recite the Gettysbury Address, Mr. Lincoln's powerful hymn to the sanctity of our Union and our guarantee of freedom.
China has played an important role in our history. In 1784, shortly after America's independence, the first American merchant ship landed in China. The Chinese officials knew we were not European, so they simply called us the ""new people."" And though we were unfamiliar, the Chinese allowed us to trade freely with them. So one of the oldest societies on Earth, China, extended the hand of friendship to the world's youngest nation.
The two centuries since then are a tiny fraction of recorded Chinese history. Long before the United States was even born, China was a stronghold of creativity, knowledge, and wealth. From the printing China invented to the poetry it produced, from medicine and mathematics to the magnetic compass and humanistic philosophies, many of China's earliest gifts still enrich our lives today.
Now, the Chinese people are dramatically building on this legacy. Economic reform over the past 20 years has transformed China's landscape and its people's daily lives, lifting millions from poverty, giving more people education, shelter, choice of work, and a chance to provide for their children, bringing the Chinese people closer to the rest of the world and into a greater leadership role in the community of nations.
Now, on the verge of the new century, both our nations seek to continue this progress, to contribute to China's growing prosperity, to encourage its democratic development, to support its emergence as a responsible global power and partner.
Surely a new world is dawning on the other side of the millennium. From Shanghai to San Francisco, a community is emerging that can become ""Pacific"" in every sense of the word. Communication and commerce cross even the world's widest ocean in only a matter of seconds, making all of us neighbors.
Let us make the most of these new realities. Our commercial and cultural relationship is strong and growing stronger. Our people travel back and fourth, teaching and learning from each other. Mr. President, we Americans are proud that your son received a part of his education at one of our universities, and we want more of our young people to study in China. We want to work even more closely to promote peace, to fight drugs and organized crime, to build prosperity, to protect our environment for future generations.
We must press ahead on these fronts and more. I hope some day, Mr. President, the children of both our nations will say of us that our decision gave new meaning in our time to President Lincoln's call for a new birth of freedom. The United States has benefited already beyond measure from the contributions of Chinese-Americans, whose unique culture and values of family, education, and hard work have strengthened the fabric of our society. Already, China has enriched America's history. Now, Mr. President, let us work together with confidence to enhance our common destiny.
The ancient text, the ""I Ching,"" in English is called ""The Book of Changes."" It tells us leaders plan in the beginning when they do things; leaders consider problems and prevent them. With this summit we have considered problems, taken steps to prevent some of them, and we have begun to plan together for a future not of problems but of progress for America, for China, for the world.
It is in that spirit that I ask you to join me in a toast to the people and the President of the People's Republic of China.

Ladies and gentlemen, President Yeltsin, Mrs. Yeltsin, distinguished guests: It is a great pleasure for Hillary and I to welcome Boris and Naina and all the Russian delegation to the White House. We're glad for this opportunity to return the generous hospitality that you bestowed on us in Moscow last January at the magnificent state dinner in the Kremlin's Hall of Facets and St. George's Hall. It was a magnificent evening that brought home to me, to Hillary, and to all the Americans there the vast richness of Russian culture.
Mr. President, our fellow Americans know you as the man who has led one of the most peaceful and hopeful revolutions of our time, the second Russian revolution. We were all inspired when you stood up for freedom in the streets of Moscow. And we have admired your patient, persistent, and successful efforts to build the institutions of democracy.
We know reform has been difficult, and there is a hard road yet to travel. But as I said this morning when you arrived at the White House, you have already proved the pessimists wrong. Under your leadership, Russia is coming together and moving forward. Her best days are still to come. And we are proud of our partnership with your great country.
At one of our previous meetings you were kind enough to give me a copy of your autobiography. It's a remarkable story, a story still in progress, of a man dedicated and determined to give his fellow Russians the opportunity to reach their full potential. I know there are many more volumes yet to be written, but one part of your book made a particular impression on me.
In your autobiography you tell the story of your father's ambition to invent a brick-laying machine. Time and again, he would describe in intricate detail how it would work, how it would mix mortar, lay the bricks, clean off the excess mortar, and move on to keep building. He had all sorts of sketches and calculations for this machine, which he believed would better the lives of the Russian people.
Mr. President, you have realized your father's dream, and on a scale he could never have imagined. Brick by brick, through your tireless and steadfast efforts, you have laid the foundation for a democratic Russia. Your nation has now an elected President and Parliament, a Constitution, an increasingly free economy, and an open society. In just a few short years, you have accomplished the work of a lifetime.
And so it is with great admiration for your historic achievements, confidence in our new partnership, and a belief that working together we will help to make a better world, that I, and I ask all of you to join me, in raising a glass to you, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, President of the Russian Federation.

It's my honor to offer a toast to the— our guests from Mexico. After I do so, President Fox will offer a toast, and then Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles, California, will offer to bless the meal.
Mr. President and Mrs. Fox, on behalf of the American people, Laura and I welcome you to the United States and to the Casa Blanca. [Laughter]
This is not only a state dinner; it's like a family gathering. The most important ties between your country and mine, Mr. President, go beyond economics and politics and geography. They are the ties of heritage, culture, and family. This is true for millions of Mexican and American families, including my own.
The Mexican people have changed and enriched America. Together, our nations are now working to strengthen the Americas. A long border lies between us, but it does not divide us. Nearly one million people cross that border every day; a quarter-trillion dollars worth of trade crosses it every year. Because of the visionary NAFTA agreement of 1994, the trade between us crosses in ever greater freedom. That's a benefit to both our peoples and a model to the world.
A sound foreign policy begins by ensuring the safety and security of the neighborhood we share. A good neighborhood is made by good neighbors. And good neighbors work as we are working, with shared obligations and mutual respect.
Mr. President, you and I are keeping the pledges we made in Guanajuato this past winter to expand the freedom of trade, to build an equitable prosperity, and to honor the rule of law.
We have before us a great prospect, an era of prosperity in a hemisphere of liberty. In this task, our cooperation is broad and unprecedented. Our sense of trust is strong, and it's growing.
A century and a half ago, another occupant of this house, Abraham Lincoln, paused in the darkest hour of this country's history to send a word of hope to Mexico. Lincoln knew how closely the fates of our two countries were linked. And he never lost faith in the character of our two people. In April of 1861, he directed his Secretary of State to tell Mexico of his high respect for the heroism of their people, and above all, their inextinguishable love of civil liberty.
My message to the Mexican people is the same. The respect of my Nation endures, and it deepens. The United States has no more important relationship in the world than our relationship with Mexico. Each of our countries is proud of our independence, our freedom, and our democracy. We are united by values and carried forward by common hopes.
And so, Mr. President, speaking friend to friend, partner to partner, neighbor to neighbor, I offer a toast to you, to your gracious wife, and to your great nation.

[The President's remarks are joined in progress.]
It is a real honor for us to welcome you. Our two nations are old friends and natural partners. We both emerged from a colonial past to become free nations. We stood together during the cold war, opposing imperial communism. Today, we stand together against the forces of terror and in the defense of human dignity.
We both understand the danger and cost of terrorism. It has brought damage to both our economies and grief to both our nations. With us tonight are two women who suffered terribly on August 7, 1998. Susan Hirsch lost her husband, Abdulrahman Mohamed Abdulla, a Kenyan citizen, in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. And Susan Bartley lost her husband, Julian, our U.S. Consul General, and her son, Jay, when the terrorists struck our Embassy in Nairobi. Both of you are honored guests here tonight, and we honor as well the memory of your loved ones.
America and Kenya are committed to the war on terror, and we seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror. Kenya is finding what America has found, that democracy and liberty and free markets are honorable and just and indispensable to real progress. The challenges of freedom are real; yet the benefits of freedom are great and everlasting.
There is a Swahili proverb which says, ""Forever persist; a rope can cut stone."" Kenya and its leaders have been persistent and courageous in the cause of freedom. You're resolved in the fight against terror. Kenya is an example to all of Africa and a respected partner of America.
For all these reasons, Mr. President, I'm pleased to offer a toast to the enduring friendship between Kenya and the United States of America.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"October 07, 1980","
PRESIDENT CARTER. I can already tell that this is going to be a delightful evening, because there's kind of a spirit of friendship and excitement in the guests that we've had here at the White House. The reason for that is that we've got a great new leader of a wonderful new democracy who's come here representing one of the largest and most influential democracies in the entire world.
I've been trying to find something where I was better than he was to make me feel better tonight. He's younger than I am. I thought he was born in 1924, he's born in 1925. I've got four children, he's got nine children. [Laughter] And he's got 3 more years to serve in this term, I've only got a few more months to serve in this term. [Laughter] I grow peanuts; he told me he grows ground-nuts on his farm, which is a much more all-pervasive worldwide name for the same genus. And I'm very delighted that we've already had a chance to get acquainted and to become, I believe, at least embryonic personal friends.
We have as a guest tonight a man who represents a great nation, 80 million freedom-loving people committed to free elections and democracy, the end of racial discrimination throughout the continent of Africa, a nation committed to peace, a nation like ours blessed by God with great natural resources, the nation of Nigeria, committed to preserving those resources for the benefit in perpetuity of the people who look to him for leadership, a nation which has had an unbelievable transformation from a military regime, under General Obasanjo and his Cabinet, whom I know very well, in the most generous and constructive change that I have ever known in politics, where they all voluntarily committed themselves not to seek further office, but let the people of the nation choose through free and unrestrained elections a civilian government. And none of those former leaders who did such a superb job for Nigeria were willing or able through their own self-imposed constraints to serve in the new government. It's an exciting thing to see the spread of democracy and the spread of influence of this great, new nation throughout the continent of Africa and indeed the entire world.
Obviously, there is a need for exchange of ideas. The first official visit that an American President ever made to a nation in Africa was made when I visited Liberia and Nigeria in April of 1978. I visited Nigeria first, and it was not an accident that I chose Nigeria in all the 50 or more nations in the continent of Africa to express our country's new commitment to the interests and the importance of the continent of Africa, which had been neglected too long by my predecessors who've lived in this house.
Later, indeed this year, Vice President Mondale made a return visit to Lagos. He was received with hospitality and warmth. And then following that we had a very constructive economic mission who went to Lagos to explore new ways that we could share in a partnership fashion the economic development and the innovations that can benefit all of our people by this close cooperation in trade and commerce. And only 2 weeks ago my science and technology adviser, Dr. Frank Press, went back to Nigeria to explore ways where new ideas can be used to benefit the lives of both our peoples.
We have literally thousands of young Nigerian students who come to our universities. This is a further tie that binds the people of these two great nations together. I think, perhaps, more important of all though is the spirit that permeates the consciousness of the people, a spirit dedicated to freedom, a spirit dedicated to democracy, a spirit dedicated to deep religious convictions and the right of each person to choose his or her own religion, a spirit that permeates the consciousness that a human being is a precious thing in the eyes of God, and that government has a responsibility and a duty to enhance the worth of that individual and to let whatever talents that person might have be expanded.
The President of Nigeria, who's our honored guest tonight, along with one of the most distinguished delegations that has ever come to our country, is a man of great experience in government. He's also a farmer who loves the earth and sees in his country the tremendous potential for the future of greater production of food and fiber and things that are good for people in a peaceful way. And he's also a teacher, he's also an author, and he's also a poet. A man of ideas and a man of action. So, in many ways, this is an exciting evening which is important to us all.
Nigeria is now using its tremendous economic and political influence throughout the continent of Africa to promote stability and to honor international boundaries, but to let the aspirations which are legitimate among people who have been too long suffering from suppression and discrimination be realized. And to promote majority rule and to promote the end of apartheid and the end of racial discrimination is a deep commitment of the people of Nigeria which we share.
There's never been any equivocation in my own administration about a common approach to these concepts of the enhancement of freedom and the enhancement of the worth of individual human beings.
And finally, I'd like to say that we have worked together very closely. It wasn't very many months before I became President in the previous administration here that the borders of Nigeria were closed to the Secretary of State of our country. But we've opened those borders and those arms of friendship in a mutually beneficial way across the ocean, and we have worked together to promote majority rule and democracy and independence of Zimbabwe. And we're now working to realize the same aspirations in Namibia cooperating closely. And throughout South Africa we're working to end apartheid and to see this same concept that's been exemplified in Zimbabwe under Prime Minister Mugabe extended to all people who live there.
And finally, let me say that as a leader in the Organization of African Unity, President Shagari and the people of Nigeria have a great reason to be proud. One top official in the OAU said that Nigeria acts as an umbrella over the continent of Africa to realize the finest aspirations of all people who live there. And I'm very glad to raise my glass in a toast tonight to the man who holds that umbrella and who exemplifies to the utmost degree the qualities and aspirations of the people who he leads.
I'd like to ask you all to rise and join me in a toast: to President Shagari, to the great and free and independent and democratic nation of Nigeria, and to the people who join with us in friendship and in peace to the promotion in the finest way of human rights for all. Mr. President.
PRESIDENT SHAGARI. President Carter and Mrs. Carter, Vice President Mondale and Mrs. Mondale, Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
It is 1 year since I was in an electioneering campaign, and you are, Mr. President, now in a period of election, which from my own experience, I know, is a period which is a very busy period. And the fact that you can spare the time to meet us and entertain us, I, more than anybody else, know that it is a great sacrifice, and it is done in your love to Africa and to Nigeria, which we greatly appreciate.
I feel highly honored to be your special guest, and I want to take this opportunity to thank you, Mr. President, your Government, and the people of the United States for the wonderful hospitality accorded to me and my entourage since our arrival in your great country. The toast which you have proposed to me and to my country is an expression of the deep and true friendship that has always existed between our two countries.
We in Nigeria, indeed, I daresay in all Africa, welcome and value this friendship with your country, a friendship which we have consistently enjoyed since the beginning of your administration. Before your time Africa and African affairs did not receive adequate and positive American attention as a matter of official policy. While it is true to say that African leaders have always been welcomed to the White House, it is also a fact that you, Mr. President, are the first American President to make an unprecedented visit to Nigeria, in the spring of 1978. Your state visit, which was in return for the visit of my predecessor, General Obasanjo, whom you received in this same gracious setting, is a landmark in the friendly relations between our two peoples.
These and other activities between our two countries reflect your commitment not only to seek to understand us better but also to build a very strong bond of friendship and cooperation between our two countries. In that way Nigeria and the United States have come to treat each other with the deserving respect and now cooperate in the material advantage of our two peoples.
Our relationship is one which is based on interdependence. The friendship which characterizes it has made it possible for us to maximize those advantages that are derivable from it. We have, for example, set up the machinery of bilateral economic cooperation between our two Governments to provide the framework within which contacts at various levels in the public and private sectors of the economy will be facilitated. Our population of some 80 million people needs to be fed, housed, educated, and provided with good medical services to enable us to engage unhindered in the task of nation-building. Also, we know that your country is the biggest and most advanced producer of food in the world. We will, therefore, need expertise and investment by your people in our green revolution, to which my administration attaches the greatest importance and has devoted substantial proportion of our resources.
In addition, we take this opportunity to invite your planners, architects, and engineers to collaborate with their Nigerian counterparts to plan, design, and construct low-cost housing for our people. We will welcome, in short, American participation and partnership in the national development, as we have welcomed other countries. The combination of American technology and our own resources and manpower will enable us to contribute our output to the challenge of providing the material needs of our people. Massive American investment in the relevant areas of our development programs, apart from having many other advantages for our own two countries, will be yet another method to reverse the payment deficit which the U.S. now runs in its trade with Nigeria. I know that this is a matter of considerable importance to you, Mr. President, and all Americans.
Mr. President, the voluntary return of the Nigerian armed forces to their milltap/ function and the assumption of power by democratically elected government both guarantee an atmosphere of stable government security and security for those who may wish to come to our country. Our laws in this regard are fair and the most likely to assure mutual satisfaction and political stability.
Mr. President, we in Nigeria realize clearly that in order to achieve our goal of national development we need an atmosphere of international peace and security. The United States is one of the superpowers of this world whose actions help to determine the future of mankind. It is for this reason that we have watched with great interest and concern the fortunes of your talks with other superpowers in respect of nuclear disarmament and the control of strategic arms. Indeed, we applauded your efforts in the conclusion of the SALT II treaty last year, because we believe that mankind deserves to live without the fear of nuclear annihilation and that the treaty was one positive step towards freedom from nuclear holocaust. We are your friends and we trust that you will not relent in your efforts to save us this anxiety.
The fear of nuclear catastrophe, dreadful as it may be to contemplate, is not only our main concern. The yawning gap between the North and the South cannot fail to demand our prime attention, because in spite of our oil resources we belong to the Third World.
My friends, this is not the time to bother you with data on economic control of the wealth of the world by developed nations, data of deprivation of essentials of life in the South, data on the staggering rise in death through famine and starvation, data on the soaring number of refugees in Africa and other parts of the world, and endless data of procrastinations and refusals on the part of developed countries to respond to calls from the poor South to come to meaningful agreements. However, I feel this is an opportune moment for me to call on America, an influential voice in the North, for a rethink on the matter which poses a real threat to the stability of the world if not arrested.
For those of us gathered here tonight we must realize that failure to act meaningfully to correct this economic imbalance between the two worlds may mean the loss of democracy and human rights as we know them in this part of the world. I believe America has the will and the capacity to lead the rest of the. North in coming to an understanding of the developing countries. It is in your best interest to lead the way be opening up to the demands of the developing countries. On the other hand, the message should also go out to our friends in Eastern Europe that they need to ensure this world stability by extending substantial development aids to the developing countries. To argue, as they have done in the past, that they were never colonial powers and therefore unable to enter meaningful dialog is nothing but an escapist posture.
Another equally pressing problem is that of racism, which you have mentioned, Mr. President. The problems of colonialism and apartheid in southern Africa from the beginning—I have to say that I am particularly pleased with the fact that the efforts of our two countries contributed immensely to the final liberation of Zimbabwe. However, we in Nigeria do not regard our independence as complete so long as there remains a parcel of land in Africa, on the African Continent, which is still under foreign domination, nor shall we rest in our struggle so long as racism and racial discrimination as a philosophy of government is practiced in our continent.
Your Vice President restated very clearly your Government's policy in this regard when he was in Lagos a few months ago, and we were very pleased to hear it anew. But may I ask, Mr. President, to let us work more closely and more diligently together to eradicate this evil which the whole international community has declared abominable. It is our hope that your administration and the entire American people, who have purged racism from your own society by law, will collaborate with us in doing the same by our votes in the United Nations in the case of our continent. It is better for South Africa to heed the voice of these nations now and work for peaceful change than to wait 'to be engulfed in a violent upheaval.
In closing, Mr. President, let me entertain the pleasant wish that these happy relations between the friendly peoples of the United States of America and the peoples of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which we celebrate here tonight, will endure and that they will serve to make this world a better habitat for all mankind.
Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, may I, in the fond hope, invite you to raise your glass and drink with me a toast: to the personal well-being of the President and Mrs. Carter, to the happiness of the American people.
PRESIDENT CARTER. Thank you, Mr. President.

The President. Prime Minister Carlsson and Mrs. Carlsson, ladies and gentleman, welcome to the White House. Nancy told me much about the warmth and good will that was so evident in Sweden during her June visit. We both have looked forward to this opportunity to express our appreciation and to return the hospitality so graciously extended to her.
I welcome you, Mr. Prime Minister, as long-overdue friends. Sweden, while quite some distance in miles, has never seemed very far away to me. As a boy in northern Illinois I had neighbors with names like Hansson and Lund. This morning in the course of our discussions, I realized anew what I have long known: that Sweden and America share the same basic values and the same hopes for a more peaceful and prosperous world. We often pursue our similar goals through different means, but our democratic traditions have bred in us both an appreciation for diversity and an understanding that there is often more than one way to achieve a goal.
Today we welcome our guests with special warmth because this is not merely the visit of a Prime Minister on an official trip but also somewhat of a sentimental journey. In 1960, Mr. Prime Minister, early in your married life, you went to Northwestern University in Illinois, where you attended graduate school and Mrs. Carlsson worked in the university library. A hard-working young couple building a future together. I'm happy to note that the still-young Carlssons next month will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. [Applause] You've heard this, and let me add the warm congratulations of both Nancy and myself. I understand you'll be visiting Northwestern again this Saturday, and I wish you a most pleasurable return to this special place.
Mr. Prime Minister, our countries have been friends as long as the United States has been a country. Today we've had the opportunity to reaffirm the bonds of affection between our peoples and to talk of the issues we, as the leaders of two free nations, face in the world. Prime Minister and Mrs. Carlsson, I raise my glass to you and to the Swedish people in friendship, and I ask all of you to join me in this toast and in a hearty skal.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentleman, this beautiful dinner in the White House is the culmination of a day of intense and interesting talks with our American friends. The splendor of this evening and the opulent beauty of the Washington summer highlight the character of the Swedish-American friendship.
In several respects, no comparison between our two countries is possible. We're obviously a different size. We're certainly a different influence. We have different histories, and we sometimes voice different views. But in many other respects our two nations are very similar. What has been called the American way of life has a great attraction for many Swedes, not least for the young. American trends in art, music, and sports seem to reach our shores faster and stay longer than in many other countries.
But some of the influence has also been in the other direction. During the last century, more than a million Swedes came to this country, and most of them came to stay and start a new life here, bringing with them a part of Sweden to this land. You will still remember many of them. One is Carl Sandburg, the son of a Swedish immigrant who became one of America's greatest poets. Another is Jenny Lind, a much-loved Swedish singer who toured this country for several years in the 19th century. The aviator Charles Lindbergh was the grandson of a Swedish farmer. And if we look at the most recent wave of immigration, we find that there are no less than 22 Swedish players in the teams of the National Hockey League. [Laughter]
There is still great interest among Swedes in traveling to the United States. This interest is encouraged, for instance, by an extensive student exchange program and is, above all, supported by the generosity of American colleges and universities in admitting students from overseas. I'm one of the Swedes who once studied in this country. The year which my wife, Inga, and I spent at Northwestern University in Illinois was one of our most memorable. We very much look forward to returning there this weekend to revive old memories.
Mr. President, during our talks today, we agreed that the close and friendly Swedish-American relations are in a dynamic phase, with intensified contacts in many fields. One very good example is, of course, the visit which you, Mrs. Reagan, made to Sweden in June. Permit me to add, Mrs. Reagan, that your knowledge of and your dedication to the grave problems of drug abuse made a profound impression on your Swedish hosts.
Two days ago I had the privilege of personally visiting the U.S.S. Constitution, a very fine ship in the port of Boston. We were there again reminded of the forthcoming bicentennial of the American Constitution to be celebrated in Philadelphia next week. We are proud that Sweden is one of five countries singled out to be honored there for having had diplomatic relations with the United States for more than 200 years. Next year we will see another celebration of the 350th anniversary of the first Swedish settlement in America. We deeply appreciate it that you, Mr. President, on this account, have proclaimed 1988 as the Year of New Sweden.
I spoke initially about the differences and the similarities between our two countries. We are both engaged by and concerned with events beyond our borders. This is natural for the United States as a major partner in several military alliances. But it's also the natural course for Sweden as a neutral country, since we, too, are affected by international developments. In particular, we know that we all run the risk of annihilation in a nuclear exchange.
Let me, therefore, Mr. President, in conclusion, again assure you that Sweden will support every effort by you and your Soviet counterpart to begin a process of reducing nuclear arms. I understand that you are near an historic breakthrough in the endeavor to start dismantling nuclear weapons. There are millions of people around the world who share your sentiments, Mr. President, about the immorality of a nuclear war. The fact that an agreement is near which may make such a war so much less likely is a signal of hope to all mankind.
May I finally ask you all to join me in a toast of the President and Mrs. Reagan, to the American people, and to the friendship between Sweden and the United States.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"April 30, 1987","
Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Nakasone, we are again honored to have you visit our home. One of the joys this high office has afforded Nancy and me has been the opportunity to develop a personal relationship with you. We cherish your visits here and our travels to Japan. We remember sharing many moments, sitting with you in a tranquil setting, sharing personal thoughts and feelings.
We also remember attending an astounding archery exhibition as your guests. Men on horseback, in full traditional armor, with bow and arrow, hit their target with precision at full gallop. Now, I'm keenly aware of how difficult it is to control a horse in such a show. I was doing a picture once called ""Santa Fe Trail."" [Laughter] I was playing General Custer when he was a lieutenant [laughter] and the scene called for me to ride up until the horse's head was practically over the mouth of a cannon, and then I was to shout an order and so forth and carry on from there. But at the same time, the director had ordered them to shoot the cannon. [Laughter] When I got the horse stopped, we were about a quarter of a mile away and had knocked down 16 reflectors that were supposed to be shooting sunlight onto the scene, and we could not get the horse back closer than 200 yards to the cannon. [Laughter] But our pride in horsemanship is only one example of the many cultural similarities between our peoples. [Laughter]
Certainly, in each comparison, there are differences, yet one cannot help but be struck by the likeness of our two peoples. They're achievers; they're goal-oriented builders, tenacious people. One individual who personified these traits was a remarkable citizen of your country who climbed the highest peaks on six continents. He floated down the Amazon River on a balsa raft. And he was the first person to do a solo journey to the North Pole. His name was Naomi Uemura, who said after one amazing feat, ""For me, an end is just the beginning."" Well, never afraid to try, he said, ""I always want to know the limits of human endurance or the limits of my own potential.""
On February 12, 1984, his 43d birthday, he became the only climber to make a solo climb of Mount McKinley's 20,320-foot peak in midwinter, and only days later, Naomi Uemura lost his life. I cannot help but think that the message of this unique individual is something that touches the soul of both our peoples and should guide us in our dealings. Let us not be afraid to take our relationship to its utmost potential. Let us realize that every goal we reach is just a beginning of the next challenge.
Prime Minister Nakasone and I had forthright and productive discussions today. We, in a way, are also explorers, traversing unchartered paths and pushing on to achieve new goals and reaching for new heights. And, unlike Mr. Uemura, we do not travel alone. The American and Japanese people will climb this mountain together and will not only survive but triumph.
And so, I ask you now to all join me in a toast. To Prime Minister and Mrs. Nakasone, and to the people of Japan, all our friends.

state-dinners,George Bush,"March 20, 1991","
President Bush. Mr. President and Mrs. Walesa, 2 years ago Barbara and I had the privilege of dining at your home in Gdansk. And today we are simply delighted to have you and other members of the Polish delegation at the White House.
It's been said that the character of a people is embodied in its leaders. And that is certainly true of tonight's honored guest. Eight years ago you were unable to visit Norway to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. Tonight, America salutes you as an apostle of peace throughout the world.
Some leaders reflect their time. Mr. President, you have defined your time. You have been resolute in defeat and magnanimous in victory. You have fought to preserve liberty for all: for individuals, choice; for societies, pluralism; for nations, self-determination. To a crisis of the spirit, you supplied an answer of the spirit -- an answer forged upon trust in God and man.
Over the centuries Poland suffered through a winter of adversity. But you and your countrymen have delivered Poland into a springtime of thrilling possibility. You've brought us all to the verge of a new and freer world. And you helped a nation and a planet, if you will, summon lightness against the dark.
You've delivered the message of freedom everywhere. Go to Gdansk or Warsaw -- they know that by rediscovering its past, Poland is uplifting the future. Mr. President, under you, sir, Poles have learned anew that the individual, not the state, is the voice of tomorrow. You've used that voice to unlock minds and boundaries, enlarging Poland's horizons and helping build a new Europe, whole and free. For that, I thank you on behalf of every American.
Let me close with a story that shows the spiritual ties that bind our lands. It happened in 1776, when America was at a turning point in its history. A great Polish patriot fought with the Colonies, then returned to Poland with a simple three-word message. Today, 200 years later, you have returned General Kosciusko's message to the country of its birth: liberty, security, property. These words inspired the Joint Declaration of Principles that we signed today.
And so, now may I invite all our guests to raise our glasses to Polish-American friendship; to the health of our dear, admired friend; and to the liberty we can and must achieve for all the children of the world. Mr. President, sto lat. May you live 100 years. God bless you.
President Walesa. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I'm convinced that I shall be at a loss for words to express my gratitude. It is for the second time that I'm present in the White House. It is, to me, a reason for honor, and it is moving.
It is also proof of the friendship that links the American nation with the Polish nation. This friendship was seen by the hundreds of thousands of Poles who, here, found their second motherland. They came from across the ocean because they were looking for freedom. America was freedom to them and remained a symbol of freedom.
Today, we and the country on the Vistula River also have freedom. Nobody, thank God, has to leave Poland. We have achieved new prospects through the reduction of the Polish debt. We are deeply grateful for the role which you, Mr. President, played in this magnificent act. It is a relief for millions of Poles. We shall remember this.
Two years ago, you were a guest in my home in Gdansk. Now, I am your guest in America. I am met here with undescribable sincerity. I hope that we shall meet on many more occasions. At the end, I would like to toast the most popular politician in Poland. [Laughter] Today it was passed on to the mass media -- this politician, President George Bush. [Laughter] I came up third in the poll. [Laughter]
So, to your health and that of your wife. To the health of all present here, all the magnificent American friends, your health.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"November 08, 1979","
THE PRESIDENT. Prime Minister and Mrs. Lynch, Jack and Mairin, we're delighted to welcome you to the White House again, the first time in your role as the head of a great nation. I know that everyone here who is of Irish descent feels particularly at ease, because—as Jack pointed out to the group of enthusiastic welcomers this morning—the architect of the White House was a very famous Irishman, trained in Dublin, from Kilkenny, named James Hoban. And those of you who have visited Ireland know that this White House bears a very strange and not accidental resemblance to the home of the Irish Parliament. So, we're very delighted to have you here in an. Irish home where many Irish Presidents have served.
Jack Lynch is famous in Ireland for many things: first of all, as an athlete who was noted for his prowess on the playing fields. And he's also famous as a political leader, a man of quiet courage, a gentle man, a man who's a moderate leader, who's strong and courageous.
Our country has benefited greatly from many famous Irishmen as well—Daniel Boone, John Wayne, Bing Crosby, John L. Sullivan, and, in a more modern day, George Meany, Tip O'Neill, and many others that I don't have the time to name. Many assembled in this room are proud of their Irish blood. And I think that one of the most famous, George M. Cohan, expressed it very well when he said that he was ""a real live nephew of my Uncle Sam,"" and later in the same song, ""I'm proud of all the Irish blood that's in me."" This could be kind of a theme song of many Americans.
Once, when an American visited Dublin, the former mayor, Mayor Briscoe said, ""On behalf of 30 million Irishmen, I welcome you to Dublin."" And he later said, ""I'm talking about 5 million in Ireland and 25 million in the United States."" [Laughter] Both figures were slight exaggerations, but we do have 20 million Americans here who are Irish or of Irish descent, and on St. Patrick's Day, Mr. Prime Minister, there are at least 200 million— [laughter] —Americans who are Irish.
Americans are particularly proud of Ireland and what you have done. Not many people, not enough people know that Ireland has the fastest growing economy in Europe—a nation which is now a better and better place to live for young and old; a nation playing a growing leadership role in the councils of Europe and indeed the entire world; a nation which has benefited, as have we, with rapidly increasing American investments; a nation who still sends missionaries and priests to the United States, to Georgia, and to many other parts of the world; a nation that is committed to peace enough to be a demonstrator of courage, whose soldiers now serve in a sacrificial way in the Congo, in Cyprus, in Lebanon; a nation that has indeed found its leadership role in Europe and throughout the world.
Those who know history understand that Ireland was the nurturer of the seed of Western civilization throughout the Dark Ages and has meant so much to our country—in the past, in the present, and will in the future—in our heritage, our belief in freedom, our culture, our love of arts. And we are all proud that Ireland has now been recognized in every nation as occupying a legitimate and well-deserved role of leadership in the political, cultural life of Europe and the world.
Ireland is also a nation which has suffered from bloodshed and division. Ireland is not alone in modern day suffering. I talked to my wife not too long ago, at 6 o'clock our time, which was 6 o'clock in the morning in Thailand. She's now, about 7:30, arrived at one of the refugee camps that she'll be visiting' all during this day, our night, and she'll be exploring ways where our great and prosperous and blessed country can help those who suffer from starvation and persecution.
A little earlier this evening I had to cancel my planned, long-planned trip to Canada, because Americans are suffering from international terrorism in being held against their will, and my responsibility is to protect the lives of Americans in foreign countries and here at home.
Our guest, the Prime Minister of the great nation of Ireland, represents the kind of leadership necessary in a world that's still plagued with suffering and with threats, with violence to the laws of man and God, and with terrorism. He's a man of quiet strength. As I said earlier, as on the playing fields, in his leadership role he's a man of gentleness. He has a firm voice of reason, and because of his quiet strength, Ireland and we and the other nations who look to him for leadership benefit greatly.
I would like for all of you to join me in a toast to Prime Minister and Mrs. Jack Lynch, our friends, to the Irish everywhere, and to the indomitable spirit of their lovely land, which is also our lovely land. To the Irish and to our notable guest of this evening.
THE PRIME MINISTER. Mr. President, Miss Lillian—glad to see you here, delighted you have come—Ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen:
When I see the President of the United States using as a script two sides of a small envelope— [laughter] —it ill-behooves me to take out my script here this evening. [Laughter] There are a few points in it that perhaps I would like to refer to it in order to get across to you. And I'd, first of all, like to thank you, Mr. President, for your gracious welcome, for your kind words about my country, about my wife, and about me.
I just want to recall an occasion, oh, some 30 years ago, when a very wellknown American came to Ireland, and he had performed admirably in the Berlin Olympics of 1936, I think it was. His name was Jesse Owens. And he had won the 100, the 220, the relay, and the long jump; he had four Olympic gold medals. And I introduced Jesse Owens as a. great athlete, as a gentleman, and a lot of other things. And when he got up to address the assembly—it was some kind of an athletic seminar—he said, ""Thank you, Mr. Lynch, for saying exactly what I had written down for you."" [Laughter] Your President has said things about me that I mightn't have written for him, but I know they were too profuse, but certainly about my country, he said nothing that I wouldn't have wanted him to say anyway.
But we have had a gracious welcome here. My wife, Mairin, and I have been especially touched by the warmth of that welcome, and I think the spirit of it emphasized the spirit of America through the ages. Just over 400 years ago, the population of the United States, that is, the area occupied by the United States, was less than the population of my country now. And into this territory people have flowed from all over the world, people of Europe, from Africa, and of Asia, and they have made their home here. And you in America have provided them with the hospitality which all the bounty of nature has made possible and, as well, the virtue of good and just government has secured.
In Europe today, we face the problems that the United States faced many, many years ago. Europe is now integrating, as the States once did. And although the times are not the same, the European Community now has a comity of nations, each acutely conscious of its own sovereignty, but each willing to compromise in the interests of the greater good, as the States once did in America and still do today. But we have our problems in the process of this evolution, problems in which you have given an example for the rest of us to overcome.
I think the United States can be truly said as the world's outstanding example of unity in diversity. And the words in your motto, ""E Pluribus Unum,"" describe not just aspiration but attainment. And we outside the States, those of us in Ireland and in other countries in Europe, look on your achievement with pride and genuinely with pride, since so many of our forebears were part of that achievement. But to you Americans belong the real pride, because you must live every day with the burden and with the responsibility which America's power brings in the world today.
As the President has said, Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the European Community, and in that capacity we represent fellow Europeans at numerous international conferences, including the United Nations. We in Europe see ourselves as a community in an interdependent world, as a potent and growing force, building on our relations with both developing and developed countries in a friendly and a cooperative spirit.
In pursuing this policy, the EEC's relationship with the United Nations is particularly significant. You, Mr. President, have said—and we welcome what you'd said in this respect—that you see European strength and unity not as a threat, but as a boon. The plain truth is that Europe and the United States need each other. Interdependence is not just an empty phrase; it describes a fact.
I don't have to go into the problems that we face together in the world of today: the depletion of resources, the abuse of human rights, the increase in armaments and nuclear proliferation, starvation and global confrontation. We both-not just as a small nation, like Ireland is-but we both, in our capacity as a member of the European Community, with the United States, have to face up to these problems.
We have the problems of new technology, and we're moving into worlds where none of us has ever been: the shift in the balance of trade involving the developing countries—and we must look after them as well—and the demographic changes which can alter the whole structure of a society. And all these problems can be dealt only in a coordinated way, and certainly I can see much damage being done in a return to an oldfashioned protectionism or economic nationalism. You, Mr. President, have expressed time and time again the value to the West and the developing world of Multinational Trade Negotiations designed to avoid just such dangers.
We think that in Ireland we have a special role to play in symbolizing the common interests between the United States and Europe, as well as the great potential still to be tapped in an even closer cooperation between the two continents.
Our island is roughly 200 miles wide, 300 miles long. We're close to the European mainland. We're the closest European country to the United States of America. In fact, there are so many parishes on the west coast of Ireland that describe themselves as the nearest parish to the United States— [laughter] —that one outbids the other—I don't know yet which is. But I think in my part of the country, in the southwest of Cork, we can claim that we really are the closest parish to the United States. [Laughter]
Mr. President, your having spoken from the back of an envelope, as I said, I'd better not have any more recourse to my script, except to say that we are glad we have this opportunity of being here, of being your official guests, glad of the opportunity of representing the European Economic Community here in Washington on this occasion.
Back at home we have some progress to report; we have difficulties. We went into these difficulties today with the President, with the Secretary of State, with the Foreign Relations Committee of the House and of the Senate. I believe one is Foreign Relations and the other is Foreign Affairs; I forget which is which.
But I was glad to see my old friend Tip O'Neill there this afternoon, a man who has given a great lead as far as insight and understanding of the Irish situation is concerned. We welcome that. You, Mr. President, in August 1977, similarly showed the same interest and the same concern.
We're doing fairly well in Ireland. We are proceeding economically. Our population is increasing—which is unusual in Europe at the present time—perhaps not as much as we would like, as there's a story about a lady who, having had six children, people were wondering why she didn't have the seventh. Somebody said to her, ""Well, you've produced six beautiful children, terrific assets, a compliment to the nation, and why don't you go ahead?"" She said, ""No, nothing doing as far as I'm concerned. I read the other day that every seventh child born into the world is a Chinese."" [Laughter]
Notwithstanding that admonition, our population is, happily, growing. And more and more of our population are staying at home, with the result that there will be less Hobans, less O'Neills, perhaps even Garters. I think there are about 120 Carters in the Irish telephone directory. There are a few Lynchs. There was a Lynch who in some way contributed to the Declaration of Independence. But there will be less Lynchs coming to the United States in the future. We thank God for that. We thank our association with Europe, and as well, we thank American investment in our country.
Mr. President, I am delighted to be with you. I'm delighted to be your guest. I'm delighted that your mother has come along to join us, because she proved so popular in Ireland that people like me who— [laughter] —we were getting worried about our own particular position, vis-a-vis the electorate. In fact, your son told us today, Miss Lillian, that you want to go back there sometime soon and for a longer period. We hope you do. And the next time you come, will you please bring your son? We'd like to have him as well. [Laughter]
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to join me now in a toast, a toast to the President, Mrs. Carter, and the people of this great nation, the United States of America. As I said on the White House lawn today, ""Bail o Dhia ort fein agus ar do chuid oibre,"" may God's blessing be with you and with your work. To the President of the United States, Mrs. Carter, and the people of the United States.
THE PRESIDENT. I wish I had time to recognize all the great Irish leaders who are here. I'm very delighted that Mr. George Meany is present and Tip O'Neill; Joe Garrahy, Governor; Brendan Byrne, Governor; Leonard Bernstein, right in front of me here; and my mother, who's a real honorary citizen of Ireland. And I've asked my mother, in the absence of my wife, to join us in the receiving line. We look forward to meeting every one of you.
Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"June 15, 1974","
Mr. President, Mrs. Asad, Your Excellencies, and distinguished guests:
Mr. President, on behalf of all your guests tonight and particularly your American guests, I express appreciation for this magnificent dinner and for the entertainment which accompanied it.
I was somewhat prepared for this evening by our Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. He told me of his great respect for your quick intelligence, for your tough negotiating ability, and also for your statesmanship. And you, Mr. President, have told me that there is a Syrian saying to the effect that the guest's respect and admiration for his host is directly measured by the amount of food the guest consumes at the host's dinner.
I can now see why Henry Kissinger gained 7 pounds in his 13 trips to Damascus over the past 30 days. And whenever we wear him out on his other travels throughout the world, we will send him back here to build him up.
And tonight, in addition to complimenting those who prepared this magnificent dinner, all of them and those who served it so beautifully, may I pay respects on behalf of all our guests and your guests tonight to the cultural groups who entertained us so beautifully.
And it is my hope, Mr. President, that with the cultural exchange program between our two countries being reestablished, that a group like this--maybe this one--you will choose to send to the United States so that people in Washington and other cities may be able to see it and hear it, as we did tonight.
Mr. President, I am sure you must know how I feel in my position standing here in what is generally agreed to be the oldest continually inhabited city in the world, Damascus, and to realize that this city in 6,000 years has seen more of history than any other continually inhabited city on the whole globe.
And tonight, as you have indicated, this ancient city with its honorable traditions, its great history, sees another event which will mark a new direction in the relations not only between two nations but, we trust, between and among many nations in this part of the world.
That new direction is symbolized by what you have referred to, that this is the first time a President of the United States has ever visited Damascus, has ever stood on Syrian soil. But it symbolizes far more than that.
You have indicated the fact that a first step has been taken toward the just and equitable peace that we want for this area of the world. And you have indicated very eloquently, very directly, very candidly, as you have always done, your concern about what other steps may be taken or should be taken in order that the peace be just and be equitable. You have indicated your concern about such matters as the Palestinians, which we, of course, understand; your concern about your borders, which we, of course, understand; and other matters that are for future negotiations.
I would like to tell you that I have an instant solution for these very complex problems, but you would know with your vast experience in diplomacy and negotiations, as would our other guests here, that I do not bring any instant solution to these problems.
I do know that for 30 years that resort to war by either side, by whatever chance, has not solved these problems.
And I do know that the United States, for that reason as well as for other reasons involving our interests in justice and equity, now is directly involved in attempting to get solutions for these problems through the channels of peace rather than through resort to war.
The fact that a first step has been taken has been credited with very good reason to the persistence and ability of our Secretary of State and his colleagues. But your own statesmanship, your own recognition of what could be accomplished and should be accomplished as a first step, played an indispensable part in obtaining this first disengagement step in this critical area.
Tomorrow we will explore in greater detail all of the factors involved in the problems that you have touched upon tonight.
I can simply state tonight, however, that we do not consider the first step to be the last step. It is a beginning, and a good beginning. But now we must move forward step by step as each case permits it to be done until we reach our goal of a just and equitable peace.
And while, Mr. President, as I said earlier, it would be very easy to make rather overblown promises about what can be accomplished and when it can be accomplished, I can tell you that the United States is committed irreversibly to participating where we can be of assistance in working out an equitable and just peace settlement.
And it is with that spirit of good will, of understanding, and of determination that we will enter our talks tomorrow with you on what various steps can be taken in the future that can be effective.
Having referred to that specific problem, may I return, in conclusion, to the theme which you touched upon so eloquently in your remarks.
America is fortunate to have many of Syrian background as citizens of our country. They are all good American citizens but proud of their Syrian background, and they have enriched the diversity of our American life.
And tonight, Mr. President, as I met you, Mrs. Asad, your wonderful family, had the opportunity to see some exhibits of your culture, I realize how much both of our countries have missed in being apart for so many years over these past 20 years.
As I sensed at this dinner tonight and as I sensed as we rode through Damascus earlier today, it is natural for Syrians and Americans to be friends. It is not natural for us to be enemies. And I would hope and trust that we would never again allow differences to drive us apart as they have over these past few years.
We will not always agree, just as friends do not always agree. But as friends, we will learn from each other, and we will work together for a goal to which we are both deeply dedicated, the cause of peace not only between and among the nations in this area but for all peoples in the world.
And so, I think we can safely say that after 6,000 years of history, this great city is seeing again something happening, something that will change not only the relations between our two countries but something that can change the world and make it a better world for all of us.
And for that and many other reasons, Mr. President, Mrs. Nixon and I, Dr. Kissinger, and all of your American guests are proud to be here tonight in your company as your guests.

state-dinners,George Bush,"July 11, 1989","
Well, thank you, sir, for those very warm words of welcome. And I'm delighted to have this opportunity to visit Hungary once again, to see firsthand the remarkable changes taking place here.
We live at a great moment in human affairs, an era when change is shaking the existing order. From Beijing to Budapest, from Tiananmen Square to the long delayed day of healing in Heroes Square less than a month ago, we're witnessing the expression of democratic idea whose appeal is universal, whose impact is worldwide. And here in the heart of central Europe, Hungary is at the center of change. Your nation is involved in an unprecedented experiment: a Communist system seeking to evolve towards a more open economy, towards a more open and pluralistic political system.
No one now denies that reform is the path of the future. In nation after nation, decades of experience have proven beyond any doubt the poverty of an idea: the idea that progress is the product of the state. On the contrary, progress is the product of the people. And state control simply cannot provide sustained economic growth, nor can it provide a regime the political legitimacy it needs to govern. Most of all, the state is in constant conflict with human liberty.
In Hungary today, there is a deepening consensus on the direction that reform must take, on a new model for state and society: in economics, the competitive market; in politics, pluralism and human rights.
The key to economic success is letting the market do its work, and that means an end to inefficient government intervention in the marketplace, an end to the dead weight that drags down overall economic growth. It means factories and enterprises of all kinds playing by the rules of the marketplace, according to the laws of supply and demand -- in other words, rules that work for the individual and the common good.
And economic competition has a parallel in the political sphere. Pluralism is nothing more than an open and honest competition between parties, a competition between points of view. Pluralism is what we in the West call the marketplace of ideas. The open elections that Hungary has promised will mark a great advance and allow your great nation to enjoy the benefits of pluralism. The hopeful process of Helsinki points the way to the enhancement of freedom in central Europe, to a new basis for security and cooperation in all of Europe.
All Hungarians should look to the future with confidence in what Hungary can be. This is only the beginning. I see in Hungary's future a country of hundreds of thousands of small enterprises -- sources of innovation, productivity, and prosperity. And I see in Hungary's future new voices speaking out, shaping the course of national affairs. I see a Hungary at peace with itself, a Hungary assuming its rightful place as a vital part of an emerging Europe -- a Europe whole and free.
The road ahead will be difficult. There's no denying that. But I believe in Hungary; I believe in her ability to meet and master the challenge: to make reform succeed. The key is Hungary's most precious resource -- her people. Each individual is an infinity of possibilities, and in the capacity of those individual talents lies the future of your nation. So, now let us raise our glasses: To the future of Hungarian reform; to the friendship, the genuine friendship, between the American and the Hungarian people. And thank you for this warm welcome.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"October 06, 1988","
President Reagan. Mr. President, it's a pleasure to welcome you here this evening. We're honored by your visit to the United States, both as the President of Mali and as the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. During your visit, we've been discussing issues of concern to Mali, the Organization of African Unity, and the United States. And I'm gratified that you share our concerns about regional stability and economic development in Africa. And we've appreciated your efforts to promote peace and development.
I want you to know that we'll continue to work with you and be as supportive as possible in addressing these areas. But Africans and Americans do not just share a concern for various international problems. We share a rich cultural heritage as well. One out of six Americans, Mr. President, trace their ancestry to Africa. And indeed all of us are very proud of that African heritage and are eager to learn more about the African cultures from which they came.
I think this points to another common cultural thread between Mali and the United States. Mali has a proud and ancient history. It had three empires before Europeans first settled in what is now the United States. Malian explorers sailed the high seas and may even have visited America. All Americans, even if they know little else about Africa, have heard of the great and historical city of Timbuktu. It once meant to us a distant place. Your visit has brought both our nations closer. Mali, like the United States, is a country made up of people from different ethnic and religious groups. We admire Mali's respect for diversity that is both in your constitution and in practice. I know you're all amazed at my ability at French. [Laughter]
Americans believe that the ethnic diversity of the United States is one of our country's greatest strengths. And I think this is best summed up in one of your proverbs: One person, one thought; two persons, two thoughts. From the ideas of many different people and the freedom to express those ideas comes the strength of a nation.
Mr. President, I look forward to continuing to share ideas with you. By exchanging ideas and working together with the leaders of a great and ancient continent, I believe we can find solutions with a human face to the problems confronting the world. I salute you as a good friend, a great leader of your people, and as the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. And so, can we raise our glasses, to President Traore and Madame Traore.
President Traore. Mr. President, Members of the Congress and Members of the Senate, members of the administration, your excellencies, Ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen: May I on this occasion renew my very sincere thanks to you, as well as the thanks of my delegation for the warm welcome and very cordial hospitality that we have been enjoying ever since we arrived in the United States, this great and beautiful land of freedom.
Mr. President, Mali and the United States have excellent relations in the areas of political, economic, social, and cultural relations. The many agreements for cooperation between our two countries cover all fields of activity, and they fall very clearly within our strategy for development. We seek, first of all, self-sufficiency in food production, control of our water resources, breaking away from the landlocked situation of our country—both domestic and foreign—and training our human resources.
I'm happy to salute here the very valuable assistance that your government has been extending to us in securing these objectives. In order to have a better performance for our economy, we have undertaken, together with international financial institutions and friendly nations, a very profound and exhaustive reform which touches upon all sectors of development—public finances, state-owned enterprises, developments of the rural area, and private sector. Basically, we are seeking to mobilize all energies and all the creative potential of the people-Mali. The people of Mali, just like the people of the United States, has a very highly developed sense of enterprise.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, concerning Africa, our principal concerns remain the total liberation of the continent and the social and economic development. Recent trends in southern Africa allow us to think that it may soon become a reality that Resolution 435 may soon become implemented helping Namibia accede to independence. The international community must spare no effort and gather all its strength in order to force the governments of South Africa to comply with the requirements of the implementation of this pertinent resolution. Side by side with the fighters of South Africa, the Organization of African Unity will continue to struggle for the taking down of the intolerable system of apartheid. We seek to establish in South Africa a more humane, more just society which has been rid of all forms of segregation.
In this connection, Africa enjoys very much the ever-growing support of the great American people. Your Constitution, your democratic traditions have inspired many people throughout the world.
In the economic area, Mr. President, it is urgent to find a just and lasting solution to the problem of the African debt. Thus, the Organization of African Unity has been calling for the convening of an international conference on that issue. In solving the problem of the African debt, we will have to factor in the issue of raw materials and commodity prices as Africa is a producer because it is only through a just remuneration of their production that the African nations will secure the steady resources necessary to their development and to payment of the debts.
May I, in closing, ladies and gentlemen, ask you to raise your glass with me to the health of President Ronald Reagan, to the health of Mrs. Reagan, the strengthening of the friendship between our two nations, and closer bonds of cooperation and solidarity among all people of the world. I thank you.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"January 25, 2015","
Good evening, President Mukherjee, Prime Minister Modi, distinguished guests. On behalf of Michelle and myself, I want to extend our deepest thanks for the extraordinary hospitality that you've shown us here today. We feel your friendship, your dosti. And I am deeply honored to be the first American President to join you in celebrating India's Republic Day.
I also want to thank you for not making me dance again. [Laughter] The last time we were here, we joined some children in Mumbai for Diwali, and we danced. It was pretty clear what the Indian press thought. One headline said, ""President Obama Visits India."" The other said, ""Michelle Obama Rocks India."" [Laughter] It is true, Michelle is a better dancer than me.
Let me also thank my partner and friend, Prime Minister Modi. I've often said that my life story could only happen in America. But of course, Mr. Prime Minister, your story could only happen in India. Here this evening, we think back to all those years ago, to your father selling tea in the train station and your mother working at other families' homes to support her own. And tonight their son welcomes us as the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy.
Now, we all know about the Prime Minister's legendary work ethic. He was explaining to me today how he only needed 3 hours' sleep, which made me feel bad. I thought, I was doing okay with 5. [Laughter] What I didn't know until now is that he once survived an attack by a crocodile. So he's tough. And he also has style. One of our newspapers back home wrote: ""Move aside, Michelle Obama. The world has a new fashion icon."" [Laughter] Tonight I was thinking about wearing a Modi kurta myself. And while I do not want to use a dinner like this to make United States policy, let me just say that given the Prime Minister's advocacy at the United Nations, Michelle and I are looking forward to the first International Yoga Day.
Our visit reflects the deepest connections and long friendship between our peoples. One of America's greatest poets was Walt Whitman, and more than a century ago he wrote a poem, ""Passage to India,"" in which he celebrated the technological ingenuity and human spirit that joins our nations. He wrote,""Seest thou not God's purpose from the first? The earth to be spann'd, connected by network, the people to become brothers and sisters."" Here, in our time, these words have come to pass.
India and America have spanned the Earth, connected and networked by technology and by family, including millions of Indian Americans, among them our Nation's first Indian American Ambassador to India, Rich Verma. And in the shared work of our world, our purpose—lifting up our fellow citizens, advancing human dignity—we, as the poet predicted, have become brothers and sisters.
Tomorrow we will celebrate Republic Day. We will honor the generations of Indians who built this nation through toil and tears and iron will. And at the end of the day, I'm told the band will play that hymn that was dear to the heart of Mahatma Gandhi:
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee, Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
And so I propose a toast, if I can get a glass—ah, here we go. To the great partnership between our nations and the friendship—the dosti—between our peoples. Here in the eventide, Indians and Americans, let us know, in the darkness or day, in good times or bad, whenever one of us looks to the other, we will surely say, abide with me.
Cheers!
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]

state-dinners,George Bush,"July 02, 1991","
President Bush. Mr. President, I felt that we achieved today a true meeting of the minds on many issues. And I understand in addition to meeting with me and the Cabinet, your busy schedule took you to separate meetings with the Secretaries of State and Defense, individually—I guess you'll see Dick Cheney tomorrow. But best of all, we finally had time, after all the planning and talking, to get you out on the White House tennis court. [Laughter] And I know there's an awful lot of interest in this, so I'm proud to report that the President and I won both matches. [Laughter]
Mr. President, many ties bind our nations: Our devotion to democratic ideals; the fact that Korea is now our seventh-largest trading partner; the many Americans of Korean ancestry, more than three-quarters of a million strong, who are making their mark in this country as entrepreneurs and athletes and in the arts and in our universities, indeed, in every walk of life. They make a marvelous contribution to America.
And today, Mr. President, our two countries, mine and yours, are partners in a common challenge. As free nations it falls to us to maintain peace, liberty, and prosperity for our peoples and for men and women everywhere.
And so, once again we welcome you, sir. And tonight I'd like to offer this toast to the Republic of Korea, staunch ally in war, steadfast partner in peace, and a valued member of the community of free nations. So, let us raise our glasses to President and Mrs. Roh, to the proud Republic of Korea, and to the lasting friendship between the people of Korea and the United States of America.
President Roh. Mr. President, this afternoon I received the most precious gift of my life, which I shall treasure. I'm of course referring to the very rare original edition of the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates which you have so kindly secured for me. I'm all the more moved to discover the Lincoln portrait here at the State Dining Room.
Referring to common man, President Lincoln said that common men are the best kind, and that is why God created so many common men. To open a great era of common people was a slogan of my Presidential campaign, and it is still the motto of my government. When I decided the common people as my campaign theme, I of course did not have the foggiest idea that President Lincoln had already expounded on the subject. [Laughter] It was much later that I was told of this historical antecedent. You see, I now realize that I may have violated, however unwittingly, President Lincoln's intellectual property rights. [Laughter] Please believe me, it was not a case of willful violation on my part. [Laughter]
Your Excellency, President and Mrs. Bush; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen: I would like to extend my deep appreciation to you, Mr. President, for the kind invitation to visit your great country and for the warm welcome and generous hospitality accorded me and my delegation.
Through our meetings this morning, Mr. President, I can reaffirm that we are indeed living in a great era of change. In the span of only 2 to 3 years, the world has undergone revolutionary changes. In your Inaugural Address, Mr. President, you said, ""a new breeze is blowing, and the world refreshed by freedom seems reborn."" The world is indeed being reborn.
The Fourth of July this year will truly be a unique day in American history. For the first time in 215 years, the American people will he able to celebrate a worldwide realization of the founding ideals of the Declaration of Independence: namely that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are inalienable rights bestowed upon all man. On this occasion the entire Korean people who have been pursuing these common ideals join me in extending heartfelt congratulations to the American people.
The Gulf war victory has established that the international community will no longer tolerate wanton aggression and that the rule of law shall prevail in the international community. We are at an historical juncture toward establishing a new world order of freedom, justice, and peace. I salute you, Mr. President, for your courageous decisions and firm leadership and to the American people for their unflagging support for the cause of freedom.
Mr. President, it will be perhaps impossible today to separate American and Korean values and ideas in various aspects of Korean life, including the political, economic, educational, scientific, and cultural. In the course of developing such a strong bond between our two countries across the Pacific, many of your people rendered invaluable services and noble sacrifices. The Korean people shall never forget the enormous contributions made on our behalf
Even at this very moment, more than 40,000 American service men and women are on the other side of the Pacific on a vigil for peace on the Korean peninsula. You deserve to be proud that the Republic of Korea, which received so much encouragement and support from the United States, is now moving ahead toward a land of freedom and prosperity.
Today, Korea has entered an era of liberal democracy. Despite transitional difficulties, democracy in Korea is on course and is moving inexorably forward. Commensurate with its political, economic development, Korea is determined to assume appropriate roles and responsibilities in the international community. I believe that Korea and the United States should closely cooperate and encourage changes that will remove tension, instability, and the barrier which divides the Korea peninsula.
Mr. President, as valued partners, Korea and the United States together shall usher in a free, new, peaceful, and prosperous Pacific era in the 21st century. Our meeting today heralds this commitment to the Pacific and to the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast to the health of President and Mrs. Bush, to the ever-enduring prosperity of the United States of America, and to the lasting friendship between Korea and the United States. Thank you.

state-dinners,George Bush,"June 06, 1989","
The President. Prime Minister Bhutto, Mr. Zardari, it's a great pleasure and an honor for Barbara and me to welcome you to the United States and to the White House. I also want to welcome a third honored guest not here tonight, the master, Bilawal Zardari. [Laughter] He's 9 months old. He had to go to bed early, so he couldn't come to the White House. And we're all heartbroken, but I hope he's having a good time in the United States.
Madam Prime Minister, I've had many years of dealings with the Pakistani people, and always I've marveled at that blend of warmth and kindness best embodied in your phrase, Zindabad -- ""Long live the friendship."" And this evening it is my great pleasure to return that friendship and to say what a privilege it is to salute a woman whose reputation for eloquence and intelligence and courage is all here -- we'll see in a moment -- is eminently well-deserved. And in that context, I should note how one observer said that it was an asset to today's talks that the leaders of both our countries are fluent in the same tongue. [Laughter] That was very nice. Fluency in English is something that I'm often not accused of. [Laughter]
But we've just concluded a round of very frank discussions -- meaningful. And I don't mean it in the diplomatic sense, the U.N. sense, that we used to talk about, but meaningful discussions on a matter of traditional importance. And I think it's a fair characterization to say that the Prime Minister has flatly refused my latest offer: She's not going double or nothing on this year's Harvard-Yale game. [Laughter]
What we did, though, agree to was the steadfast conviction that the cooperation between our countries will grow stronger by the year and to address regional and international issues in the spirit of our shared commitment to liberty, individuality, and democratic ideals. And as you know, I have just returned from Europe, where those ideals strengthen the already close ties between America and her European allies. And that same commitment to democracy joins Pakistan and America as we move towards a more stable and prosperous Asia.
We also talked at length about the plague of drug abuse which afflicts both America and Pakistan. And neither country can afford to allow the scourge of drugs to continue. And throughout our talks we reaffirmed the values which bind us, bind the United States and Pakistan -- values of faith and family and the dignity of work. And we pledge to continue our work together to bring peace and freedom to Afghanistan, stability to all of south Asia.
Madam Prime Minister, our goals are great goals, worthy goals. And together our countries have already done much. And in particular, let me simply salute your role in Pakistan's return to democracy. It was the great Pakistani poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal who once observed, simply, ""Love is freedom and honor."" And, Madam Prime Minister, your entire life shows the meaning of those words. And in that spirit, I ask all of us here tonight, all our guests, to rise and raise their glasses to Pakistan-American friendship; to a safer world for your son and for all children; and to your health and what you symbolize, both for Pakistan and for the rest of the world. God bless you, and good luck.
The Prime Minister. Thank you. I thank you, Mr. President, for the warm and gracious words that you have spoken about Pakistan and about me, personally. We hold you in high esteem because of your exceptional experience in world affairs, the moderation of your approach to the problems facing mankind, and the wisdom and moral quality of your statesmanship.
It is an honor for me to be in this world capital of freedom, in this historic room as the elected leader of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Yet standing here before you, I cannot help but remember the darker days, the days of dictatorship. I feel gratified that our faith, our determination, and our commitment to the universal principles of human dignity and freedom sustained us to this glorious evening, to this glorious day.
Mr. President, I stand with the leader of the world's greatest democracy. I look forward to a new partnership between your country and mine, with democracy giving a fresh dimension to our relationship. Pakistan and the United States have been friends of longstanding. With the triumph of democracy, the relationship is now at the threshold of a new vitality.
This springs from the reservoir of good will that has been nourished by our sustained joint endeavor in support of a worthy cause in Afghanistan: the cause of freedom. We look forward to the day when real peace and stability will return to Afghanistan, when power is transferred to a genuinely representative government. This will allow millions of refugees who have sought sanctuary in Pakistan to return to their homes in honor and dignity.
We now need to look at broader horizons. The people of Pakistan seek peace and stability in their region and a world free of tensions. We would like to see mankind progress and prosper. Pakistan would like to strengthen its friendship with the United States, which shares these objectives.
We have come here with new priorities, Mr. President, new priorities to take our nation and our people into the 21st century. We have come to enrich our friendship and strengthen the partnership between our two nations. Mr. President, I wonder whether you know -- I didn't until very recently -- that we have something in common. We are born, apparently, under the same star. And when I was in Pakistan and the government had just been formed, we weren't allowed much of a political honeymoon by the press. I believe you weren't allowed much of a political honeymoon, either. But I'm glad to know that your trip to Europe in connection with NATO was a big success, because if you've had a successful trip, I must have one, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, I studied at Harvard, and believe me, I didn't know until tonight that Yale ever produced charming men. I'm glad I met the only one. [Laughter]
May I now request you to join me in a toast to the health of the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush, to the strength and prosperity of America and friendship between our people.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"April 19, 1982","
The President. Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, distinguished guests:
This evening we welcome you to the White House realizing that this is a special occasion even for this house, steeped in tradition as it is.
The history of our two countries will undoubtedly record that on this date, the 200th anniversary of our diplomatic relations, the Queen of the Netherlands was our guest at a state dinner in the White House. We thank the Dutch people for sharing you with us. You're the third successive Queen of the Netherlands to grace our Nation's Capital. We look forward to many such visits from you and from your heirs, because if any friendship is lasting and true, it is the one between our two peoples.
The Dutch played a significant role in developing America and shaping our national character. When thinking of this, images come to mind of Henry Hudson, in 1609, sailing up the river that now bears his name, of pilgrims embarking at Delfshaven bound for America after living 12 years in Holland, of the Dutch West India Company buying Manhattan Island and laying the foundation for a magnificent city of commerce, and of sturdy Dutch pioneers breaking ground for new farms in our Midwest.
I thought that I would surprise Her Majesty by telling her that each year there's a tulip festival in Holland, Michigan. She's already booked to go there. [Laughter]
Your Majesty, three American Presidents were of Dutch ancestry. And I'll bet that doesn't surprise you, either. Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt. Their contributions are well known. But countless lesser-known men and women of Dutch ancestry composed the building stones of America. If we were successful in creating a free and prosperous society of which we're rightfully proud, we must be thankful for the part played by our kindred spirits from the Netherlands, people who believed in hard work and who valued freedom. That's the spirit that built America, a spirit that citizens of Dutch ancestry helped instill in the American character.
Rembrandt, one of your great artists, showed the world new uses of light to add depth and meaning to painting. Similarly the Dutch, with uncompromising devotion to liberty, have been a light and inspiration to Americans, even in the depth of their darkest hours.
In the early 1780's, your nation fought a war which was at least partially caused by the affinity between the Netherlands and the American colonists then fighting for independence.
Our friendship, cemented in time and blood, is not taken lightly here. On this 200th anniversary of our fraternity, let us again pledge that we will meet the future together—two nations dedicated to peace, faithful to the cause of human liberty, and confident that right will prevail.
And now, may I ask all of you to join me in a toast to our good friends, the people of the Netherlands, to Her Majesty the Queen, and to His Royal Highness.
The Queen. Mr. President, my husband and I would like to thank you most sincerely for your warm words of welcome. We greatly appreciated the cordial reception given to us by your country, which has highlighted the special nature of the ties of friendship uniting our two nations.
There are few countries whose relations down the centuries have been so genuinely cordial and mutually beneficial as those between your great country, Mr. President, and my own.
It is surprising how many similarities one encounters in the stories of the birth of our two nations. The theory that a people could liberate themselves from their sovereign if he abused his powers was clearly formulated when the Dutch rose in revolt against their king, the King of Spain, in the 16th century. This was the conviction which was echoed in your historic Declaration of Independence two centuries later.
In 1780 we allied ourselves with you in your fight for freedom, alongside France and Spain. We were the second country to officially recognize the United States of America—not entirely without self-interest, I'm afraid—Dutch bankers provided you with the financial aid so desperately needed— [laughter] —in the period of rehabilitation following the War of Independence.
During the 19th century, millions of people from a great many countries, including the Netherlands, felt oppressed in the Old World and set their hopes on the New. It was their hard work and resourcefulness, coupled with the efforts of the descendants of the early colonists, that soon made the United States one of the strongest powers of the world.
Your intervention in the First World War brought peace to Europe. When that terrible struggle was over, it was your President, Woodrow Wilson, who inspired countless Dutchmen with his ideals.
Even more vital was your intervention in the Second World War for both Europe and Asia. Although I was only a child growing up in Canada, I have vivid memories of the warm affection felt by my mother, Princess Juliana, and my grandmother, Queen Wilhelmina, for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. One of the last letters that President Roosevelt wrote early in 1945, 2 days before his death, was to my grandmother, assuring her that measures to help the Netherlands, then suffering from famine and oppression, were very much in his mind. ""You can be very certain,"" he wrote, ""that I shall never forget the country of my origin.""
The memory of that great statesman with his sense of social justice is cherished and honored by innumerable Dutch people. Nor do they forget what they owe to his courageous successor, President Truman, and to President Eisenhower.
It was Eisenhower who, after leading the Allied Forces to victory, became the first Supreme Commander of that great alliance founded a generation ago, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This Alliance, relying principally on the strength of your country, Mr. President, has ensured the security of Europe and thus of the Netherlands.
It was also your country that helped us restore our shattered economy. I have in mind, of course, the Marshall plan, that brilliant example of American statesmanship-statesmanship, above all, because the plan did not seek to impose a pattern of its own but respected the values cherished in Europe, and because it was based on the understanding that helping others to help themselves is in the long run the most effective form of aid, thereby serving best the purposes of both donor and recipient.
We in the Netherlands undoubtedly owe a great deal to the United States. The spirit of enterprise, of daring, of constant innovation is a feature of American life that has always been an inspiration to others.
The winds of change, for example, that swept across Europe in the late sixties also originated in your country. Dutch society has been profoundly affected by artistic influences from America. Constantly improving means of communication have contributed to the advancement of science, trade, and culture on both sides of the Atlantic. All this has brought us closer together than ever before.
In sketching the associations between the United States and the Netherlands over more than 200 years, I intended not only to look back, Mr. President, but also to look forward.
It is the events of the past that have brought us to this point. We face an uncertain future together. Let us set our sights on the ideal of a just and humane society for all mankind. We cannot achieve this without standing up for freedom and respect for human rights. These ideals should constitute the theme underlying our mutual cooperation.
I need hardly add, however, that it is only natural, in view of our long and eventful histories, that our two nations should play the theme in different variations. While recognizing that the stress should be on unity, especially in times of adversity, I regard pluraformity, also within our North Atlantic partnership, as natural and meaningful.
The partnership would not benefit from uncritical, mutual admiration. Assuming that the dialog between the countries is inspired by honest motives and based on mutual trust, we must continue to listen to one another.
The Netherlands will endeavor to make a contribution by being open-minded and undogmatic. Tolerance has always been a feature of our national character. May I, therefore, express the hope that tolerance, openness, and patience will continue to mark our international partnership.
Whatever our differences, there is infinitely more that binds our peoples together. We have become partners of our own free will. Above all, let us not underestimate the strength that can emanate from a union that succeeds in safeguarding both external and internal freedom.
In view of this, I'm confident that relations between your country, Mr. President, and my own will be even closer in the future than they have been in the last 200 years.
May I ask you all to raise your glasses and drink to the health and happiness of the President of the United States of America and Mrs. Reagan, to the good fortune and prosperity of the American people, and to our good relations and centuries-long friendship.

state-dinners,George Bush,"June 18, 1991","
President Bush. Mr. President and Mrs. Collor and distinguished guests, friends of Brazil, it's a distinct privilege for Barbara and me to salute this extraordinary President, Fernando Collor de Mello. I'm glad that Indiana Jones and his wife could join us tonight. [Laughter]
I hear that, yesterday, en route from Brasilia to Washington, the President himself piloted the plane and even helped land it. I'm glad he didn't pull a barrel roll over the South Lawn. [Laughter] But all our Brazilian guests are here tonight, so I guess the passengers weren't too much in danger. Captain Collor got them here a half-hour early, and nobody lost their luggage -- [laughter] -- so things are going very well to start off our visit.
Our two countries were built on the aspirations of pioneers, immigrants, merchants, and workers, hardy people, filled with the spirit of enterprise and independence, enthusiasm and ingenuity. And they came to the Americas determined to achieve lives of freedom and opportunity. And this is our heritage, and we will continue to fulfill it.
The legacy we leave to our future generations must be an alliance of democratic institutions, free markets, and environmental stewardship. President Collor, I salute you, sir, for your efforts to invigorate your political system, your firm commitment to free people and free markets, your determination to raise environmental awareness both at home and abroad.
Our guests deserve to know about your trek to Brazil's scientific outpost in Antarctica. You moved around at such a pace that you almost lost one of your cabinet officers in a snowbank -- something like speed golf, only this was in Antarctica. [Laughter]
Your service to your nation expresses your faith that Brazil will move forward and that our nations will continue to be loyal friends and allies as we enter the 21st century.
In 1876, as the United States celebrated its Centennial, a certain foreign visitor was making his own headlines. Clad in a black suit and silk cap, your Emperor, Dom Pedro II, sailed into New York's East River as thousands of spectators thronged the docks, cheering and saluting. And then he did this: he traveled our country on our new railroad, over 9,000 miles from Maryland to Wyoming to California to Louisiana, causing one newspaper editor to remark that: ""When he goes home, he will know more about the U.S. than two-thirds of the Congress."" [Laughter] An exact quote.
Finally, on July 4th, in Philadelphia, Dom Pedro joined President Grant in opening our centennial exhibit. A hymn was written especially for our 100th birthday by the celebrated Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Gomes. A tribute to your Emperor noted that, ""no distinguished stranger ever came among us who, at the end of 3 months, seemed so little of a stranger and so much of a friend to the whole American people as Dom Pedro II of Brazil.""
Today, Mr. President, you sir, carry on this friendship. Americans are proud to call you our friend. And on their behalf, let me propose this toast to the lasting friendship between the people of the United States and the people of Brazil, to the shared ideals that unite our nations and to a future of freedom, democracy, and prosperity all across the Americas. Once again, welcome, sir.
President Collor. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Rosane and myself, I want to thank you for your kind words and your hospitality tonight and throughout our stay in Washington.
I remember our first meeting in January of last year when I visited as President-elect. Even though it was not on the schedule, you invited us to dine here in a friendly, informal atmosphere. I am pleased that this year's visit has confirmed that same cordiality shown us the night Rosane and I had the real surprise dinner at the White House. I also met the best-selling author that night. [Laughter] Her name is Millie. [Laughter]
Mr. President, whoever visits the United States encounters the fundamental values of Western civilization. Here are joined for the first time in history freedom and well-being. The determination with which I fight for the democratic development of my country is strengthened by the trips I make to the United States.
Brazil is one of the largest countries in the world in terms of the size of its area, population, and economy. We are a democratic, industrialized, and dynamic nation on the path of modernity and determined to overcome the problems of social inequalities. We want these facts recognized, not to increase our status but to increase our participation in world decisions and in contributions to mankind.
Brazil has restored democracy and strengthened its choice of a free market economy. These are the principles that form the foundation for my government's work towards modernizing our country and renewing our international relations.
Respect for human rights, preservation of nature, freedom to trade and to invest, the unvarying pursuit of peace -- these for us are not mere rhetorical expressions. They are the means we have chosen to rescue the millions of Brazilians who still live in poverty.
We are convinced that we have made the correct decision, but we are cognizant of the sacrifices involved. We do not want to share these sacrifices. History shows that the progress of any society is determined by its own efforts. Our desire to change and our willingness to come to grips with the costs of that change must be recognized.
The international community must respond to these national efforts with immediate and effective compensation. The system of nations undergoes rapid transformations, and significant advancements in political strategy must inspire similar daring and creativity in cooperation towards social and economic development.
In an interdependent world, peace will only be consolidated if there is a joint, balanced, and corresponsible effort toward the task of establishing a fair order between men and nations. This is the true destiny of democracies.
Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, ladies and gentlemen, Brazil and the United States are very close to each other. Geographically, our continents are joined. Historically, we belong to the same generation of independent nations. Philosophically, the highest value in both our cultures is placed on individual and group progress and on political and economic freedom. We have a long history of friendship and cooperation in common. But we must do more, much more, and we will do it.
Insofar as the world organizes itself into great continental blocs of economic power, it is clearly our responsibility to build a strong, united region. The partnership which we shall create and extend together with the other nations of Latin America will be fundamental for the future of this hemisphere. The opportunity, President Bush, is before us, within our grasp. Brazil and the United States have never traveled opposite paths. This is no longer enough. Let us now forge better paths together.
I sincerely hope that our reencounter inaugurates a new partnership between the people of our two nations. May God guide us, President Bush. Thank you.
And I would like to propose a toast for the health, the prosperity of the United States of America and its great President, Mr. Bush, and Mrs. Bush.

state-dinners,Lyndon B. Johnson,"October 28, 1966","
Our two peoples live in opposite sides of the world. We have different histories. We have different customs. Yet what we share in common far surpasses our differences.
The very name of your great nation means, in my own language, ""land of the free."" Those words are familiar to every American, for they are part of our national anthem.
That anthem celebrates our homeland as ""the land of the free, and the home of the brave.""
The people of Thailand also understand that those who wish to be free must first be brave.
Your Majesty's ancestors made a long pilgrimage to a new land, rather than accept subjugation. That is what my ancestors also did. Yours were centuries ahead of us. But when our time came, we, too, chose the path of freedom.
The search for freedom led my own ancestors from their homeland in Europe, as it led yours from their ancestral home in China. The Thais were more successful. Since your first migration, nearly one thousand years ago, the people of Thailand have never been a colony of any foreign power. But we Americans are still less than 200 years away from colonial status.
Considering our history, I think it is understandable why my countrymen are puzzled when someone calls us a ""colonialist"" power.
Considering your own history, I think it is understandable why the people of Thailand should be puzzled by those who suggest that you are being ""used"" or ""dominated"" by Americans or, for that matter, anyone else.
The truth is that Thailand and the United States are going down the same road together. We did not start our journey together. But we met on the road which leads, ultimately, to peace and independence for all nations. We of America are very proud to march beside you--beside you who began that journey long before we did.
Tonight we stand as allies in a common cause. At this very moment, Thai forces are assisting the South Vietnamese in their struggle against armed aggression, alongside the forces of the United States of America.
At the same time, you are making available facilities in Thailand of great importance to the collective effort to defend against Communist aggression in Southeast Asia. Your contribution is of major proportions. We know the risks you and we both run to meet the common dangers. But we know also that we act from a joint conviction of common interest.
Let me assure you in this regard that Thailand can count on the United States to meet its obligations under the SEATO treaty. The commitment of the United States under the SEATO treaty is not of a particular political party or a particular administration in my country but is a commitment of the American people as a nation.
And I repeat to you: America keeps its commitments.
I have spoken tonight of defense. But our common cause is a peaceful one. It is the right of every people to determine its own destiny.
The road toward that goal has been long. There are rivers still to cross; there are mountains still to climb. Yet I believe that the hardest part of the journey is past.
I believe that in the lifetime of men now living, the human race will emerge into the sunlit uplands of peace and freedom.
While I am not a prophet, I would like to venture this prediction tonight:
When that time comes, the people of many nations will bless the names of those who stood fast in the cause of freedom during the days of its greatest need and during its hour of darkness.
And among the first of those names will be Thailand--land of the free--and His Majesty the King of Thailand.
Ladies and gentlemen, the King!

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"September 15, 1983","
President Reagan. Mr. President, this morning I mentioned the gratitude that all Americans feel for the part that Portuguese immigrants and their descendants have played in building our nation. And tonight, I must tell you that I owe a personal debt of gratitude to Portugal for another reason: It was in 1542 that a Portuguese explorer, Juan Cabrillo, discovered California, the State that is closest to my heart. [Laughter]
But, Mr. President, this morning we had a chance to explore issues that concern us both. Our discussion about relations between our two countries, our common support for the NATO alliance, and our close consultations on southern Africa demonstrate how much our nations share a firm commitment to freedom and peace.
Americans esteem those who rise from humble beginnings to positions of national service. You and Mrs. Eanes have probably seen the Lincoln Memorial, the monument to a President who began life in a simple log cabin. In many ways your own life parallels that of Lincoln, for you, too, began life in modest surroundings, then rose in the service of democracy to your nation's highest office.
And, Mr. President, we honor you for that achievement. You once stated your determination that the Portuguese people will have their democracy. Today, the Portuguese people do indeed have their democracy and Portugal, fully committed to political and economic freedom, has taken its rightful place among the democracies of the West. As a full and active participant in the NATO alliance, Portugal has proven its willingness to help defend the Western community of nations and the values for which that community stands.
Portugal has thus earned a reputation as a staunch and reliable ally. The security relationship between our two countries has for many years been one of full cooperation and complete mutual respect. Our negotiations for a formal renewal of the security relationship are going well, and I have every confidence that the new agreement will strengthen the security of the West and enhance Portugal's already vital role in the Atlantic alliance.
We in the United States understand the benefit of alliances between allies, and we intend to help Portugal meet its military and economic needs. This is a simple matter of amizade, of friendship. I didn't place the emphasis on the right syllable, but that's as close as I could get. [Laughter]
So, in the spirit of that long and warm friendship between our two nations, Mr. President, I propose a toast to you and to the Republic of Portugal.
President Eanes. President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, distinguished guests:
Gatherings like this among friends and allies always constitute pleasant social occasions to get to know and to understand each other better. They are also political occasions for affirming our common democratic commitment. And this is, in fact, the strongest reason for our easy and natural mutual understanding.
In the past, when Portugal lived under a dictatorial regime, it might have been considered an uncomfortable ally. Kept for decades apart from democratic life, the Portuguese are well aware of the difference that exists between imposed obligations and freely chosen positions.
Today, we can affirm our presence in the Atlantic alliance and assume within it all the necessary positions with the certainty that these positions are supported by the Portuguese people. For that reason, within the framework of the express will of the Portuguese people, we are a responsible ally of the United States with natural and justified expectations.
The deep historical bonds and existing common interests are now strengthened by the common identity of our pluralist democratic political systems. Peoples understand each other more easily and support each other with greater determination when their political institutions have similar modes of action and similar legitimacy.
In our opinion, the world of today clearly confirms that foreign policy involves societies as a whole. For this reason, the harmony of decisions and the continuity of political action have shown themselves to be of such importance in achieving truly consequential objectives in conditions of security, social support, and the furtherance of democracy.
It is only natural for a Portuguese to cite his recent experience of the establishment of a democratic regime in order to underline the importance of internal social conditions for the security and the permanence of external alliances. And it is for this reason that I should like to stress the concern with which I follow the evolution of economic indicators, which point to the need for a joint and determined effort to reorganize this vital sector of contemporary society.
And this is essential for all those who believe in the superiority of the democratic system. In our view, it is also a necessary condition in order to ensure the security not only of each of the democracies but also of the Atlantic alliance itself, and for achieving useful cooperation with various regions of the world.
As a result of the talks that we have been holding, Mr. President, I am further strengthened in my conviction that your statesmanship, sir, is an essential contribution to our mutual commitment to peace and to the strengthening of democratic societies, for these are the necessary conditions for the continuity of political action and for harmony in the decision-making process which will lead to a new era of progress and prosperity.
Mr. President, you have the courage to show firmness in the defense of democratic values and determination in guaranteeing their security, and these are qualities which deserve our sincere admiration.
In this context, it is right that our close friendship should be seen together with our position as a responsible ally which has definite expectations. I am sure that by truly expressing our respective interests, based on democratic legitimacy, we are certain to be able to find ways in which our means and our wills can complement each other in such a way that we will lead to mutual commitments and to joint action.
This is the challenge of our day, when the uncertainties of changing times call for the greatest firmness in the affirmation and defense of democratic values.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I invite you in this spirit of responsibility and friendship to join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Reagan, to whom I wish the greatest happiness and through whom I address to all Americans our best wishes for happiness and prosperity.

Mr. President, Mrs. Kufuor, and all the distinguished guests here: Thank you for your warm welcome. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank the good people of Ghana for the wonderful welcome Laura and I received. I don't think I have been to a country where the people have been more friendly, more open. We appreciate so very much your hospitality, and I really appreciate the George Bush Motorway. [Laughter] The next time I come and ride on the George Bush Motorway, I promise that we will not shut the highway down. [Laughter]
President Kufuor is a close friend. He has earned my respect, and he's earned the respect of leaders all across the world. He is an accomplished man with a good mind and a good heart.
We first met in 2001; we were new Presidents. And here we are, nearly 7 years later, and we're fixing to leave office. [Laughter] But we both vow: We will finish strong with our heads held high.
In the remaining months, we will work to strengthen the partnership between our two nations. The ties that bind the United States and Ghana are as long as they are deep. Last year, Ghana commemorated the 50th anniversary of its independence. And when you claimed your liberty in 1957, the United States of America was by your side. Richard Nixon and Martin Luther King, Jr., were among the notable Americans who were here when the Union Jack was replaced by the red, yellow, and green of the Republic of Ghana. Four years later, 51 idealistic young Americans arrived in your beautiful country as Ghana became the first nation to host volunteers from the Peace Corps.
This long tradition of friendship and cooperation continues today. Today, Ghana and the United States are working to strengthen democracy and good government. Together, we're harnessing the power of global trade to alleviate poverty. And, Mr. President, rest assured, I will work to complete the Doha round. Together, we're working to preserve peace, combat disease, and help ensure that all of Ghana's citizens can give their children what we all want for our children, a more hopeful future.
And so, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your friendship. I thank you for your leadership. I thank you for your kindness. And I offer a toast to you, your gracious wife, and to the noble people of Ghana. God bless.

Generalissimo Franco, Mrs. Franco, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished guests, and friends:
In 1953, our two nations embarked on a new course designed to increase cooperation and to enhance security. Our relationship is succeeding in its purposes in the past and at the present time. The independence of the West has been preserved. We have prospered in a manner that would have not been expected a quarter of a century ago. Our nations have both benefited.
Today's challenges, however, are much more complex. We must maintain strong and credible defenses while working to lessen tension. We live in a world that is becoming increasingly interdependent; cooperation becomes ever more important.
We are both proud of our independence, yet we recognize the need of working together. Each year marks increasing contacts, increasing cooperation between the Spanish and the American people in a growing number of fields ranging from medicine to urban development, to the arts, to agriculture, to science, and education.
To meet the needs of tomorrow, we must continue our cooperation, and I know this is a shared objective between your country and mine. As recognized in the 1974 Joint Declaration of Principles, our joint endeavor has strengthened the cause of peace. Through its bilateral defense cooperation with the United States, Spain is making a major contribution to the Western world.
Other nations of the transatlantic community have benefited from our cooperation, that of Spain and the United States. In our bilateral relations, we are prepared to draw practical consequences from these facts. We are both members of the international organizations created to increase cooperation among nations, such as the International Energy Agency. Such ties should be continually broadened to increase the strength of each, and we are determined that they will be.
Your Excellency, the warmth of your welcome today and the hospitality of the people of Spain has been very important to me and to my country. This delightful dinner in such splendid surroundings with so many friends has been the climax of a day filled with deeply moving experiences--from the demonstration of affection by the Spanish people who greeted us today, to renewing friendships with you and Prince Carlos, and exchanging ideas for the first time in a most profitable way with President Arias Navarro. Each were very rewarding experiences.
They are eloquent testimony to the depth of friendship between our two countries.
I lift my glass to Spain and to the United States, to our growing friendship in the years ahead, to Generalissimo Franco, to His Royal Highness Prince Juan Carlos, and to the Spanish people.
"
state-dinners,Franklin D. Roosevelt,"June 07, 1944","
I want to say how happy all of us are to welcome again to Washington the Prime Minister of Poland. I think he has arrived here at a very good time, because we have been able to have, even in the one hour this morning, a very frank talk about the future of Poland. Within his lifetime and mine we have seen the rebirth. In my boyhood and his, there was no independent Poland.
After he left me this morning, I had brought to me a series of sixteen maps, showing the map of Poland beginning in 1653. And it is rather an amazing fact that during these intervening years those sixteen maps show, first and last, that practically all of Central Europe was a part of Poland—first and last.
Therefore, it is rather difficult to untangle the map of the Poland which very soon we hope is going to have its own Government back. We hope the events of the past few days will result in the liberation of an independent Poland, with its own Government and its own democracy.
And yet we can't go by history, because if we were to take one Nation that I have in mind, Poland would include most of Russia, and a good part of Germany, and Czechoslovakia. We are not up to that time yet. We can't talk about it even.
We have got to do the practical thing. And that is what the Prime Minister and I have been talking about: the practical restoration of Poland as a country which will be not merely self-governing but self-maintaining, not merely with its own democracy, but also the wherewithal to make both ends meet in food and the cost of living. I think we are as one on it. I think we have a meeting of the minds as to the principles and the desires of the future for the people of Poland.
And I hope some time very soon that steps will be taken by which the people of Poland and the very large Nation that lies to the East will become not merely good neighbors- that is an essential'.—but also two Nations, one very, very large and the other a good deal smaller, that will be able to work out a mutual economic system by which there will be complete independence on the part of Poland.
At Teheran, I was very glad to have Marshal Stalin say, not once but several times, that he did not desire Poland to be an appendage of the Russian Soviet Republics but should, on the other hand, be a completely self-governing, large, and completely independent Nation.
Therefore, with that thought on the part of Marshal Stalin, I formed the conviction that sitting around the table and talking it over would do nobody any harm, that there can be a meeting of the minds, leaving out the smaller details, such as certain portions of what we call boundaries—deferring them until a somewhat later time, when this new disease in Europe will be eradicated by the march of time.
I think of shell shock. Three thousand miles away a good many people in the United States have got shell shock at the present time. If we were close to the actual fighting, or if there were German troops in our midst, I am inclined to think that our shell shock would be a great deal worse. And so some things must await the return of a word which I never liked and which a former President used: ""normalcy,"" when we can think rather more quietly, and think in the longer terms of what is going to happen, not next year or the year after, or even ten years hence, but fifty years and a hundred years hence.
We go back in our relations with Poland to well over 150 years in our struggle for independence. We were very greatly helped by leading Poles—who came over to help us from a sense of justice, from a sense of trying to help people who were trying to get self-expression—the great Polish heroes who helped us in our first Revolution. Through all the years we have watched a changing history, changing boundaries, changing designs.
I was saying to the Prime Minister that I go back to the last century, when I traveled over a large part of Europe on a bicycle, without a passport. I never carried a passport.
And I came to a barrier across the road, and a man came out, yawning, and wanted to know where I came from and where I was going.
I told him I was an American; and he said, after a few minutes of a few, very simple questions, ""Have you got enough money to live on?""
I said, ""Yes. I have ten pounds on the handlebars of my bicycle.""
Thereupon, he waved me through the barrier, and said, ""Hope you have a good time.""
There was a good deal of intermarriage, interchanging of ideas and friendship between the Nations of Europe then. Yet in the last fifty years that has all gone. It is a very sad thing about Europe, that that spirit has gone. It has become so nationalistic.
And yet we know there is the very great, one of the larger European Nations—Poland. It is right that they should continue to have their complete independence, and integrity, and the right spirit, because the spirit counts more than almost anything else.
And so the Prime Minister and I have been talking today and shall talk again tomorrow- something about the spirit of the future of Europe, getting away from the mere questions of whether this town will be on this side of the line or that side of the line. There is a bigger thing than that—and I am sure the Prime Minister agrees with me—it is not just a question of class or of land ownership, it is a question of the population of Poland.
The Prime Minister has always worked, all his life, for the health of the people at the ""bottom of the heap."" There is a great deal to do for them, still more in the future than in the past. And yet we in this country recognize the value of the Polish population, the thing that goes back to hundreds of years, the integrity of it, the good citizenship of it, the fact that they are not Poles in this country any more, they are Americans- Americans of Polish descent. That is why they are so very welcome when they come over here—to become Americans.
So I want to say again how very happy we are that the Prime Minister has come over here, and I hope he will come back, or that we will go over there and meet with the other members of his Government in London; and to meet the President of Poland, with whom I have never had the pleasure of close acquaintanceship yet, but who, as head of the Nation, still does represent a link which has been so welcome in America.
We are glad to have the Prime Minister with us, and I want to drink- we are all very happy to drink- to the health of the Prime Minister, and through him the President of Poland.

state-dinners,George Bush,"February 26, 1992","
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: Barbara and I are honored to have you join us here tonight. It is a particular pleasure to welcome to the United States our good friends and our neighbors from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Venezuela. I am delighted that we've gathered in my home State, Secretary Baker's home State of Texas, with our Governor here, the Mayor of this city here, in this gracious city of San Antonio. For centuries, San Antonio has stood as an important cultural crossroads of the Americas.
We meet at a time of great hope for all the people of the Americas. In almost every nation in the hemisphere, people enjoy self-government and respect for human rights. We're making steady progress to improve our people's quality of life through more open trade and investment, by creating more jobs. That's why I am committed more strongly than ever to completing the North American free trade agreement linking the economies of Mexico, Canada, and the United States. And building upon that, we will realize the vision I call the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative for robust trade and investment from the Arctic Ocean to the Straits of Magellan.
During our meetings this week in San Antonio, we will refine and intensify our common efforts against the menace of drugs. Each of our nations is making progress. Bolivia has successfully intensified its law enforcement efforts against cocaine traffickers. Peru has taken important steps to control airstrips used by traffickers to move cocaine to Colombia. Ecuador is moving against money launderers and traffickers on its territory. Colombia has jailed some of its most violent drug traffickers and is seizing record quantities of drugs. Venezuela is clamping down on those attempting to use its territory to ship drugs to Europe and America. Mexico has reduced cultivation of both opium poppies and marijuana by unprecedented amounts while seizing record amounts of cocaine through Operation Halcion.
For each of our nations, the battle against drugs is truly a war. The ultimate stakes are the same: the minds, bodies, and the souls of our young people, so many of whom have been hurt or destroyed by the violent world of the drug dealers. In the United States, we're stepping up treatment, prevention, and research programs, and we're toughening our prosecution and punishment of drug kingpins.
We're seeing results on the demand side as well. In the United States over the past 6 years, we've reduced the number of regular users of cocaine by two-thirds. Adolescent use of all types of illegal drugs is down. The number of high school seniors using illegal drugs is the lowest since we began measuring their drug use.
We must do more. Drug abuse and drug violence, particularly in our inner cities, threaten to destroy our children and everything else we hold dear. At risk is the civilization we share, our common inheritance, and our common future.
So, let us renew our resolve. Let us strengthen our commitment to guarantee all people drug-free communities. And as we work to advance the quality of life in our own hemisphere in so many ways, let us win a lasting victory in the war against drugs.
And once again, a warm welcome to San Antonio, Texas. And may God bless you and all the peoples of the Americas. And may I raise a glass in honor of our distinguished guests and the important mission that all of us share.

state-dinners,George Bush,"May 15, 1990","
President Bush. Mr. President and distinguished members of the Tunisian delegation, it's a great honor for Barbara and me to welcome you back to the White House -- a great pleasure, a personal pleasure.
We have some things in common. Before becoming President you were an ambassador. You come from a large family, in which you take great pride. You also take pride in physical fitness, and from a youthful passion for soccer to an interest in jogging today. And I'm told you like to keep your staffs jumping -- [laughter] -- by heading out onto the streets for surprise visits with your countrymen. You keep track of your Cabinet personally, using a home computer. Your home computer is called an Apple -- [laughter] -- mine is called John Sununu. [Laughter] Looking at you, I can't believe this, but I'm told that you take great pride in your role as a grandfather. You're a youthful one at that.
But in this country, the combination of grandchildren and computer games has produced some unexpected results. This is a true story, Mr. President. The most popular computer game in America is called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. [Laughter] Don't worry about the translation; it doesn't make any sense in English, either. [Laughter]
But tonight, in a more serious vein, I want to toast a leader who, with dignity and respect, took Tunisia through a critical transition in its history. President Ben Ali's peaceful and constitutional accession to power in 1987 really marked a turning point in Tunisia's history. He boldly but wisely chose the difficult path of political and economic reform.
Tunisia's greatness as a nation goes back to the earliest foundations of Mediterranean civilization. For centuries, Carthage dominated the western Mediterranean, rivaling the splendor and the power of Rome. And Tunisia today serves as a model of pragmatic change in the Arab world -- a country that looks to the future, not to the past; a country that has shunned the path of radicalism; a country that draws on the progressive tradition within its north African and Islamic heritage to address the challenges of a fast-changing world without, outside your borders. And you've already faced great challenges with the tenacious and pragmatic approach that we admire, and we will support you in your efforts.
Mr. President, in our welcoming ceremony this morning, I described the American military cemetery in Carthage, where nearly 3,000 brave Americans are buried in Tunisian soil. And let me conclude tonight with the words left on your shores by their commanding general, America's beloved President Eisenhower -- Ike -- when he spoke in Tunisia when he was President back in 1959.
Ike noted that he'd last visited your beautiful country exactly 16 years earlier, 1943, in the midst of a war that we thought would bring permanent peace. And he added -- and this is his quote -- ""We have found that peace does not come just because the guns are stilled. We have to work for peace. We have to work with our hearts, with our substance, with our hands. We have to work all the time to maintain the peace and to make it more secure.""
Mr. President, our talks here today reflect President Eisenhower's sentiments. They've strengthened the special friendship that is already deep and enduring; improved our understanding of each other's concerns; and laid the foundation for expanded cooperation and, yes, for expanded peace in the region and expanded peace in the world.
Earlier this morning, we enjoyed a glorious day out there on the South Lawn. And in Tunisia, it is common to compliment a visitor who brings rain. But because Washington has just weathered 2 weeks of rain, Mr. President, today we appreciate your bringing us the sunshine.
So, let me ask all of you to toast the health and success of President Ben Ali and the friendship between our two great nations. Welcome, Mr. President.
President Ben Ali. In the name of God, the clement, the merciful, Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to express to you, Mr. President, and to Mrs. Bush my thanks and gratitude for the warm welcome and kind hospitality extended to me personally and to the Tunisian delegation accompanying me. Such a warm reception sincerely reflects the mutual friendship and respect that characterize our traditional and sustained ties and represents a further step towards the consolidation of our common values of freedom, democracy, and defense of human rights.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the world is witnessing major radical changes in accordance with people's will and aspiration for freedom, democracy, and protection of dignity of individuals and of the community as a whole. Those changes reflect undoubtedly the common values that we both share. In fact, we have fully subscribed since November 7, 1987, to these very principles, as we are convinced that evolution is necessary as well as the fulfillment of the aspiration of the Tunisian people.
We have consequently reorganized the Tunisian society on a new basis to enable Tunisians to exercise their natural and legitimate rights and to live freely and democratically in a state of law and constitutional institutions. We are also committed to a policy of free market economy and open the way to private initiatives.
In view of the emergence of regional groupings and the need to find ways to deal with them, the Maghreb States have succeeded in establishing a union that I have presently the honor to chair and which is a great achievement, with a flexible and open structure which responds to the aspirations of the peoples of the region for cooperation and integrated development.
Mr. President, we have, on various occasions, called upon the international community to bring in a qualitative change in its relations, one taking into account the international detente and going beyond the international relations between advanced countries and developing ones to reach a more comprehensive concept designed for laying down a covenant for peace and progress that preserves the interests of all parties and brings about a new spirit of solidarity and justice. We believe that such an achievement is likely to provide the propitious climate which will give new impetus to the democratic process that has widely emerged on the international arena, ensure balanced development, protect our societies from the dangers of regression and extremism, and alleviate the tensions that threaten peace and security in the world.
Among the chronic factors of tensions within our region, in the Middle East and Africa, we have to mention the Palestinian-people issue and the conditions prevailing in South Africa. We believe that, owing to its weight, the position it enjoys, the influence it exerts, and its traditional and noble values, the United States can persuade Israel to respond positively to the bold initiatives taken by the Palestinian leadership and endorsed by Arab summits and to recognize the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. As to South Africa, while the situation is still a source of concern, despite the recent positive development, it is necessary that the international community should continue its support to leader Nelson Mandela's pledge to eradicate apartheid and build a society founded on equality and respect of democracy, standards, moral values, and international law.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, my visit to your country, with which we are maintaining a traditional and deep-rooted friendship, aims at strengthening and enhancing these relations for the benefit of our two countries, as we share a commitment to freedom and democracy and work for peace, security, and stability in the world on the basis of people's right for self-determination and solidarity between nations.
Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to stand up and join me in a toast in honor of the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush as an expression of our deepest appreciation for the feelings of friendship he expressed this morning to Tunisia -- a country he visited more than once -- and a tribute to the American people. Long live the Tunisian-American friendship. Thank you very much.

The President. Good evening, and welcome to the White House. Tonight we honor His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Sultan of Oman.
Some time ago the Queen of England awarded him the Knight Grand Cross of St. Michael and St. George on an order that was founded in 1818 with the motto: ""Token of a better age."" Well, Your Majesty, after spending time with you today and discussing serious matters of concern to both our nations, I can fully appreciate why our cousins in Great Britain paid you that compliment.
Those ancient orders of chivalry, however, tend to associate grace, decency, and other majestic qualities with the past, often the very distant past. But here, Your Majesty, on this side of the Atlantic we look for such traits in those around us because we seek first and foremost to build a better tomorrow. And it's clear that leaders like yourself—proud, yet humane individuals-will, indeed, make tomorrow a better age for mankind.
In my welcoming remarks this morning, I touched on a few of your many wonderful accomplishments. These were not products of a faint heart or indecision. Modern education systems, sophisticated health organizations, the infrastructure for economic progress don't just spring into existence, especially in so short a time. These advances are the result of hard work and good government. They reflect on extraordinary level of leadership; they reflect values which are deeply cherished here and reaffirm our high regard for the people of Oman and for you as an individual.
The Sultan's enthusiasm for building a well-functioning, modern country is a legend, but how many are aware of his enthusiasm for horses? Your Majesty, you probably know I enjoy riding, myself. With all your pressing responsibilities, I'm sure you agree that there is nothing so good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse. [Laughter] I also understand you have an appreciation for Gilbert and Sullivan, an interest that's shared by many here in America. Well, we can all be grateful that the Sun will never set on Gilbert and Sullivan.
But as much as Americans admire and identify with horsemanship and music, Your Majesty, we revere your personal courage and commitment even more. We're keenly aware that the progress you've made for your people was done in spite of a Communist-inspired, externally supported insurrection early in your reign. But you are not a man who is easily deterred.
In an interview you said, ""I go everywhere. I drive my own ear. I usually like to drive in the first ear of a convoy, because that way I can see more of my people and my country. And that's what I live for, and that's what I will die for.""
Your Majesty, I salute you. The American people are lucky to have you as a friend and proud to stand side by side with the people of Oman.
Thank you. God bless you.
The Sultan. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, honored guests:
I have been deeply touched by the warmth of the welcome you have extended to me this evening and by the generous words of appreciation with which you have referred to my country.
It is, indeed, a pleasure for me to visit your great city of Washington again. And this time to do so as a formal expression of the friendship and understanding which exists between our two countries.
As I am sure you are aware, the past decade has made heavy demands on Oman. Not only have the most sustained and intensive efforts had to be made in our determination to provide a better life for our people, but at the same time, we have fought to preserve our independence from foreign-inspired aggression.
Today, happily, that aggression has been defeated, and great strides have been made in the improvement of the quality of life of our people. But we are under no illusions. We realize that the important geopolitical position we occupy at the mouth of the gulf and the unstable situation that exists in the region make it imperative that we develop our country and its defenses to the maximum of our ability. This we are doing and shall continue to do.
We do not expect others to shoulder these burdens for us. We fight our own battles. But we realize that in the present state of the world no country can act in isolation, that a concerted effort must be made by the free world if freedom itself is not to be extinguished. We, therefore, look to our friends for their support, just as we offer ours to them in the trials and dangers that jointly face us. This is, therefore, Mr. President, why I particularly welcome this opportunity to acknowledge the valuable contribution which the United States has made and continues to make to the development and the interests of Oman.
The expert technical and other resources upon which we have been able to draw and the sustaining good will with which they have been provided has been of the greatest assistance in the work to improve the quality of life of my people and to safeguard the independence and territorial integrity of our country.
Mr. President, the inescapable burdens which lie upon your great country are, indeed, heavy. But your untiring work for peace and your active concern for the oppressed and underprivileged in this troubled world command the respect and admiration of all who place the destiny of humanity above cynical, political manipulation and exploitation. In this, your continued search for an acceptable and honorable solution is vital if the dangerous and intractable situation in the Middle East is to be resolved honorably and finally.
I have welcomed the opportunity to discuss this and other matters of mutual concern with you. And I believe that our frank and constructive exchange of views has made a real contribution to an understanding of the problems which face our two countries and has been a positive step towards their solution.
Mr. President, I should like to assure you that you have Oman's sympathetic support and understanding in the great work for peace and humanity of which you are engaged.
Thank you.

state-dinners,George Bush,"April 17, 1991","
President Bush. Ladies and gentlemen, we can get all this out of the way early. It is a distinct privilege for Barbara and me to salute this evening an extraordinary leader of honor, compassion, and courage.
With the greatest admiration, we welcome to the White House Nicaragua's President, Violeta Chamorro. Or, as I hear she was known by her growing family, or the family growing up, Madre Superiora. [Laughter] For those of you who don't speak good Spanish -- [laughter] -- that means ""Mother Superior."" For even as a young girl, Violeta could get her brothers and sisters standing at attention as she cracked her benevolent whip to get her family's house in order.
Well, now, this ""Mother Superior"" is getting her nation's house in order, and we honor her for it. We honor her as the conciliator who is forging a future of peace and unity for her beleaguered land, as the elected leader who ended a bitter civil war and who replaced a repressive and undemocratic regime, as the President whom history will acclaim as the liberator of not only her country's government but also of its heartbeat, its spirit.
Her people call her Dona Violeta, a name of affection and respect. And as I've come to know her I've understood, for she personifies the blend of resolve and compassion that inspires a nation to become the best it can be. I'll tell you something that impresses me. Not only is she working resolutely to bring about tangible reforms expanding democracy and economic opportunity, but she's also embarked on what she terms a quest to restore moral values. What a powerful goal in this age -- the most important goal there is.
And under the courageous and idealistic example of President Chamorro, Nicaragua is rediscovering the meaning of its coat of arms, the beautiful symbol embossed in the center of its flag: a triangle for equality, a rainbow for peace, and a shower of light for liberty shining throughout the land, liberty that's embodied by Violeta Chamorro and by her late husband and inspiration, Pedro Joaquin. He used to own a boat named Santa Libertad, glorious liberty.
Well, the world now watches as his widow steers her own Santa Libertad, her ship of state, bound for a bright horizon that promises freedom, respect, and dignity for every person in her land. On a shelf in President Chamorro's office is a plaque of a prayer she tries to live by. A prayer that, in fact, reminds me of her. The words are by St. Francis: ""Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred let me sow love. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. For it is in giving that we receive, and it is in pardoning that we are pardoned.""
Dona Violeta, you are an instrument of peace. Through your goals of reconciliation and liberty, you bring vision to your nation, you bring hope to the world. And so, may I ask that we rise and drink to the health -- Madam President, to your health and to that of your proud and courageous land. May God bless you.
President Chamorro. Please sit down. My dear friend, President of the United States of America, Mr. George Bush; her excellency, Mrs. Barbara Bush; ladies and gentlemen. Through an impressive worldwide plebiscite, the 20th century has taught us that one cannot build paradise by oppressing men and women. If there is to be happiness on Earth, there must first be liberty.
For almost a century, Nicaragua has struggled against dictatorships and militarism. It has fought for that sacred principle that gives men and women dignity and rights. Nicaragua has recovered its democracy. And I believe that we must complement this victory by reestablishing ties and a relationship with the nation that is the leader of democracy.
I am sure that you, my dear friend, Don George, who fought in World War II and lived through the horrors of war, share with me the anxious desire to banish violence. For it was violence that ended the life of my husband, Pedro Joaquin. I am sure that you share with me the desire to establish peace through dialog as well as new social paths with all sectors of the population.
That is why, Mr. President, we are going to build the 21st century from the painful experiences of this century so full of war and hatred. Our American democracies should serve as an example to the rest of the world of countries that are good and true neighbors. In the Americas of the future, there should be no division because the Americas are now the continent of hope.
Before concluding, my dear friends, Mr. President -- Don George, I would like to thank all of you for the warmth and kindness you've extended to me. I offer you my friendship. Wait. [Laughter]
Mr. President, I toast with you and with all of those present here to the permanent friendship between two democracies united by their common faith in liberty and the dignity of mankind. Thank you.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"November 17, 2000","
Mr. President, Madame Luong, distinguished representatives of the Vietnamese Government, ladies and gentlemen: Let me thank you for your welcome to me and to my family and to our entire American delegation.
We are honored to join you in writing a new chapter in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam and grateful that this chapter has a happy beginning. Yes, the history we leave behind is painful and hard. We must not forget it, but we must not be controlled by it. The past is only what precedes the future, not what determines it.
America and Vietnam are making a new history today. A generation from now, people will look back on this time and see the American veterans who came back to Vietnam searching for answers about the past and the Vietnamese who enlisted them in building a common future. They will see the young Vietnamese students, eager to absorb all the world has to offer, and the young Americans who have come here to learn with them. They will see the entrepreneurs and the scientists and the conservationists and the artists, forging links between Vietnam and the world.
In short, people will look back and reach the same conclusion as the great Vietnamese statesman Nguyen Trai when he said 500 years ago, ""After so many years of war, only life remains.""
Today, our people face a changing world and a changing life together, with the same basic aspirations and even some of the same worries. How can we seize the opportunities of a global economy while avoiding its turmoil? How can we open our doors to new ideas while protecting our traditions, our cultures, our way of life?
Globalization is bringing the world to Vietnam and also bringing Vietnam to the world. Films about life in Vietnam, from ""The Scent of the Green Papaya"" to ""The Three Seasons"" are winning awards all over the globe. The paintings of the Vietnamese artist Do Quang Em command fortunes at international art shows. The 200-year-old poems of Ho Xuan Huong are published in America, in English, in Vietnamese, and even in the original Nom, the first time ancient Vietnamese script has come off a printing press. Fashion designers like Armani and Calvin Klein base new collections on the traditional Vietnamese dress, the ao dai. Americans are tasting lemon grass, garlic chives, and even bitter melon, all of which, by the way, grow on a Vietnamese farm in our State of Virginia, just a 20-minute drive from the White House.
Mr. President, globalization also means that on the Internet, Americans can read the latest Vietnamese financial news or learn about the challenges in restoring Hanoi's Old Quarter or support the organizations working to preserve new species being found in the central highlands. It means we can download fonts in the Vietnamese language. Indeed, before long, sophisticated translation technologies will make the Internet a force for linguistic diversity, not uniformity.
When we open our doors, we not only let new ideas in; we let the talent and creativity and potential of our people out. That, too, will come to Vietnam. After just one day in your country, I am certain there will be no stopping the people of Vietnam as they gain the chance to realize their full potential. The people of the United States are happy that the time has come when we can be partners.
As ""The Tale of Kieu"" foretold, ""Just as the lotus wilts, the mums bloom forth; time softens grief; and the winter turns to spring."" Now the frozen images of the past have begun to thaw. The outlines of a warmer shared future have begun to take shape. Let us make the most of this new spring together.
I ask you to join me in a toast to the President of Vietnam, to Madame Luong, to the people of this great country, and to our future friendship together.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"November 22, 1994","
Ladies and gentlemen, President Kuchma, Mrs. Kuchma, members of the Ukrainian delegation, diplomatic corps, Ukrainian-Americans, and distinguished guests, tonight we meet to celebrate a new friendship between our two nations and a new freedom for the people of the Ukraine. We also celebrate our peoples' devotion to the shared values that produce peace and prosperity. In a time when it is tempting to take the easy way out, Ukraine has set for itself the highest goals.
Mr. President, people around the world admire you for your wisdom in leading your country toward a nonnuclear future, a move now heralded around the world. And we applaud your courage on embarking on the difficult path of economic reform, a path that holds the promise of turning the vast resources of your country into real prosperity. As you strive to build a peaceful and prosperous Ukraine, we will stand by you and work with you.
The Slavic root of the name Ukraine means ""borderland,"" but the independent Ukraine of today is at the very heart of Europe. It occupies a central place in our world. Our freedom and your freedom are bound together. We share the same desire to build a safer and better world for our children.
Mr. President, you are renowned as the man who ran Pivdenmash, the largest aerospace plant in the world. Just as you brought that vast operation to the pinnacle of technical excellence, we know you will be able to bring the hard work of reform down to earth and that you will deploy all your engineering skill to the construction of a new democratic nation. I might also add that a democratic Ukraine supports the idea of a democratic Russia, which is best for Russia, Ukraine, and the United States.
Let me close with a story. More than a century ago in the winter of 1858, the great Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko had just returned to St. Petersburg from internal exile in the Russian Far East. There he met the acclaimed American black actor Ira Aldridge, who was in the city performing Shakespeare. The son of Ukrainian serfs and the son of American slaves became fast friends. Theirs was a friendship born of shared ideals, above all the dream of freedom for all peoples. It was that dream that led Shevchenko to condemn despotism with the line, ""Freedom knows no dying."" Ira Aldridge was so impressed by his friend Shevchenko that it was said of him that forever after he carried Ukraine in his heart.
The steadfast devotion to freedom that brought Shevchenko and Aldridge together has also brought us together tonight. So I ask all of you to join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Kuchma, to the growing friendship of our peoples, and the bright future of a prosperous and free Ukraine.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"June 29, 2013","
Well, good evening, everyone. President Zuma, Madam Zuma, distinguished guests: Thank you for your incredible hospitality. When I was last here, as a Senator, my entourage was a little smaller. [Laughter] By that I mean no entourage. [Laughter] The Speaker just helpfully showed me a photograph of me and him from that first visit and pointed out that I had no gray hair in the photo—[laughter]—and that the years had taken their toll.
I also want to thank President Zuma's staff for making my staff feel much better, because this is not the first time that a President has come to the podium without notes—[laughter]—that were supposed to be there. And they are greatly relieved that that does not only happen to them. [Laughter]
Traveling to South Africa the first time was different because part of the thing about not having an entourage is it meant I could go take walks on the streets of Johannesburg and Soweto and Cape Town. And that's how you truly get to appreciate a country: the small interactions with shopkeepers or people who are willing to give you some directions. And I've never forgotten the beauty of this country, the warmth of its people. And tonight I am reminded of that again, and Michelle and I can't thank you enough.
I will not speak long. I have spoken enough today; I know Michelle heartily agrees. [Laughter] I will be giving another speech tomorrow about what this nation represents to me and about the future that I believe that we can build together.
I'm told that there's a word, a concept that has come to define the way many South Africans see themselves and each other. And I'm not sure it translates easily into English. But it's the recognition that, here on Earth, we're bound together in ways that are sometimes invisible to the eye; that there's a basic oneness to our humanity. It's the belief that we can only achieve true excellence and our full potential by sharing ourselves with each other, by caring for those around us. I believe that you call it Ubuntu.
And we feel that spirit tonight. We feel it in the lives of all those, including President Zuma, who endured the prisons and the beatings to end an unjust system so that we might stand here today in a free South Africa. And to President Zuma and to all of you who participated in that struggle, the world will always remember your sacrifice. It's a sacrifice that resonated in the United States in the same way that the U.S. civil rights movement helped to create bonds of solidarity with those in South Africa who were seeking their freedom.
We feel that spirit in the bonds between our two peoples that I think are unique in human history. I would not be here were it not for those freedom fighters, and I certainly would not be here if people weren't willing to fight for the principles that both our countries hold dear.
Now, America's founding principles—our belief that ""all men are created equal""—which would find expression in your Freedom Charter, which declared that this nation ""belongs to all who live in it, Black and White,"" with all people ""enjoying equal rights and opportunities."" In time, the tables turned. Just as I believe that many South Africans were inspired by people like Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, we drew inspiration from your struggle. And your success reminded us that all things were possible, including the improbable idea that a son of an African man might even become an American President.
And we feel that spirit—Ubuntu—tonight because, we must admit, our minds and our hearts are not fully here because a piece of us, a piece of our heart is with a man and a family who is not far away from here. Much has been said about Madiba today. More will be said in the years to come. This evening I'd simply like to close with the words that he turned to so often himself, in that cell, the poem he read to the others in their darkest moments to give them strength:
Out of the night that covers me,Black as the Pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.
In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.
Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.
And so I propose a toast: To a man who has always been a master of his fate, who taught us that we could be the master of ours; to a proud nation and South Africa's unconquerable soul; and to President Zuma and Madam Zuma for their outstanding leadership in carrying on the great traditions of the South African struggle. Pula!

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"April 02, 1978","
GENERAL OBASANJO. President Jimmy Carter and Mrs. Carter, distinguished guests:
It gives me great pleasure and satisfaction, Mr. President, to once again welcome you and Mrs. Carter to Nigeria on behalf of the Government of Nigeria and in the name of the entire people of our country.
Your presence with us, historic in itself as the first state visit ever undertaken by a President of the United States of America to this part of the world, is of unique significance.
It is also gratifying that you are visiting Nigeria so soon after my own visit to your great country, thus affording us the opportunity to reciprocate, even in a modest way and in the traditional African manner, the warmth of the reception, the generosity, and the meticulous care and attention which were accorded me and my delegation during our visit to your country.
In the conduct of international relations today, direct, personal contacts and consultations among those who are charged with the responsibilities of guiding the affairs of their respective nations are a vital instrument for promoting international understanding and respect for one another's views and positions. We are pleased for this opportunity, offered by your visit, to continue the dialog and exchange of views on the various matters of mutual interest to our two countries which were initiated in the course of my visit to the United States.
Our discussion then, as now, centered on our joint search for international peace and stability; the restructuring of interstate relations to ensure freedom, understanding, and justice, as well as a more equitable economic quota between the rich and the poor nations; the improvement of fundamental human rights and the dignity of man everywhere, whatever his race, color, or creed.
We believe that in our efforts to attain these goals, every nation has an obligation to fulfill and a contribution to make, irrespective of size, circumstance, or geopolitical status. To many of us in Nigeria, and, if I may venture to say, in Africa generally, the United States as a nation evokes sentiment of admiration, since your country has come a long way from casting away the yoke of colonialism to building a relatively free, united, and strong society, where the freedom of the individual and his rights remain supreme.
This strength of your society lies not merely in the breathtaking capacity of its astronauts, nor in America's unequaled mastery of the skills of science and technology, not even so much in the quality of life, but, above all, in the constant endeavor to live up to the ideals of its Founding Fathers.
I believe many will accept and agree that herein lies the greatest attribute of the American society.
Besides, Mr. President, the continuing American aspiration and contribution to the noble ideals of social justice and human liberty, at home and abroad, have made its influence felt within your borders and across the vast seas and far-flung frontiers of states.
The search for these noble ideals is a never-ending process, whether in developed societies like yours or in developing societies like ours.
Your personal commitment to decent human values and service to mankind is not in doubt. We remember with admiration that your mother, Miss Lillian, at the age of 70, did serve with the Peace Corps in India in 1968, long before you became the President. This deep-rooted family concern for humanity has provided the inner strength of your own personal sincerity on matters of human and civil rights and underlies the understanding of our two Governments on issues affecting the life and dignity of the black man.
Mr. President, we consider it, therefore, a logical development that Africa should now occupy its rightful place in the heart of America's foreign policy.
In your brief stay in this capital city of Lagos, you will perhaps already have gained some impression of some of the urgent and critical problems with which we are coping in our endeavor to build up Nigeria into a progressive and virile society, not only with a strong economic base but one founded on respect and dignity for human values.
We have assiduously embarked on the implementation of a political program that will lead to a stable, dynamic, and elected democratic political system where the weak and the strong will equally feel secure and protected.
On the economic front, our program is designed not only to provide a firm and strong industrial base but also to progressively gain control of the commanding heights of our economy and to spread the fruits of development evenly through our society.
In this challenging enterprise we have always welcomed and we will continue to welcome the understanding and active cooperation and collaboration of all genuine friends from outside our borders. And we will continue, as we have done in the past, to ensure security of all investments made in our economy, in accordance with our laws and our regulations.
We share in common with the rest of the developing world the usual disabilities of inadequate food and shelter, weak economic structures, poor health facilities, mass illiteracy, lack of an adequate technological base, and an unflattering human environment—all mainly caused by colonialism.
While we count our own modest achievements in our struggle for development, we can only do so in marginal and relative terms. Besides, our low level of development stands out in bold relief, because we live in a continent where poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, disease, and squalor are the rule, rather than the exception, and where a majority of the least developed nations in the world are found.
The development objectives and achievements of Nigeria, therefore, cannot be viewed in isolation from continental obligations and situations on the one hand, and internationally acceptable definition of development on the other.
On the political plane, Mr. President, one outstanding and most welcome development in contemporary relations between Nigeria and your great country, particularly since the inception of your administration, as I had occasion to say when I welcomed you in Dodan Barracks, is the growing contact and consultation between us.
As a result of this development, you are now, no doubt, better equipped to understand the reason for our persistent reference to the grave threat to international peace and security caused by the explosive situation in the southern part of Africa.
For obvious reasons, and by virtue of our position, we cannot remain indifferent while the racists in southern Africa oppress, repress, and subject to inhuman degradation the overwhelming majority of the indigenous people of the area and deny them the most basic human rights and elementary freedoms.
You will, no doubt, understand and appreciate, therefore, our uncompromising insistence on dismantling the present inhuman systems in southern Africa in favor of a fair and just society.
From all indications our two Governments share identical views in this regard, which I believe is perfectly understandable, judging by your own country's great struggles, soon after its foundation, for the attainment of these same ideals.
In our endeavors to achieve these goals, our choice of means and methods and our precision of timing may differ. But from our exchange of views from this visit, we are convinced that our common desires and dedication to the task cannot be called in doubt. On our part, we shall therefore continue to extend all necessary moral and material assistance to the victims of injustice, oppression, and apartheid in southern Africa.
I believe, also, that it is pertinent to mention our deep concern about the present level of foreign collaboration with the South African regime, particularly in economic and military matters, which tend to sustain the apartheid machinery of repression and persecution of the majority, indigenous African population. Your country's little gestures of disengagement in this regard are welcome, and we hope, Mr. President, that they mark the beginnings of a realization that, put together, black Africa as a whole offers wider economic possibilities as an alternative choice than South Africa alone, and that without a peaceful change of policy of apartheid now, any investment in South Africa is a risky and insecure investment.
In Zimbabwe, your country and the British colonial authority have, over the past 1 year, embarked together on a search for a durable, just, and acceptable settlement, leading to an early transfer of power to the majority population of the land.
We have joined those who believe that the Anglo-American proposals for a peaceful settlement ought to be given a chance, and we were quick to say so. This we have done because we believe that these proposals contain sufficient positive elements to serve as bases for bringing about true independence in Zimbabwe, and we think it will not be wise to throw away the baby with the bath water.
We expressed our concern when it appeared to us that these proposals were not being pursued with as much candor and enthusiasm as Africa had hoped. With total rejection of the so-called internal settlement of Ian Smith by the world community, and your personal continued support for the Anglo-American proposals, we are gratified to note that the proposals are back on the rails once again.
We assure you of our positive support in the search for an early establishment of unqualified democracy in a truly independent Zimbabwe. Similarly, in Namibia, we are encouraged to note the positive role which the United States of America is playing in collaboration with other Western powers to usher in an era of independence and so end South Africa's illegal military occupation.
We stand firmly by SWAPO in their struggles for the freedom of their fatherland, and we also pledge to work ceaselessly to see that peace and justice return to that part of our continent in the context of true independence.
We believe that a truly independent Namibia and a South Africa, rid of the inhuman policy of apartheid, can live together as good neighbors in harmony and cooperation.
As you will be fully aware, our newly independent states in Africa have not been spared the ordeal of spending their meager resources in the prosecution of fratricidal and often futile wars, in many cases with encouragement by powers from ideological camps outside the continent who are seeking ideological, economic, and strategic spheres of influence.
It is Africa's desire to settle her own disputes our own way, if necessary under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity.
While we are naturally preoccupied with peace and security in the African continent in the first instance, I believe the point is worth emphasizing here that Africa is equally interested in the current efforts at detente between East and West, as this is the only dependable means of ensuring peace and stability in the world and development all around, especially in new states. For the same reasons, we are vitally interested in an early restoration of just and durable peace in the Middle East.
On the question of world peace, Mr. President, what applies to Africa in terms of congenial atmosphere and conditions for development applies equally to the rest of the developing world generally. The problems of development of these countries are of such immense dimensions that they demand global perspectives and strategies because, as we have all seen, the conventional and piecemeal approach of donors and receivers of aid and technical assistance has proved itself totally inadequate. A completely fresh approach, therefore, may serve to emphasize the interdependence of our resources and, hopefully, also stem the tide of deep frustration that now pervades the underprivileged half of the world and which the developed world sees as lack of opposition of their efforts.
We believe in this regard that what we require is a fundamental restructuring of the international economic system to modify drastically and modernize the rules governing international trade, access to markets and development capital, the unimpeded flow of technology, and a demonstration of a greater sense of commitment and political will on the part of all concerned to concretize the demands of a new international economic order.
Unfortunately, there has so far been no demonstrable evidence of that sense of commitment or even of concern at international forums, where discussions are currently proceeding on relief for the least developed countries, or agreement on an acceptable form of common fund to provide a mechanism for ensuring uninterrupted and regular flow of earnings for the exports of the Third World.
Your country, Mr. President, has the necessary capacity and the influence and is well placed to play a leading role in this regard. We can bring the developed and developing worlds together in the harmonious cooperation to inspire reforms and to adopt new development initiatives.
We share your concern about the dangerous, high level of armament and about the enormous economic resources consumed by the armament race.
We continue to follow the progress of the strategic arms limitation talks, and we hope that there will be an early agreement that will lead to a reduction in the production and stockpiling of armaments and subsequent freeing of more resources of the world for social programs that will directly lead to improvement of quality of life, especially in developing countries.
Mr. President, let me end by saying once again what a great pleasure it has been for the Nigerian Government and people to welcome you and Mrs. Carter. We hope that even in spite of its brevity, your visit has nevertheless offered you some closer, personal insight into our conditions and our way of life.
As you leave our shores after this historic visit to Africa, you do so, Mr. President, with the sincere good wishes of the Government and people of Nigeria and the appreciation of the value of your memorable visit here.
Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to kindly join me in drinking a toast to the United States of America, to the strengthening of relations and friendship between the Nigerian and American peoples, and to the personal good health and well-being of President Jimmy Carter and Mrs. Carter.
THE PRESIDENT. General Obasanjo and distinguished officials of the Military Government of Nigeria, officials from other countries, including our own, and ladies and gentlemen, and friends:
Yesterday I had an opportunity to speak at your great civic center to several thousand people assembled there by the Institute on Political Studies. I spelled out the position of our own Nation as it relates to the interrelationship between ourselves and Nigeria, and to Africa, in particular, among the other continents and communities of the world.
So tonight, I would like to refer more personally to my impressions of the visit that I have had with General Obasanjo.
I noticed when the entertainment was introduced, the first statement made was, ""No one knows where we go when we die."" General Obasanjo and I have discussed our future when we die as political leaders in a few years, and— [laughter] since we both come from great peanut-producing nations, we decided we would go into a farming partnership. [Laughter] I'll share my farm with him in Georgia, and he'll have to share some farmland with me in Nigeria. And we'll have a chance to travel back and forth to learn to like each other even more and to get better acquainted even with the people in our two countries.
I also noticed that the ancient custom of not being able to tell an oba bad news is one that I would really appreciate as President of the United States. [Laughter] The only problem is I'm afraid that no one would ever have a chance to talk to me about anything, because bad news is all I have a chance to talk about as President of our country. [Laughter]
We have formed a good relationship, a friendly one, one based not just on serious things but on discussions that show that we are at ease with one another. And we share the responsibilities of leadership of two of the great nations of the world.
Today when I was getting ready to leave for Tin Can Island, I invited General Obasanjo to go with me on the trip. He said he couldn't stand to go and look at how much money Nigeria was spending on new port facilities. But when I got there and saw the tremendous new capabilities that Nigeria has now opened up to trade with the rest of the world, I realized what a wise government Nigeria has and how the present investments will pay rich dividends in the future.
Your growth has been extraordinary, very rapid. And I know, even from a nation that has been in existence now for more than 200 years, how difficult it is to deal with rapid change and rapid growth and a yearning among our people for a better life, a proper distribution of wealth and opportunity. And these are the kinds of things that we learn, one from another.
As I mentioned in church this morning, I first began to learn about Nigeria more than 40 years ago, as we studied in a small Baptist church in my town in Georgia about the common religious faith that aroused our interest as Christians in your country. We are a highly diverse nation with a wide range of religious beliefs, as are you. But there is a fundamental faith in a higher authority on which we've predicated our laws, our customs, our beliefs, and our hopes and confidence in the future.
This is one thing that binds us together, and it has done it for many ages in the past, and it will be a basis for a common purpose and a common sharing of life in the future.
We've had a chance during the few hours we've been here—1, my wife, my little daughter—to learn about the ancient culture of Nigeria, much more advanced than ours, beautiful artifacts of 2,000 or more years ago, where you had an already existing culture, well based on the intelligence and the beauty of your people's minds, that has existed down to the present day. And I believe it's accurate to say that when a county is dynamic, is growing, is struggling, is challenged on occasion—as Andy Young said yesterday, it's when we learn to appreciate our ancient culture, our roots, and our past even more.
You have much to be admired, and we have new things as well from which we can learn and teach one another. There is a growing participation of your people in government, and I've never known a more idealistic approach to the future in government than the one that now is being considered by your constitutional body as you write a set of permanent laws to guide your nation toward absolute, true democracy very shortly in the months ahead.
This will indeed be an inspiration to the whole world. You've also had a common experience with us of overthrowing colonial rule, and even after that, as did we, experiencing a very tragic civil war.
I doubt that there's been a case in history when, after a deeply divisive war, more immediate and successful attempts were made to bind a nation back together and to heal the wounds of that division. And all the people in this room, and particularly the leaders of the military government, can be congratulated for the recovery from your tragic war.
This is something that we've shared and we know very well in the southern part of the United States. I think your national motto, ahead of me on your emblem, ""Unity. and Faith,"" is a very fine, constant reminder of what you have cherished in the past, what you have in the present, and what you will have in the future.
There's another thing that we share-us with a newness and you, also, with a newness of approach—and that is tremendous international influence. You are a powerful nation. You are a strong nation. You're a large nation. And you have a very influential nation.
I think the fairness and the benevolence of your attitude is increasing on a daily basis the confidence of other leaders of the world in the Nigerian leaders. It's obvious that in spite of your strength, your relative wealth, your military prowess and force, and the size of your population, you have nothing but a good attitude toward your immediate neighbors and the other countries of Africa.
And it's indeed a reassuring thing for me, as a President of the United States, to have a sense of partnership and an opportunity to have the counsel and advice from the leaders of your great country. We have discussed in the last 2 days some of the most difficult areas of the world, where peace and good will does not exist, but where our influence, combined with yours and others, might correct those defects in the relationship among neighboring peoples.
We've discussed our talks with the Soviet Union. We've discussed our efforts in the Middle East to bring the Israelis and the Arab countries and peoples together for a permanent peaceful settlement. We've talked about the Horn of Africa, where you, again, are playing a leading role. We've discussed Zimbabwe—as General Obasanjo has already described—our efforts and the British efforts jointly, working under the principles of international law and the United Nations, guided by the frontline Presidents, by General Obasanjo and others, to do the right thing in Africa, constantly being reminded of the need for rapid action and learning from you how that rapid action might be ensured. This is very beneficial to us, to you, to all the countries in Africa, indeed, the world.
We've also learned a great deal about the attitude of people in Namibia, your closeness with SWAPO and its leaders, our influence, along with other Western nations, in inducing South Africa to deal fairly with the people in Namibia under the auspices of and in compliance with United Nations resolutions. And our abhorrence of racial prejudice, discrimination, and apartheid has been demonstrated again here, and our strength of commitment against this blemish on Africa has been renewed and strengthened by our discussions with the great Nigerian leaders.
Together, I believe we can bring a change that will make all of us proud in Africa in the months and the years ahead.
The last thing I would like to say is this: The bilateral relationships with your country is of great benefit to the United States. You're .one of our most important trading partners. And as I spoke at the Institution on Political Affairs yesterday, the director of that Institute told me afterwards, among the 3,500 or so people there, that more than half of them in the audience had had at least part of their education in the United States. We learn as much from you as you learn from us.
In the field of agriculture, we see a new era of additional consultation, mutual work, mutual learning, mutual benefit. So, the tremendous potential of your country can be used not only to feed your own people but to export to an increasingly hungry world, because land can no longer be wasted, and your tremendous natural resources in land, with which God has blessed you, can be used much more efficiently in the future and will benefit not only us but others who look to you for meeting their growing needs.
We are a great technological nation, highly advanced, and only with the investment of our technology in growing nations like your own can we benefit economically in the future. This is important to us as well.
And, of course, our mutual trade gives our own people a better life, materials which we must have for a good life for American citizens and, in the process, makes it possible for you to prosper again economically.
I'm particularly proud at the personal friendship that has been shown to us by the people of Nigeria. We arrived here in the middle of the night, and we were surprised and deeply moved at the number of average, happy, welcoming Nigerian people who stood along the highway to let us know that they cared for me, cared for the United States and what our Nation stands for. It's an experience which I shall never forget.
And this has been mirrored in countless encounters between myself and your people, my wife Rosalynn and your people, and my little daughter, Amy, and your young people, which has meant so much to us already.
This is a trip that I will never forget the rest of my life. I hope that I might come back again. And I hope that General Obasanjo can continue to share with me his wisdom and his judgment, derived from you, and his knowledge of this great country and this great continent.
In closing, I would like, on behalf of the people of one of the greatest nations on Earth, the United States, to propose a toast to a great leader, General Obasanjo, and to the people of one of the greatest nations on Earth, the people of Nigeria.

state-dinners,George Bush,"April 29, 1992","
President and Mrs. von Weizsacker, Barbara and I are just delighted, we are honored to welcome you here as the first President of a united Federal Republic of Germany. You are known the world over as a man who embodies the values that have made Germany's unity and democracy a source of hope to the world. President von Weizsacker, throughout an era of division you constantly stood for unity, the unity of the German people, the unity of Europeans, East and West, and the unity and brotherhood, before God, of all mankind.
We are also honored that Foreign Minister Genscher, who just announced that he is stepping down from the position he's held with such distinction for 18 years, is with us, together with Mrs. Genscher. Hans-Dietrich, now, where is he? I'm looking, looking, looking. Over here. [Laughter] Hans-Dietrich, thank you, sir, for your fantastic service, for your friendship, and for all you have done for our common good. We are delighted that you are with us.
To all our German friends, let me say that we rejoiced with you a year and a half ago as Germany was united once more in peace and freedom. At midnight, the exact moment when two countries became one, Berlin's liberty bell pealed triumphantly. And we were proud to share in the glory of that moment since the bell, a replica of our own Liberty Bell, was a gift from the American people offered in friendship and support.
Mr. President, those half million people crowded around the Reichstag that night will always remember the words that you proclaimed as the bell rang, and here it is: ""We want to serve world peace in a united Europe."" Americans thrilled with you at that moment, we really did. And German unification, which for so long seemed so far away, so distant, was but one of the German miracles we've seen in our lifetimes.
There is, of course, Germany's legendary economic miracle. But I'm thinking of something else, your country's moral revival, of the patience and spirit of reconciliation that it took to create a climate of cooperation in a Europe burdened with bitterness.
Just as Germany has transcended and triumphed over its past, so has the German-American relationship shed the burdens that were history's legacy. United Germany, champion of a more united Europe, now stands as our partner in leadership. Together, we have achieved our common goal of a Germany united in peace and freedom. But our partnership did not end with that. To the contrary, now that we are free of the dangers and divisions of Europe's cold war confrontation, the German-American partnership has really just begun.
The world around us has changed almost beyond recognition. And we cannot know precisely where these revolutionary changes will take us. But this we do know: Our principles have not changed, for they have been proven right. And we are confident, for our shared values and unity of purpose have guided us through our past and will continue to guide us in our future.
Barbara and I speak proudly for this country when we call on everyone here to celebrate the promise our relationship holds. It's a relationship that this city, led by the Kennedy Center, whose Mr. Jim Wolfensohn is with us tonight, is commemorating with an unprecedented salute to 300 years of German culture, a festival under our joint patronage.
Now, in that spirit of cultural excellence, we have a present for you. There's a slogan in America, and it's particularly appropriate during a political year: If you want a friend, get a dog. [Laughter] And so in the spirit of enduring friendship, we'll give you the translation, the German translation. And I will now read it to you:
[At this point, President Bush read the German title of the translation of ""Millie's Book as Dictated to Barbara Bush"" which he presented to President von Weizsacker.]
And may I suggest that we all raise our glasses: To unity, to freedom, to the new Germany. And to the long life and good health of our honored friend, President von Weizsacker, and his wife, Mrs. von Weizsacker. To your health, sir, and to the great friendship between Germany and the United States.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 07, 1985","
Your Majesties, 1985 is a year laden with anniversaries of great historical significance. It was 500 years ago that Christopher Columbus and his son Diego came to Spain seeking support for a voyage of exploration. Much will be said about this as we prepare to celebrate 7 years from now, the quincentennial discovery of the Americas. Yet it's not so much the voyage but rather the decision to make the voyage that we should commemorate.
The skills of the captains and sailors, although vital to success, were less significant than the genius of Columbus and the vision of Queen Isabella. Though besieged with serious challenges, the Spanish throne overcame the doubters and cynics and thus opened a golden age for Spain and a new chapter in human history.
It gives me great pleasure to be with you this evening to applaud another decision of courage and vision, the decision to chart for Spain a course to democracy. The Spanish Crown played a significant role in this historic turning point as well. Your dedication and ideals, Your Majesties, have earned the respect and gratitude of freedom-loving peoples everywhere.
And since your national journey to freedom began, talented leaders have emerged, and the Spanish people have nobly risen to this occasion. Your Majesty, we know that the President and the other leaders of Spain in and out of government have brought Spain peacefully and, yes, gracefully into the family of democratic nations. The American people admire you, and they admire your great achievements. Having been a republic for 200 years we Americans know full well that the road of freedom is not always easy, yet there is every reason to be optimistic. As Sancho proclaimed in Cervantes' ""Don Quixote,"" ""A stout heart breaks bad luck."" After seeing your nation make dramatic and fundamental change, remaining ever true to the humane values at the core of representative government, no one can doubt that Spain indeed has a stout heart and that because of it your luck will be good.
Because of the efforts of your generation, Spain is no longer isolated on the Iberia Peninsula but is now a vital and growing influence among the free nations of the world. New doors of opportunity are opening, especially in the area of trade and international investment. During these last 40 years, the Western nations have enjoyed tremendous benefit from a relatively free and open trading system. That's why I'm pleased to see Spain becoming a full partner in the European Community, moving to further open the door of economic cooperation with other free countries.
Your Majesty, we would like to work with Spain to keep international trade open and fair. America believes in free people, free markets, and free trade. Increasing the level of exchange between countries serves the interest of all. Trade and investment create a healthy interdependence between free peoples and expand opportunity and unleash new potential. The benefits of trade have been particularly clear as we've seen a vigorous American economy help serve as an engine for progress, pulling the economies of Europe into better times.
Of course, ultimately, whether a country prospers will depend on its domestic policies. Each nation must follow its own path, but I hope the progress that we've made in the United States might encourage others. Instead of trying to redistribute existing wealth, we've tried to produce more. Instead of imposing more controls and regulations, we've sought to free our peoples entrepreneurial spirit. Instead of channeling more of our resources into bureaucracy, we've sought to expand private investment.
The result has been solid growth and low inflation. Almost 8 million new jobs have been created in the United States in the last 2 years.
Your Majesties, the United States has much for which to be grateful to Spain. Our Southwest was settled by pioneers from your country, and a rich Hispanic heritage is still part of our way of life in my adopted home State of California. Today, as Spain takes its place with the democratic nations, I predict the relationship between our peoples will grow and bear fruit as never before.
One of the reasons for my visit to the European Continent is to commemorate the end of the Second World War, that monstrous conflagration that engulfed much of the world. It would be easy to talk in times like this of the heroism of battle and the sacrifice of those who died. Well, instead I've tried to mark this as an anniversary of the beginning of 40 years of peace. For free people, peace is the most precious possession, second only to the preservation of their own liberty. Peace magnifies the joys and meaning of life; it permits the resources of a country to be directed to those productive endeavors that add to well-being and happiness. Everyone is better off when the blessings of peace are enjoyed by a free people. As Cervantes said, ""When God sends the dawn, He sends it for all.""
But peace doesn't happen on its own. All free people share the responsibility of maturing it, nurturing it, investing in it, taking careful thought, and doing what is necessary to preserve it.
As is fitting, the choice about Spain's contribution to Western security is wholly in Spain's hands. Your decision will be respected. I would say only that the people of the United States would be proud to have the people of Spain continue to stand beside us and the other members of the alliance in our collective, noble effort to preserve the peace and protect human liberty. We believe the peace can and will be preserved by the collective strength of the Western democracies. And if we're strong, we need not be afraid to negotiate with any potential adversary.
The United States is now engaged in arms talks in Geneva. We're seeking not just arms control but an actual reduction in the level of nuclear arsenals. I'm pleased to note that Spain is part of the Western efforts in Stockholm to negotiate a lessening of the tensions between East and West.
The United States is also moving forward on a research project that could use new technologies to diminish the threat of nuclear missiles and lead mankind into a happier and safer time. Our Strategic Defense Initiative is aimed at finding new means for deterring war. It's not based on the threat of nuclear retaliation, but on the contribution of a nonnuclear defense system that would be capable of destroying missiles and incapable of threatening people. By making missiles less of a threat, we hope to make them easier to give up and thus make arms reduction agreements more likely.
Ortega y Gasser once wrote, ""Nations are formed and are kept alive by the fact that they have a program for tomorrow."" Well, the program for the future of the Western democracies is peace, progress, and freedom.
Today Spain is moving forward in a voyage of freedom and democracy, every bit as courageous as that of Columbus. Spain can be confident of the outcome because the future is on the side of the free. Things that are today beyond the imagination of dictators and tyrants will be conceived of and made reality by free men and women. This we can count on. It is when people can speak and pray, work for themselves, live without fear of repression that the most potent force on this planet is energized-the genius and power of free people under God.
Your Majesties, today let us be grateful for that love of liberty deeply rooted in the soul of our people. Yes, its fire will light the way to a future more glorious than the golden age of yesteryear. We're building a new world of peace, progress, and freedom.
And I now ask all of you to join me in a toast to His Majesty the King and to the people of Spain, all champions of democracy.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 30, 1988","
The General Secretary. Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, comrades, I welcome you in the Moscow Kremlin. For five centuries, it has been the site of events that constituted milestones in the life of our state. Decisions crucial to the fate of our nation were made here. The very environment around us is a call for responsibility to our times and contemporaries, to the present and to the future.
It is here that we wish to emphasize the importance of the newly discovered truth that it is no longer possible to settle international disputes by force of arms. Our awareness of the realities of the present-day world has led us to that conclusion. I like the notion of realism, and I also like the fact that you, Mr. President, have lately been uttering it more and more often.
Normal and, indeed, durable Soviet-American relations, which so powerfully affect the world's political climate, are only conceivable within the framework of realism. Thanks to realism, for all our differences, we have succeeded in arriving at a joint conclusion which, though very simple, is of historic importance: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Other conclusions follow with inexorable logic. One of them is whether there is any need for weaponry which cannot be used without destroying ourselves and, indeed, all of mankind. I believe the realization of this became Reykjavik's pivotal idea.
Our Warsaw treaty allies firmly adhere to this position. This is our powerful support in all matters related to nuclear disarmament. They have given the Soviet leadership a clear mandate to negotiate radical nuclear arms limitations and reductions with the United States. My talks with leaders of Socialist countries and with authoritative representatives of other nations make it clear to me that there is a common desire to overcome military confrontation and to end the race in both nuclear and conventional arms.
To this, it should be added that a realistic approach is making a way for itself in all directions and on all continents. And the idea of resolving today's problems solely by political means is gaining increasing authority. There is an ever-broadening desire of the most diverse political and social forces for dialog, for exchanges, for better knowledge of each other, and for mutual understanding. If this is indeed so, if this is the will of the peoples, an effort is needed to ensure that the stocks of the ferment of realistic policies keep growing and never run out. For that, it is essential to understand each other better, to take into account the specific features of life in various countries, the historical conditions that shape them, and the choice made by their peoples.
I recall the words you once spoke, Mr. President, and I quote: ""The only way to resolve differences is to understand them."" How very true. Let me just add that seeking to resolve differences should not mean an end to being different. The diversity of the world is a powerful wellspring of mutual enrichment, both spiritual and material.
Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, the word perestroika does not sound anachronistic, even within these ancient walls, for renewal of society, humanization of life, and elevated ideals are—at all times and everywhere—in the interests of the people and of each individual. And when this happens, especially in a great country, it is important to understand the meaning of what it is going through. It is this desire to understand the Soviet Union that we are now seeing abroad. And we regard this as a good sign because we do want to be understood correctly. This is also important for civilized international relations. Everyone who wants to do business with us will find it useful to know how Soviet people see themselves.
We see ourselves even more convinced that our Socialist choice was correct, and we cannot conceive of our country developing without socialism—based on any other fundamental values. Our program is more democracy, more glasnost, more social justice with full prosperity and high moral standards. Our goal is maximum freedom for man, for the individual, and for society. Internationally, we see ourselves as part of an integral civilization, where each has the right to a social and political choice, to a worthy and equal place within the community of nations.
On issues of peace and progress, we believe in the primacy of universal human values and regard the preservation of peace as the top priority. And that is why we advocate the establishment of a comprehensive system of international security as a condition for the survival of mankind. Linked with this is also our desire to revive and enhance the role of the United Nations on the basis of the original goals, which the Soviet Union and the United States, together with their allies, enshrined in the charter of that organization. Its very name is symbolic: the United Nations—united in their determination to prevent new tragedies of war, to banish war from international relations, and to affirm just principles securing a worthy life for any nation, whether large or small, strong or weak, rich or poor.
We want to build contacts among people in all forums, to expand and improve the quality of information, and to develop ties in the spheres of science, culture, education, sports, and any other human endeavor. But this should be done without interfering in domestic affairs, without sermonizing or imposing one's views and ways, without turning family or personal problems into a pretext for confrontation between states. In short, our time offers great scope for action in the humanitarian field. Nations should understand each other better, know the truth about each other, and free themselves from bias and prejudice.
As far as we know, most Americans, just like us, want to get rid of the demon of nuclear war; but they, just like us, just like all people on Earth, are becoming increasingly concerned over the risk of environmental disaster. Such a risk can only be averted if we act together. Increasingly urgent is the truly global problem of the economic state of the world—in the North and South, in the West and East of this planet. The economic foundation of civilization will be destroyed unless a way is found to put an end to the squandering of funds and resources for war and destruction, unless the problem of debt is settled and world finances are stabilized, unless the world market becomes truly worldwide by incorporating all states and nations on an equal footing.
It is across this spectrum of issues that we approach international affairs and, of course, our relations with the United States of America. We are motivated by an awareness of the realities and imperatives of the nuclear and space age, the age of sweeping technological revolution when the human race has turned out to be both omnipotent and mortal. It was this awareness that engendered the new thinking, which has made possible a conceptual and practical breakthrough in relations between us as well.
Mr. President, this meeting, while taking stock of a fundamentally important period in Soviet-American relations, has to consolidate our achievements and give new impetus for the future. Never before have nuclear missiles been destroyed. Now we have an unprecedented treaty, and our two countries will be performing for the first time ever this overture of nuclear disarmament. The performance has to be flawless.
The Soviet Union and the United States are acting as guarantors of the Afghan political settlement. This, too, is a precedent of tremendous importance. As guarantors, our two countries face a very responsible period, and we hope they both will go through it in a befitting manner. The whole world is watching to see how we are going to act in this situation.
Our main task continues to be the working out of an agreement on 50-percent reductions in strategic offensive arms while observing the ABM treaty. In our talks today, you and I devoted a lot of attention, and with good cause, to discussing the entire range of these problems. Mr. President, we are expected to ensure that the Moscow summit open up new horizons in the Soviet-American dialog, in relations between the U.S.S.R. -and the U.S., for the benefit of our two nations and the entire world. This is worth any effort and any amount of good will.
To cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America, to their better mutual knowledge and mutual understanding. I wish good health and happiness to you, Mr. President, to Mrs. Nancy Reagan, and to all our distinguished guests.
The President. Mr. General Secretary, I want to thank you again for the hospitality that we've encountered this evening and at every turn since our arrival in Moscow. We appreciate deeply the personal effort that you, Mrs. Gorbachev, and all of your associates have expended on our behalf.
Today has been a busy day. I want to thank you for the opportunity to meet with so many divergent members of Soviet society. As you know, I traveled to Danilov and met there with the clergy at that ancient monastery, and later in the day had most interesting exchanges with other members of Soviet society at Spaso House. These meetings only confirmed, Mr. General Secretary, the feelings of admiration and warmth that Americans harbor toward the peoples of the Soviet Union. As wartime allies, we came to know you in a special way. But in a broader sense, the American people, like the rest of the world, admire the saga of the peoples of the Soviet Union. The clearing of the forest, the struggle to build a society, the evolution into a modern state, and the struggle against Hitler's armies. There are other ways, too, that we know you: ""Happy or sad, my beloved, you are beautiful,"" says one of your folk songs, ""as beautiful as a Russian song, as beautiful as a Russian soul.""
As expressed in the great music, architecture, art—we need only look about us this evening—and literature that over many centuries you've given the world, we have beheld the beauty and majesty of your peoples' national experience. And without belittling the serious business before us, all of the fundamental issues that separate our governments, I hope you'll permit me tonight to say that in the eyes of the American people, your people truly are, as the folk song suggests, a people of heart and mind, a people—to use our vernacular-with soul. And that's why we believe there's common ground between our two peoples and why it is our duty to find common ground for our two governments.
Over the next 3 days, General Secretary Gorbachev and I will review what has been accomplished over the past 3 years and what our two nations might accomplish together in the months to come. We have a great deal to discuss on both accounts. What we have achieved is a good beginning. We have taken the first step toward deep reductions of our nuclear arsenals. We have taken the first step toward dealing with the reality that much of the tension and mistrust between our two countries arises from very different concepts of the fundamental rights and role of the individual in society. We have taken the first step to build that network of personal relationships and understanding between societies, between people, that are crucial to dispelling dangerous misconceptions and stereotypes.
These are good first steps, Mr. General Secretary, and we can both take pride in them, but as I said, they are just a start. Nuclear arsenals remain too large. The fighting continues needlessly, tragically, in too many regions of the globe. The vision of freedom and cooperation enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act remains unrealized. The American and Soviet peoples are getting to know each other better, but not well enough. Mr. General Secretary, you and I are meeting now for the fourth time in 3 years—a good deal more often than our predecessors. And this has allowed our relationship to differ from theirs in more than a quantitative state or sense.
We have established the kind of working relationship I think we both had in mind when we first met in Geneva. We've been candid about our differences, but sincere in sharing a common objective and working hard together to draw closer to it. It's easy to disagree and much harder to find areas where we can agree. We and our two governments have both gotten into the habit of looking for those areas. We found more than we expected. I intend to pursue the search for common ground during the months left to me as President. When I pass the job on to my successor, I intend to tell him it is a search that must be continued. Based on the achievements of the last few years, I will also tell him it is a search that can succeed.
Once again, Mr. General Secretary, I want to extend my thanks for your hospitality. I also hope you'll permit me to mention that, as you have been a gracious host, we've tried to be gracious guests by bringing along some small expressions of our gratitude. There's one gift in particular that I wanted to mention not only in view of my own former profession but because it has, I think, something important to say to us about what is underway this week in Moscow. It is a film, not as well-known as some but an American classic. It is a powerfully acted and directed story of family and romantic love, of devotion to the land and dedication to higher principle. It is also fun, it has humor. There's a renegade goose, a mischievous young boy, a noisy neighbor, a love-struck teenager in love with a gallant soldier, an adolescent struggling for manhood, a loving, highly principled wife, and a gentle but strong father. It's about the good and sometimes difficult things that happen between man and wife, and parent and child. The film also has sweep and majesty and power and pathos. For you see, it takes place against the backdrop of our American epic, the Civil War. And because the family is of the Quaker religion and renounces violence, each of its characters must, in his or her own way, face this war and the moral dilemma it poses. The film shows not just the tragedy of war, but the problems of pacifism, the nobility of patriotism, as well as the love of peace.
I promise not to spoil its outcome for you, but I hope you'll permit me to describe one scene. Just as the invading armies come into southern Indiana, one of our States, the Quaker farmer is approached by two of his neighbors. One is also a Quaker who earlier in the story, when times are peaceful, denounces violence and vows never to lift his hand in anger. But now that the enemy has burned his barn, he's on his way to battle and criticizes his fellow Quaker for not joining him in renouncing his religious beliefs. The other visitor, also on his way to battle, is the intruding but friendly neighbor. Yet it is this neighbor, although a nonbeliever, who says he's proud of the Quaker farmer's decision not to fight. In the face of the tragedy of war, he's grateful, as he says, that somebody's holding out for a better way of settling things.
It seems to me, Mr. General Secretary, that in pursuing these summit meetings we, too, have been holding out for a better way of settling things. And by the way, the film's title is more than a little appropriate. It's called ""Friendly Persuasion."" So, Mr. General Secretary, allow me to raise a glass to the work that has been done, to the work that remains to be done, and let us also toast the art of friendly persuasion, the hope of peace with freedom, the hope of holding out for a better way of settling things. Thank you, and God bless you.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"June 20, 1980","
PRESIDENT PERTINI. Mr. President, I am particularly happy to welcome you, Mrs. Carter, and your entourage on your first visit to Italy, which falls at a particularly delicate and difficult moment in international affairs and on the eve of the Venice summit. Public opinion in our countries look to this opportunity for obtaining an unambiguous and reassuring answer to the problems and uncertainties which lie before us.
Although at many similar occasions and meetings in the past, we have sought to emphasize how numerous and how close are the traditional ties which unite our two peoples and nations, permit me, Mr. President, to once again recall our substantial convergence of views.
The ties of friendship between Italy and the United States are deep-rooted and immutable and extend back through history to one of my fellow countrymen who opened up the frontier with the New World. This long history tells of the irresistible passage of men and ideas across the vastness of the ocean.
I am thinking now of the influence that the American Revolution had on movements for Italian unification and independence, the political and cultural interaction between Italy and the United States in the first half of the nineteenth century, which witnessed the first mass emigration of Italian labor to the United States, particularly from the most depressed areas of the Italian South. From that emigration a whole group of your countrymen originated, those of Italian extraction who made their mark through their hard work, tenacity, patience, and, affection, both for their country of adoption and their distant motherland in the Old World.
Nor can we Italians forget that at the darkest hour in our national history—and not ours alone—there came from the United States the decisive intervention against fascism and nazism, the moral support and the economic aid which permitted our ravaged and exhausted country to rebuild and regain its place within the international community.
Casting my mind back to our struggle, I am bound to recall that noble message which Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered to the U.S. Congress in the wartime winter of 1944. His conception of liberty was the same for which we were fighting, we Italian patriots in the mountains, towns, and cities, and it was for this same liberty that the European resistance and the Allies fought. It was a total political and social conception of liberty which remains today the fundamental value for which, Mr. President, we and our two countries are still fighting today.
I want now to take two quotations from that Roosevelt speech on which we all should meditate:
""This Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rights—among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and liberty.""
This great President then finalized this idea with these words:
""We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. Necessitous men are not free men. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made. In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all—regardless of station, race or creed.""
This conception of liberty, Mr. President, should be championed and consistently safeguarded in the international order also, in relations between all peoples, with the developing countries and with the Third World, which has so great a need for help from the industrialized nations to resolve the frequently life-and-death alternatives which encroach on all sides.
While I speak, millions of human beings are fighting against hunger. In 1979, 18 million children in the world died of malnutrition. This slaughter of the innocents is a condemnation which weighs heavily on the consciences of every statesman-and I am no exception. To resolve these agonizing problems means to strengthen that liberty proclaimed in the noble words of President Roosevelt.
To defend this liberty intact and indivisible, the United States have twice set foot on the old continent; these two memorable landings I myself lived through during the First and Second World Wars. And the gravestones recalling those American soldiers who laid down their lives that Europe might be free remain an everlasting monument to the defense of liberty.
These men indeed died for Europe's freedom, since the United States were not drawn to Europe by desire for conquest, but only by the firm resolution to stem the rising tide of authoritarian regimes. These men—I repeat—came to defend our liberty.
Mr. President, Italy is committed to a policy of dialog and detente in its awareness of the need for contacts which foster an understanding of the stances adopted by others and make its own position understood; this in the conviction that detente is the only possible way forward if a dangerous and complex spiral is to be avoided in international relations. Only an overall climate able to contribute to the maintenance of relations of friendship and confidence can effectively place relations between states in a framework within which elements of opposition and controversy can be settled and their causes progressively reduced.
This is the spirit which inspires our participation in the Atlantic Alliance, just as this is also the spirit which guides our staunch commitment to the creation of a politically unified Europe. Both these undertakings seem the surest means of removing the threats to peace, reducing tension, and achieving all those essential conditions for the peaceful and harmonious development of our peoples.
It is nevertheless necessary, particularly at a time when the future is so overshadowed with uncertainties, to succeed in expressing that Western solidarity to which we refer. This solidarity must therefore be translated into concerted and united positions on the major problems which confront us. If indeed a lesson can be learned from the analysis of the present political situation and outlook, it is surely the need—or urgency, rather—to strengthen ties, to create new forms of consultation and cooperation, in common recognition of the commitment which makes all of us equally indispensable to collective security.
It is for these reasons that we feel profound solidarity and sympathy with the feelings of the people of the United States and for the stand taken by the U.S. Government over the distressing issue of the Tehran hostages. I personally understand, Mr. President, the agony of your thoughts: to be forced to adopt embittered caution to avoid a global conflict. I have often asked myself what would have happened if the hostages had been of some other nationality. I am proud to have been the first to express full solidarity with you and to dispatch a firm protest to the Tehran authorities.
Our support of a friendly nation and ally is at this time inspired above all by concern for what is needed to restore as quickly as possible a situation of legality which has been so brutally overthrown. These events risk involving that overall climate of international relations in the overthrowal of rules which traditionally govern relations between states, when it is that climate which is the cornerstone of the very existence of states founded on the rule of law.
For these same reasons, Italy is opposed to any departure from the principle of constantly striving to safeguard detente. In particular, Italy deplores that most serious departure currently perpetrated in Afghanistan. This indeed jeopardizes not only local equilibria but also the general principles governing coexistence between peoples.
Yet again, therefore, we voice our firm protest against the brutal invasion of that country. With our own memories of the struggle against foreign powers who occupied and oppressed our country, we send out from this place, which is today honored by your presence, Mr. President, a message of brotherly solidarity to the Afghan patriots who are heroically pursuing their struggle against the invader. It would be cowardice to resign ourselves to the criminal act which has been committed, and cowardice is the main enemy not only of peace but also of democracy.
The task of defending peace and democracy in the world must be a common task. Europe must take its own responsibility for this onerous task if it is to survive; this responsibility can validly be undertaken by Europe to the degree to which the continent can succeed in achieving its unity. But this unity will never be obtained unless we learn to put aside our egotism and individual interests and permit the admission of nations such as Spain and Portugal to the European Community.
I still vividly recall my recent visit to Spain. This nation, which has without bloodshed made the transition from a long dictatorship to democracy, is today totally committed to its social and economic rebirth under the guidance of a young and wise sovereign.
A truly united Europe will never come into being while we continue to create restricted ""executive boards,"" or worse, even more limited bodies. The nations of democratic Europe—all nations, without discriminations of any sort—must take their place with equal rights and equal obligations. Italy has shown that she can fulfill her obligation, but she intends to see her rights and, above all, her national dignity, properly safeguarded.
You are familiar, Mr. President, with discriminations which have been practiced or attempted towards Italy. The United States has supported us, and for this, Mr. President, we are grateful. Yet permit me, nevertheless, as a representative of Italy—this country to which I have dedicated my whole life—to lodge my protest.
These discriminations are senseless, because they do not take into consideration the strategic importance derived from the nation's geographical position. Italy is a democratic bridge uniting Europe with Africa and the Middle East, and in the alarming event that this bridge should be destroyed, not only would the Mediterranean area be destabilized but world peace itself placed in jeopardy. Moreover, the terrorism in our country is probably aimed at just this objective.
With equal rights and equal obligations for each member and without these absurd discriminations, European unity can be truly created. Then, and only then, Europe, which has been a battlefield for centuries, can become through its human, cultural, technological, and industrial potential, a land of solidarity. A Europe on these lines could truly contribute to the strengthening and defense of world peace.
With these intentions and these remarks, I propose this toast to ever closer ties between Italy and the United States, to your own personal well-being and that of Mrs. Carter and all those present.
PRESIDENT CARTER. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
It's a great honor for me to be here on a trip of great economic importance to our Nation and also one of political and diplomatic significance to our two nations and also to the world.
My entire family has been here before me, and I have to admit that the best diplomat is not the one speaking to you. I remember when my mother arrived in Italy without any instructions from the diplomatic corps, she made three statements: First of all, she said she had always through her entire life wanted to meet the Pope; secondly, she congratulated Italy on choosing such a young President; and third she says, ""I have never met an ugly Italian man."" [Laughter]
I learn a lot from these visits. One piece of advice that I've gotten from the President is that when I go to Spain, I not go to bed too early, but be sure to see the flamenco dancers, and I intend to take your advice, Mr. President.
You have a text before you, but I would like to say these words to you, because they are so important to us. We have a lot in common. In each of our lands, a democracy has been born. Each has struggled to achieve the balance of unity and liberty that lead free societies to the highest form of human government—self-government.
Freedom and human rights have no firmer friend in thought and action than President Pertini. For personal liberty and democracy in this country, his country, he paid the price through years of cruel imprisonment. In fact, I understand that in 1940 he was not released from prison as he legally had a right to be, because he was considered especially dangerous. And so he remains today: dangerous to anyone who would threaten to destroy or to diminish the liberty of an individual, the rights of a group, or the life or livelihood of free people.
As chief of state, he was foremost in his appeal to Iranian authorities—the first of all—to release our diplomatic personnel from terrorists, and it gives me great pleasure on this personal occasion to express the gratitude which the American people and I feel for his unswerving support.
This morning, President Pertini and I discussed some of the central issues that are troubling world peace. Later I was able to discuss these questions with Prime Minister Cossiga, whose visit to Washington in January and whose presidency of the European Community have so deeply impressed us all.
Three basic ideas ran through our discussions today. The first is that the best possible policy for our countries, as we face a time of danger, change, and testing in the 1980's, is a policy that seeks both strong defense of national security and lasting world peace, for the plain truth is that the one is necessary to the other.
In decades past the West successfully resisted Soviet expansionism, both eastward and westward. Today we see the Soviet Union thrusting southward directly into Afghanistan and indirectly through Vietnam and Cambodia. This represents a strategic challenge to the vital interests of the West and to the industrial democracies. We must face it together. If we are firm in our resolve, we will define a position from which we can encourage detente. If we fail, we will have allowed the strategic, political, and economic balance to be gravely altered in favor of totalitarianism.
A second belief we share is that we cannot defend our common heritage of freedom by arms alone. Our future—the future of our way of life—is equally dependent upon our ability to provide economic opportunity and social justice for all our citizens and to create a decent world environment in which freedom can survive and prosper. We must be careful thinkers and practical politicians in our approach to energy independence, inflation, developing nations, arms control, and peace in troubled regions, such as the Middle East.
The third basic idea that ran through our discussions today is that national security and world peace can only be achieved by maintaining a strong and united Atlantic Alliance. Just as the best form of government is self-government, so the strongest cement of any alliance is free will. Ours is an alliance of independent democracies. We draw strength both from our common traditions and our individual differences.
Mr. President, let us not be afraid to confront directly and in full public view the most fundamental challenges of our alliance today. We've heard a great deal recently about the differences and the disagreements among the Western democracies. Some voices in my country and in Europe talk about disarray. Some pessimists view debate among democratic nations as a signal of fatal weakness. They predict the decline of Western civilization, spreading pessimism, materialism, softness of will, and diminishing confidence in ourselves and in our institutions.
Our experience and reality itself shows clearly that these self-styled realists are wrong. Our open and public grappling with economic and social problems cannot obscure the extraordinary achievements of our society as a whole. The democratic nations are magnets for young students from all over the world. The democratic world is a center of intellectual and technological invention. It's a great focus of cultural creativity. It's undergoing a major resurgence of religious belief, and our political institutions establish and exhibit a resilience unmatched by any society in the totalitarian world.
It is not from democracy that millions of refugees have fled since 1945. It is not to escape democracy that people have risked their lives in small boats in the high seas during recent weeks. It is not from democracy that nearly 10 percent of the people of an entire Asian nation have left their ancient homeland. And it is certainly not from democracy, but from foreign oppression, that hundreds of thousands—almost a million—of men, women, and children have now fled Afghanistan. These votes of fleeting millions are being cast—as the voices of millions more are being raised—for the deeply rooted faith that gives democracy its unique dynamism: Our underlying belief in the inalienable rights and dignity of human beings.
Material accomplishments and cultural vitality alone cannot express the power of our spiritual heritage. Nor is the spirit of our society found simply in the enterprise, the skills, or success of our people. The fundamental desire for democracy rises from the very center of the human heart and the human soul. That's why the echo of the unsilenceable call for liberty is heard throughout the world. That call finds its voice in the nations assembling in Venice tomorrow.
Our faith in human rights—the freedom, the dignity, and the value of every individual—is the most compelling revolutionary concept of our times. It has produced a level of economic progress and intellectual creativity unmatched by any other political philosophy or idea. We have no reason to fear change, new ideas, or new problems. We do not rely on military invasions by so-called friendly neighbors, much less on terrorism, to sustain the idea of liberty. It stands on its own merit.
The search for freedom and democracy has spread throughout recent years—in Spain, in Portugal, in Greece, in Africa, in Latin America. Today the genuine human voice of democracy rings far more clearly than the rasping loudspeakers of authoritarian regimes.
But while liberty need not be imposed by force, we know all too well that once won, it must be defended. To quote from your statement, Mr. President, ""Cowardice is the main enemy not only of peace but also of democracy."" The search for peace demands strength, not weakness; firmness, not vacillation; pride, not arrogance. We do not seek to remake the world on the model of America or the West. We want the peoples of the world to decide their own destroy and to make their own choices. We are confident, because history is on the side of freedom.
Let there be no mistake about this: The West is not motivated by relentless hostility nor by a desire for indiscriminate confrontation nor a return to the cold war.
But for the Western alliance simply to accept foreign occupation and domination of Afghanistan as an accomplished fact would be a cynical signal to the world that could only encourage further aggression, further tension, and further danger to world peace. It is our responsibility to register in concrete terms our condemnation of the Soviet invasion for as long as that invasion continues.
We cannot know with certainty the motivations of the latest Soviet move, whether Afghanistan is the purpose or the prelude, but there can be no doubt that this invasion poses an increased threat to the independence of nations in the region and to the world's access to vital resources and to vital sealanes. The fact is that our democracies are dependent on oil supplies from a volatile region whose own security from internal divisions and from external threat is now in question. Unresolved, that security problem could change the way we live. Already it does touch directly or drastically the lives of all.
But our interest in peace and stability in the region goes far beyond economics. In this ever more interdependent world, to assume that aggression need be met only when it occurs at one's own doorstep is to tempt new and very serious adventures.
Detente with the Soviets remains our goal, but detente must be built on a firm foundation of deterring aggression. The Soviets must understand that they cannot recklessly threaten world peace or still enjoy the benefits of cooperation while pursuing a policy of armed intervention. Above all, everyone must know that efforts cannot succeed to divide our alliance nor to lull us into a false belief that somehow America or Europe can be an island of detente while aggression is carried out elsewhere.
We recognize, Mr. President, that our policy towards those who might threaten peace must be clear, it must be consistent, it must be comprehensible. There must be no room for any miscalculation. But let me be equally clear that the way to improved relations is open, and that is the path we prefer.
I'm confident that just as the American people want to sustain strong policies against Soviet aggression, they also want our strong efforts to continue at arms control. We know that the SALT II agreement can contribute directly to the security not only of the United States but of Europe and indeed of the entire world. It can help to restrain future arms competition, continue the historically important direction of nuclear arms limitation, and keep our faith that even the most dangerous differences can be resolved in a framework of cooperation. Especially now in this time of tension, observing the mutual constraints imposed by the treaty is in the best interest of every nation on Earth.
Therefore, I intend to honor the object and purpose of the treaty as long as the Soviet Union, as observed by us, does the same. I will remain in close consultation with our Congress with the goal of seeking the ratification of SALT II at the earliest opportune time.
Further, if the decade of the 1980's is not to become the decade of violence, we must work with our friends on renewed efforts to stabilize all aspects of arms competition and to widen the scope of arms control agreements.
In sum, I do not accept forecasts of weakness or failure for democracy in the world. Our societies, our values, our freedoms will decline only if we allow them to do so; only if we surrender to uncertainty about where we stand and in what we believe; only if we forget that each nation and each individual share a responsibility to pull together and defend those common beliefs which unite us—and I am convinced that none of us will ever surrender nor forget.
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, just as within each democracy we must work to nourish the spirit of community which alone can make the whole of a nation larger than the sum of its parts, so within the alliance of free nations it is equally true that unless we work together we shall surely be vulnerable separately.
I pledge America's own unswerving commitment to our common interest of security and peace, and we depend on our European friends and allies to join us in that effort. Together we can and will defend the values and interests of our society. Historical experience counsels such a course. Present circumstances compels it.
It is in this spirit of alliance and partnership that I ask you to join me in a toast. If you would please rise. To President Pertini, to the traditions of two great nations that are at once parallel and interwined, and to the unbreakable spirit of freedom, friendship, and the love of human life that will forever join our countries and our people.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"March 28, 1978","
President and Mrs. Perez, distinguished friends from Venezuela and from my own country:
It is a great honor and a pleasure for us—my wife, my daughter, and I—to be here with you.
I speak a little better Spanish than I understand, and I may have gotten a few words of the President incorrectly, and I'm sure he'll correct me tomorrow morning if I make a mistake. But I would like to thank him for his offer to reduce the price of oil 5 percent each year for the next 5 years and to lend the United States enough to balance our budget next year. Thank you very much, Mr. President. [Laughter]
I cannot hope to match the richness and the profound remarks of President Perez. I will try to respond more fully to economic matters in my speech tomorrow morning to the Congress of Venezuela. But tonight, I do want to offer a few comments of my own.
As I said, I'm delighted to be with friends in Venezuela, not only because of the path that our nations are walking together but also because of the rare, personal friendship that has developed between President Perez and me.
Since I took office, I've had an opportunity to meet with many foreign leaders—last year, more than 65. And in different ways, I have learned a lot about them all. But there are no others who have equaled the guidance and the vision of President Perez, nor with whom I have felt such kinship of purpose. It is no coincidence that this is the third opportunity which I have arranged for extensive consultations with him.
President Perez knows that I look upon him, in spite of his great youth, as a senior statesman. And he deserves this title in the finest sense of the term, for he has proven his statesmanship and also the maturity of his judgment.
The most satisfying aspect of our friendship is that it clearly reflects the compatibility between our governments and also between our people.
Venezuela proclaims its belief that the cause of human rights must and will prevail, and we agree. Venezuelans are working to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and so are we.
The leaders of your country believe that each nation of the world should be free to manage its own internal affairs, free from unwarranted outside intervention, and the same belief exists among the leaders of our people in the United States.
We both believe that people in every part of the world, under every economic system, should have democratic rights to participate in their own government and to shape their own destiny. We both know that nations with wealth to spare have an obligation to share it. And here, as in other areas, Venezuela has set an example for us to try to equal. We both are aware of the increasing sense of regional need and common purpose that exists among the nations of the Caribbean and of that nation's tremendous potential for future growth and harmony.
Venezuela and the United States are both attempting to restrict the excessive trade in weapons and to reduce the arsenals which already exist, and we will redouble our common efforts in the near future to realize this hope.
We both believe that nations must cooperate in the world's energy problems through conservation, better distribution, research and development, and exploration of new energy sources. We both believe that direct consultations and negotiations among nations can resolve even major differences and are the surest path to peace.
We both have learned through happy experience that exchanges among our people, especially students, can build permanent bonds of understanding between us.
Venezuela again has shown how these bonds are built with the Ayacucho Foundation, which permits students from each country to study in the other. Because of this visit and others on my journey, and in memory of your friend, our great American statesman, Hubert Humphrey, I would like to announce tonight my intention to establish a program of Humphrey scholarships which will bring poor but outstanding students from Latin America and throughout the world to study in the colleges of the United States.
In this spirit of harmony and obvious cooperation, in the warmth of personal friendship which I feel around us tonight, I offer a toast to the leader and to the nation with whom we share so much and from whom we learn so much.
To President Perez and to the people of the great nation of Venezuela.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"March 25, 1982","
President Pertini and distinguished guests:
While looking over President Pertini's schedule, I noted that, consistent with his interest in the arts, he'll be attending the theater while in San Francisco. Now, Mr. President, if I could be so bold as to make a personal suggestion: In a few years when your term of office is coming to a close, you might consider making the theater a second career. [Laughter] For an energetic man like yourself, there are interesting opportunities. I know that it works one way, and it might work in reverse. [Laughter]
But seriously, all of us wish you a wonderful tour on this, your first visit to our country. We only regret that we've had to wait so long to be your host.
Tonight we honor a man who, had he never become President of his country, would still inspire awe from those who meet him. The overwhelming respect of his countrymen has resulted in his election by an unprecedented margin—839 out of 995 votes east in the electoral assembly. This tribute was due to the recognition by all Italians of his courage and integrity, and he hasn't let his people down.
President Pertini has been second to none in upholding those principles of political freedom which bind all who love liberty. Shortly after his election, he said, ""If someone offered me, who has always been a socialist, the most radical social reform at the expense of freedom, I would refuse, because freedom must never be bartered away."" Such commitment to freedom found in decent people of both left and right offers us all hope for a better tomorrow.
All of his life, President Pertini has tried to remain true to these ideals. As a young man, he fought the onslaught of fascism then threatening humanity. He was imprisoned for his opposition to Mussolini and later was sentenced to death by the Nazis. This kind of brutal experience turned many in those days away from democracy and toward totalitarianism. President Pertini never wavered from his democratic ideals.
As it was for many nations, the last decade was a trying time for Italy. Italy faced a sinister challenge that shook its system to the roots. Like Fascists and Nazis, Red Terrorists sought to undermine faith in democracy by demoralizing the people. The Italian people needed a symbol of strength and a symbol of courage and they found that symbol in President Pertini.
One of his first actions was to protest the trials of Soviet dissidents in Moscow. Few Western leaders have expressed such sincere moral outrage over Soviet oppression in Afghanistan and Poland. Perhaps tonight we should realize that the solidarity that unites all those devoted to freedom far transcends the limited differences between the democratic right and the democratic left.
President Pertini, we're in a unique position to prove to the world that freedom works, that people with different domestic policies can work together if liberty is threatened.
I've enjoyed the meetings today, and I thank you for honoring us with this visit. Now, may I ask all of you to join me in a toast to President Pertini and to the Italian people.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"October 04, 1994","
President Mandela, members of the South African delegation, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans. Mr. President, the American people welcome you to the White House on this, the occasion of your first state visit to the United States. You've been an inspiration to the American people. You have been a genuine inspiration to the American people and to freedomloving people around the world, people who still marvel at the price you paid for your conviction, a conviction that our country embraces but still struggles to live up to, the conviction that all men and women are created equal and therefore ought to have a chance to live up to the fullest of their God-given potential and to have an equal say in the affairs of their land.
Your captivity symbolized the larger captivity of your nation, shackled to the chains of prejudice, bigotry, and hatred. And your release also freed your nation and all its people to reach their full potential, a quest too long and so cruelly denied.
But your story, thankfully, for all South Africans and for the rest of us as well, does not end with your freedom; it continues into what you have sought to do with your freedom. Because you've found within you the strength to reconcile, to unite, to make whole a country too long divided, you are giving real life to the magnificent words that begin the Freedom Charter you helped to draft nearly 40 years ago: ""South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white.""
Now, instead of focusing on the past 342 years, when South Africa did not belong to all who lived in it, you are building a future of trust and tolerance. White South Africans might have fled in fear of retribution, but instead, they have had the courage to stay and to join you in building a new future for all the people of your land. I would say to a world too often torn apart by racial and ethnic and religious strife: Watch South Africa as it comes together, and follow South Africa's example.
As an American, and as a child of the southern part of our country who grew up in a segregated environment and saw firsthand its horror and its debasement of all of us who lived in it, I must add that, as you well know, Mr. President, your presence here has special significance for Americans. We have been especially drawn to the problems and the promise of South Africa. We have struggled, and continue to struggle, with our own racial challenges. So we rejoice, especially, in what you have accomplished, and we hold it out. And as we hold it out as an example to others, so we also hold it out as an example to ourselves.
Mr. President, I know how proud you are to have your daughter, Zinzi, with you on this trip, and I am proud to have her as my dinner partner tonight. I know that during your years in captivity you were a prodigious letter writer and your daughter was one of your favorite correspondents, not least because of her own writing talent. In one letter, written from your cell at Robben Island Prison, you counseled her as follows: ""While you have every reason to be angry with the fates for the setbacks you may have suffered from time to time, you must vow""—excuse me. Let me read it again; it's so beautiful, it shouldn't be marred by my voice. ""While you have every reason to be angry with the fates for the setbacks you may have suffered from time to time, you must vow to turn those misfortunes into victory. There are few misfortunes in this world you cannot turn into personal triumph if you have the iron will and the necessary skill.""
President Mandela, you have shown us the iron will and the necessary skill. And I might add, you have done it with genuine compassion for others. We are honored by your presence here. We are honored by the promise that your leadership offers your country. We are committed to your success and proud of the partnership we have already established.
And so I ask all my fellow Americans to raise their glasses to you and to all those who have led South Africa into the bright light of freedom.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"November 08, 2010","
Madam President, thank you for your very gracious words and for the example of your leadership that inspires so many women, as well as men, across this nation. I was observing that one of the reasons I think India is doing so well is because it has so many strong women leaders. And I want to thank you and Dr. Shekhawat for hosting us this evening and your extraordinary hospitality.
To our dear friends, Prime Minister Singh and Mrs. Kaur; to distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen: On behalf of Michelle and I, we just want to thank you for this extraordinary expression of friendship between our two nations.
I've done a lot of speaking today, so I want to be relatively brief. We've learned several things from this trip in India. We've learned that despite geographic distances between our nations, we are now closer than ever before. We've learned that although we may have traveled different paths to reach this moment in history, that we can walk towards the future together. We've also learned that no matter how hard I try, Michelle will always be a better dancer. [Laughter]
Let me say, it's been a particular pleasure to be here during Diwali. And last year during the state visit when Prime Minister Singh and Mrs. Kaur came, it was during our Thanksgiving season. And the fact that we can share some of our most meaningful holidays with each other speaks to the closeness of our countries and the values that we share as well as the common hopes for the future.
To my good friend and partner, Prime Minister Singh, from humble beginnings to high office, your life reflects all the progress and possibility of this great nation. And so all of us thank you not only for leading this nation and our partnership to new heights, but for the spirit with which you've led your life, with compassion, truth, commitment, humility, and love.
And to all who are gathered here tonight and to the people of India, for the past 3 days you've opened your country to us. Like so many before, we learned that you don't simply visit India, you experience India, in the richness of its traditions, in its diversity, the optimism and the warmth of its people.
From extraordinarily difficult circumstances, India has achieved what many thought was impossible. And in doing so, you captured the imagination of the world. Now our two nations have a chance to do what many also thought was impossible, and that is to build a global partnership in a new century.
And so I'd like to close with the words that your President spoke in this building on the day that India declared itself a republic, words describing how this diverse nation has stayed united and strong and because they speak to the spirit that binds our two countries together as well.
I propose a toast, knowing that our ties subsist because they are not of iron or steel or even of gold, but of the silken cords of the human spirit. Cheers.

state-dinners,George Bush,"July 30, 1991","
President Bush. May I first thank you, Mr. President and Mrs. Gorbachev, and all the Soviet people who have welcomed Barbara and me so warmly to this great city and this great country in this historic time.
And I want to pay a special tribute to our host and friend -- a man that my country greatly admires, and a man that I greatly admire. When he came to Washington last year, I took him up to Camp David, and while there, we played a game called horseshoes -- a game in which you throw a horseshoe as close as possible to a stake far away. And on his very first try, he hit the stake. And I gave him that horseshoe as a symbol of good luck. But, as with everything he's accomplished, I think his success was due more to his unique mixture of determination, courage, and skill.
Dramatic changes have reshaped our world since we first met 6 years ago, Mr. President. The relationship between our great nations has moved from confrontation to friendship. Our growing ties remind me of an old proverb from your land: There's no road too long and no obstacle too hard for friendship. Our nations friendship, built on mutual respect and personal trust, is changing the world.
For almost a decade, the START negotiators sought to achieve real and stabilizing reductions in our strategic arsenals. And tomorrow, we will sign a START agreement -- a treaty that bolsters the promise of peace and advances the security of both of our nations -- the first agreement ever to reduce the number of strategic nuclear arms. START and CFE both testify to our new spirit of cooperation and to its potential for building world peace.
But arms control is only one element of our new relationship. We will spend much of our 2 days together discussing the issues that will shape our future: democracy, free markets, prosperity, and peace.
A peaceful revolution has unfolded in the Soviet Union, and we wholeheartedly support your progress towards a society based upon the rule of law, democratic institutions, and a system of free enterprise.
We stand ready to work with you in transforming your economic system by normalizing bilateral ties, deepening our trade relations, and taking concrete steps to support market reforms in many sectors -- food and energy and defense conversion.
Today, we spoke of ways to follow up on President Gorbachev's successful visit to London. The United States supports your integration into the global economy, but a successful integration will ultimately depend on your democratic and market reforms.
Internationally, our growing partnership as peacemakers and peacekeepers continues to deepen. In the past year, we've worked together to deter aggression and to encourage nations to resolve their differences peacefully.
And now, our common efforts may help bring peace to the Middle East. In this region where dangerous confrontations once divided our nations, we may consolidate our partnership as peacemakers.
Our people will face tough challenges in the days ahead. And I understand that it's an ancient custom in your land that when you prepare for a long journey, you sit for a moment of quiet reflection. Perhaps that is what we need to do now, at least in the silence of our hearts. Individually and together, you see, we face a long, exciting journey of change.
We can gain strength from the words of Chekhov, who once wrote of our responsibility to our world: Man has been endowed with reason, with the power to create, so that he can add to what he has been given.
And let us add then, to the relationship we have developed in recent years. And let us build a better future. And as we begin, may I echo your traditional toast: To the future of our countries. And may I add, the health and happiness of President and Mrs. Gorbachev.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"November 18, 2012","
Prime Minister Yinglak. President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great pleasure to welcome you to Thailand and to be the first country to receive you after your decisive reelection victory. I hope to make the gala dinner tonight not only a reception for your visit, but also a celebration for your second term in office. I sincerely believe that your Presidency will be a successful one and will be fruitful in enhancing the relationship between our two nations.
I also wish to take this occasion to thank you, you and your team, in particular Secretary Clinton, for all that she has done to advance Thai-U.S. relations and U.S. engagement with Asia. Our partnership is exceptional, not only because of the deep historical roots, but also because of strong people-to-people ties based on shared values of democracy and respect for civil liberties.
We appreciate your support in bringing democracy in Thailand back on track. I hope you continue to do so as Thailand's democracy still faces many challenges ahead.
In terms of economic relations, as the President and I have discussed today, we will continue to build on a strong foundations in expanding our trade and investment to promote growth and create jobs. The world is changing fast, and only through trust, partnership, can we ensure peace and prosperity for both nations.
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, for me there is no better way to launch a celebration of our 180th anniversary of relations in 2013 than with this Presidential visit today. May I invite all of you to join me in toast: To the good health and success of President Barack Obama and to the long-lasting friendship between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Thailand.
Cheers.
[At this point, Prime Minister Yinglak offered a toast.]
President Obama. Well, good evening, everyone. Madam Prime Minister, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, my visit to Thailand is far too brief, but even in my short stay, I've already felt the extraordinary warmth and kindness and hospitality of the people of Thailand. Everyone knows that this is the Land of Smiles, and I have felt it everywhere that I've gone.
I've also felt the dignity and strength of this country and its people: the tranquility and peace that I felt as I had the privilege of walking around the sacred grounds of Wat Pho and gazing up at the Reclining Buddha; the compassion and wisdom that you felt in the presence of His Majesty the King, who has devoted his reign to the welfare and development of his people. We've seen it in the resilience that has pushed this Nation forward, most recently, in the face of devastating floods.
And most of all, I think we all feel here tonight the unique friendship between our peoples. His Majesty once said that since he was born in America, the United States is ""half my motherland."" And we are just as proud of all the Thai Americans who enrich our country. In fact, I was mentioning to His Majesty that my friend, Ladda Tammy Duckworth, just became the first Thai American woman ever to be elected to our Congress, and she's from my home State of Illinois, so I'm especially proud of her.
Everything that I've felt—your dignity, your resilience, your friendship, your warmth—that is the foundation of our alliance. It's why you were the first Asian nation to reach out to America after we won our Independence. It's why in Asia, to this day, we can say Thailand is our oldest friend. And we are extraordinarily proud of that friendship, and we are especially pleased to see the excellent leadership that, Madam Prime Minister, you are providing as you continue this country's path of democracy, freedom, and development.
So I want to propose a toast: To the friendship between our peoples, to the strength of our alliance, to the peace and prosperity that we seek, and to Their Majesties the King and the Queen.
Chai yo!
[President Obama offered a toast.]

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"January 24, 1980","
THE PRESIDENT. I know all of you join me in this happy occasion, happy because we have a very fine friend here from a great nation. It's a pleasure for me to welcome Prime Minister Cossiga here.
This is his first official visit to the White House, and I know I join with all of you in hoping that he'll come back here several times, for many years in the future-and you and I will be here to greet him as hosts. [Laughter] So far, I have no arguments from our guest. [Laughter]
As a matter of fact, he and I have a lot in common. I went for a number of years, and to three different colleges, and finally got a bachelor of science degree; he's a distinguished professor of constitutional law. We've both served in the Federal Government, as you know. I've been in office 3 years; he's served 22 years. [Laughter] He has held many offices in the federal government of Italy; I've only held one office. [Laughter] We both have been in the Navy. He's still in the reserves. He's a commander, and I was a lieutenant. [Laughter] But we both have actually one thing in common: Sardinia is just about as far from Rome as Georgia is from Washington. [Laughter]
Our guest is a scholar and still a student. And one of the great historic figures whom he admires most is Sir Thomas More. He's written about Sir Thomas More, and he described him in these words: ""A great political leader. A fine diplomat. An eminent jurist, and a productive man of culture."" And I think that description accurately describes our guest here this evening.
I quoted this morning from a saying in Sardinia, that one only knows one's true friends in a time of crisis or tribulation, challenge. And in the last few months under Prime Minister Cossiga, we have been reminded in our own Nation again of the true value of friendship.
Our country has been tested; we have faced difficult and trying times. And I think the harmony that we have achieved, because of the sensitivity and the friendship and the tremendous political courage exhibited by the leader of the Government of Italy, has been an inspiration to all of us and a support that we will never forget.
There is a characteristic about our Nation which hasn't been adequately emphasized since American hostages were seized by militant kidnapers on the fourth day of November last year. It's a significant measure of the character of a nation when it shows how it responds to an act of terrorism that hurts one person or a few people. The entire Nation and in fact the entire world was aroused when President Moro was a victim of an act of terrorism. It showed not only the strength of Italy to come together in a sense of both unity and concern because a violent act was perpetrated against humanity, but America has exhibited the same kind of sentiment and the same kind of unity and the same kind of strength and the same kind of concern and the same kind of compassion in the last few weeks—220 million Americans absolutely obsessed with the fact that 50 of our fellow citizens were being held as innocent victims by terrorists. I think it's a measure not of weakness, but of strength, and I'm very grateful that we in this time of trial have had the absolute firm support of the people and the Government of Italy.
In addition to that, the Italian Government and its people have expressed in very strong terms their condemnation of the unwarranted military aggression against the people of Afghanistan.
It's not only in a time of crisis and trial and testing that we and the Italian people have been drawn together. We have much in common, as you well know, not only in times of current events but historical perspective. Our culture has been derived to a major degree from the great teachers, scholars, poets, of Rome. Every American knows at least one phrase in Latin, ""E Pluribus Unum,"" and it came, as you know, from a poet, Virgil, in Rome.
Obviously this is not the only thing that we derived from Italy. One of the things that we've noticed, that I have noticed today, is the rapid growth in the number of Italo-Americans who live in our Nation. This morning I said after talking to the Prime Minister—I got my figure from the Prime Minister—that there were 7 million Italo-Americans in this country. And this evening, just a few hours later, there are 20 million Italo-Americans. [Laughter] And my wife and Gino Paolucci 1 on the way in said, ""It's not 20 million, Mr. President; it's 30 million."" [Laughter] I am sure after this visit by the Prime Minister there will be at least 65 million Italo-Americans in our country. [Laughter]
Well, we do have strong and firm and constant military ties with Italy. We have strong and firm and constant and very valuable political ties with Italy. We also have economic ties, cultural ties. And I think perhaps the most important of all is the one I just mentioned, ties of blood, of kinship. There is no way under any possible political party or any possible President that our Nation could ever be separated from a feeling of affinity and mutual purpose for the people of Italy, because not only 20 or 30 million Italo-Americans live here but their influence and their concern remind all Americans of the value of this ancient friendship, the sharing of culture, the sharing of present problems, and the sharing of a great future destiny.
It's an honor for us to have a statesman and a scholar, a great diplomat and a firm political leader to come and be with us this evening. And I would like to propose a toast at this time to Prime Minister Cossiga and to the great and to the brave people of Italy.
Mr. Prime Minister, we're glad to have you with us.
THE PRIME MINISTER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Ladies and gentlemen, President Carter has just mentioned that he came out of the Navy as a mere lieutenant, while I'm a commander or captain; and then he came out with a bachelor's degree from college, and I am a professor; and I have served in many capacities in my country, and he has served only in one here. But there is one thing that he can do that I have noticed: His aides allow him to speak off the cuff, something that my aides do not. [Laughter]
Of course, guess what I am going to get from my aides for speaking off the cuff tonight? But they'll catch up with me in Rome.
President Carter has also mentioned that I am very deeply attached to Sir Thomas More, and he has said that many of the things that apply to him can apply to me. But I can say that it was said of Thomas More that he was born for friendship and progress, and, Mr. President, this applies to you.
Mr. President, I can rightfully number his day among the richest of my political and personal life—this day, which sees me extend to you the greetings of Italy and the Italian Government and people, and express to you the high esteem, profound respect, sincere friendship and gratitude for your cordial hospitality. This is all the more so since in you I feel I pay tribute and address the great American Nation: the nation of the Pilgrim Fathers, the nation of great struggles and sacrifices during the colonial period to win and to defend the guarantees of democracy, the nation of the great struggles for independence, and the nation which at the most crucial moments of world history has always been an important part of the struggle for liberty.
I feel I am addressing the country which first laid down democratic consensus as the basis for political power, the country which, at so many times in its life, has given expression to the style and solidity of ancient Rome, and not only through the use of the words ""E Pluribus Unum,"" the splendor of renaissance Italy, and the creative brilliance of baroque Italy.
I see that my speech is long; therefore, Mr. President, I'm going to face the wrath of my aides, and I am going to speak off the cuff. [Laughter] Otherwise I hope-[inaudible].
Mr. President, I hope I will be able to express, in a few simple words, what it said, in more flowery terms, in the text that we had prepared in Rome. This morning, Mr. President, you gave me a lesson of simplicity which I have learned. It's not the habit of Italian politicians to be very simple. [Laughter]
My visit here today comes as a proof of friendship and solidarity towards your great country at the time when the United States feel affected in their deepest feelings by the fate of the hostages which are being held at present in Iran, and to whom I wish, as a man and a Christian, a safe return home to their families and in their country.
I arrived here, Mr. President, at the time where the political situation of the world is in turmoil. I came as an Italian and as a European, a friend among friends, an ally among allies, and I have been treated as such since the moment I stepped on American soil.
We, in Italy, are committed to defend the security of our people, hence, of the whole world. And we are convinced that it is only through the respect of international law and through the respect of the sovereignty of nations that it will be possible to have peace reign.
The history of your country and of our country have many points in common, Mr. President. We both fought for our independence, our freedom, and our unity, and we both do not wish to lose it.
I have come from the old continent to the new continent, and I have found that the new continent has reached unity before we have. And yet, I assure you, we are working towards that goal in order to be worthy of the sons of Europe who have come to these shores. Together we work for peace in the conviction that only through this work for peace it will be possible to guarantee the security and liberty of the world. It is a duty that we share not only vis-a-vis of our perspective people, we share it vis-a-vis of the whole world. They are the fathers of liberty in the old continent, the fathers of liberty in the new continent. That is why we are friends and allies and brothers. And no matter what, we shall continue, Mr. President, together to work for peace, liberty, and security. Thank you.
And now, I have a request to make. Could you please sort of break a lance in my favor with my aides so that I don't get too much hate? [Laughter]
"
state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"April 20, 1995","
Mr. President, Mrs. Cardoso, members of the Brazilian delegation, to all of our distinguished guests, Hillary and I are delighted to welcome you to the White House this evening.
Mr. President, I learned many things about you today. But one thing sort of surprised me: I learned that as a young man you were drawn to a life of the cloth. The reason I learned that and found it surprising was my grandmother told me that I would make a good minister if I were just a little better boy—[laughter]— and failing that, that I should go into politics. [Laughter]
But I think for a long time your family and friends believed you were more likely to wear a Cardinal's red hat than a President's sash. Well, you embraced politics, and now you lead your great nation. But I can't help wondering whether after 4 months in office, after spending 2,880 hours dealing with Congress and fielding questions from the media, whether you ever wonder if you made the right choice. [Laughter]
Let me say from the point of view of the people of the United States, you clearly made the right choice. And it is obvious to all of us that your faith has remained a powerful part of your life. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain how you have endured arrest, blacklisting, and exile without giving in to despair; difficult to explain that although the enemies of democracy forced you to listen to your friends being tortured and later bombed the office where you worked, you never wavered from the ideals of tolerance and openness.
Those ideals animate your leadership in Brazil today and your quest for social justice for all the people whom you proudly represent. And you have added to them an academic's expertise in policy and economics, which I am pleased to note, you have refined by teaching at some of our finest universities. We have all been impressed by the results you have achieved, especially the success of your ""Real Plan.""
Mr. President, I have been very pleased for the opportunity to continue the personal conversation we began in Miami last year at the Summit of the Americas. The warm and productive relationship that we have established mirrors the relationship that is growing closer every day between our two countries. We have common interests, bringing free trade to the Americas, promoting sustainable development throughout our hemisphere, keeping peace around the world. And that relationship is more important than ever.
I know from our discussions that we both believe Brazil and the United States have an opportunity, indeed an obligation, to be partners for progress in the Americas for all the years ahead. Today we have taken that partnership to a new level.
Let me also say, Mr. President, you know that you have come here, along with your wife and your fine delegation, at a very difficult time for our country. And all the American people have been profoundly impressed and grateful by your expressions of condolence and sympathy and your assertion that we are all partners in the struggle against evil and inhumanity. For that we are especially grateful, and we will never forget it.
So I ask all of you to stand and raise your glasses in a toast to President and Mrs. Cardoso and to the people of Brazil.
"
state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"July 29, 1982","
The President. It's been a personal pleasure for me to welcome Prime Minister Gandhi back to this city and to this house today.
The Prime Minister and I and Secretary Shultz and other members of our government have had a long and meaningful discussion on a wide range of subjects. Often we came at these subjects from different perspectives born of different national experiences and roles in the world. But throughout I have been struck by the strength, the intelligence, and the determination of the Prime Minister, not only in explaining her views but in seeking a clear understanding of ours. The dialog of discovery that we began at Cancun matured in our discussions today and will, I trust, bear important fruit in the days and years ahead.
During our recent visit to Europe I had the honor of addressing a joint session of the British Parliament. It seemed fitting to build my speech around the concept of democracy which that ""Mother of Parliaments"" represents. We sought to articulate the deep and abiding faith of the American people placed in our democratic institutions and the idea that an immutable bond draws democratic countries together.
One of the nations I singled out was India. I chose India in that speech for two reasons. India's experience since independence exemplifies the gathering strength of the democratic revolution. And India stands in eloquent refutation of all those who argue that democratic institutions are not equal to the task of dealing with today's problems, or are irrelevant to the needs of today's developing nations. For these reasons, India serves as a beacon not only to developing nations which seek to emulate its experience but to all of us who seek renewal of our faith in democracy.
You can understand, Madam Prime Minister, why we are honored to have you here. It's not only because you're the leader of a great nation, one whose history, civilization, size, and influence on the world command our attention and respect, but also because you're the representative of a family which has been in so many ways the architect of that nation.
The contributions which your family has made to India most closely parallel in our history the Adams family. They came from Massachusetts, not Kashmir. They came—by coincidence they were often referred to as Boston Brahmins. [Laughter] And theirs, too, was a tradition of scholarship, sacrifice, and public service. Successive generations of Adamses contributed to our national development, first by struggling for independence and articulating our national ideals, then through years of selfless effort toward their attainment. So you, Madam Prime Minister, your father, and each of your sons have served India.
Lord Bolingbroke's description of the Adams family is equally appropriate for your family's contribution to India. ""They are the guardian angels of the country they inhabit, studious to avert the most distant evil and to procure peace, plenty, and the greatest of human blessings, liberty.""
The recent summit at Versailles proved once again, as I told the British Parliament, that even in times of severe economic strain, free peoples can work together freely and voluntarily to address problems as serious as inflation, unemployment, trade, and economic development in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity. In our bilateral relationship as well, democratic principles are the foundation on which we can build the framework of a lasting and durable friendship. The day-to-day reality of our close ties, whether in the fields of education, the arts, science, or commerce, all flow from the same basic understanding that although our countries may travel separate paths from time to time, our destination remains the same.
For my part, Madam Prime Minister, our talks today were particularly useful in reaffirming the inherent strength of our relationship. Our frank discussions have contributed greatly to the stripping away of stereotypes which have sometimes surrounded our relations. We look forward now to a renewal of cooperation based on the shared understanding of our common values and our common aspirations.
In this spirit, Madam Prime Minister, I raise my glass to you as the distinguished leader of a great sister democracy and to the friendship between our two proud, free peoples.
Thank you.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, distinguished guests:
Entering the White House, one cannot but think of the men of vision and energy and the women of character and grace who have lived here, who have influenced people's minds and the course of world events. Awesome indeed are the responsibilities of the United States and its President. In far-off India, at a time when communications were not as satisfactory, our own freedom struggle drew inspiration from the makers of your nation. How farseeing and wise they were, and how well they built.
The first President, who chose this site, had a simple wish, and I quote: ""I hope ever to see America amongst the foremost nations in examples of justice and liberality."" Since those words were uttered, the United States has become the world's foremost country in wealth, in technology, and in vigor of intellect. The combination of these qualities is indeed something of which you can be justifiably proud.
America has grown through challenge, not conformism. To quote a historian: ""America was born of revolt, flourished in dissent, and became great through experimentation.""
Our challenges in India have not been less. We have charted our own course, fortunate in leaders who took sustenance from our timeless philosophy, as well as modern concepts, putting them to work as instruments of action.
Our national movement reinforced the age-old unity which had held our country together through the ups and downs of history, across the shifting borders of hundreds of kingdoms, and bridging succeeding dynasties. After independence it was our task to usher in a more egalitarian society which would ensure social and economic justice to all regardless of religion, caste, language, or sex. For us economic progress means not only material well-being but moving nearly 500 million from one age to another, with the minimum dislocation or alienation from their roots.
Few things are good or bad in themselves. Their effect and importance lies in what one makes of them. Tradition, especially ours, which has been a factor for unity, for tolerance, and harmony, and for our people's cultural literacy, can be used as a tool, paradoxical though it may sound, for change and modernity. Life for a person or a country is a series of choices, not between the correct and the incorrect, which a computer can make, but in terms of opting for a course which will be consistent with our ethos and individuality, our past history and future aspirations.
Our struggle for independence was nonviolent. We chose democracy based on the British system but with some modifications, and the American Constitution influenced the shaping of our own Constitution. Our planning is not for regimentation, but to help us to take rational decisions and meet the competing demands of different sections of society and regions.
In India, as in the U.S.A., we have a private sector as well as a public sector. I see no conflict between the two. We have persevered in the face of criticism, of aggression, of different types of interferences. We are not satisfied with our success; we could have done better. Yet, notwithstanding the tremendous odds, we have moved forward.
There has been significant progress in agriculture and industry, in science and technology, and in the social services. The very fact that life expectancy has gone up by 20 years indicates improvement in living and working conditions. We aim at self-reliance. So, it is befitting that 90 percent of the resources needed for this gigantic endeavor of modernizing the country have come from our own people, impoverished though they are thought to be. But the remaining 10 percent or so is important, for that represents the inflow of modern technology.
In this we have been helped by the United States, by countries of Western and Eastern Europe, and several international institutions. We particularly appreciate American technical assistance. In consonance with our independent stand, we take cooperation in science, trade, or defense requirements from wherever it suits our national interest.
If India were considered in economic or military terms, it would not count. Yet our voice is heard, because in spite of our poverty and economic backwardness and often looking beyond our immediate interests, we have fearlessly spoken up for the rights of the underprivileged and the threatened and have championed the cause of peace and freedom. We have always viewed our problems in the much larger perspective of global problems.
Our foreign policy is one of friendship for all, hence our nonalignment. We are against the involvement of foreign troops or any other interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We believe in negotiations rather than the use of arms in settling disputes.
India is a large area of stability in South Asia. Undoubtedly its strengthening will help to stabilize and strengthen the entire region.
It is good that meetings between heads of state and government, individually and at conferences, are taking place more often. They do take us away from urgent tasks at home, but national and international problems are increasingly interlinked. Cancun dealt with various global issues, Versailles with the economic and other problems of the North, touching also on North-South questions. At the New Delhi Meeting of Developing Countries, the focus was on cooperation between themselves.
On earlier occasions I have pointed out that the future of advanced and developing countries is so closely intertwined that cooperation would benefit both. This is not merely a question of social justice and equity. My own view is that developing countries can contribute significantly to the emerging world economic order. Theirs are the potentially large markets which would help developed countries like the United States to maintain higher profitability on their investment, higher rates of growth, and to generate more employment.
To our minds there are three main causes of the present disturbing situation: the growth of armaments; the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, both between and within nations; and the thoughtless wounding of our Earth.
The world is one, yet we treat it as many, giving different names to the segments. As they are politically used, the words, East and West, North and South, are not even geographically apt. More than 3,000 years ago, when the world was greener, the sages of my country wrote an ode to the Earth. It is so pertinent today that I should like to share some lines with you.
""Do not push me from the west or from the east, or from the north or the south;Be gracious to us, O Earth; let not those find us who waylay people on the road;Take deadly weapons far away from us.""
Mr. President, may I say how much I appreciate your invitation to me. In a world where crises so swiftly follow one another, it is important to keep in touch and exchange views even if one cannot agree on all points.
We have had, as you have just told us, discussions which have been important and useful to us and, I think, which have created better understanding. I thank you once again, and Mrs. Reagan, for your gracious hospitality, for this delightful evening in such elegant and impressive surroundings.
May I now ask you all, ladies and gentlemen, to join me in a toast to the health of the President and the gracious First Lady, to the well-being of the American people, and to friendship between our two countries.
"
state-dinners,Donald J. Trump,"September 20, 2019","
President Trump. Prime Minister Morrison, Mrs. Morrison: Melania and I are immensely honored to host you and the entire Australian delegation for a State Dinner in the historic Rose Garden. I want to thank America's magnificent First Lady for this truly exquisite evening. Thank you very much to Melania. She worked hard. Thank you. Great job.
Tonight we celebrate more than a century of loyal and devoted friendship between the United States and Australia. Both of our nations are blessed by the uncommon courage, unfailing commitment, and unyielding character. Our two countries were born out of a vast wilderness, settled by the adventurers and pioneers whose fierce self-reliance shaped our destiny.
The first settlers carved out a home on the frontier and forged our defining national traits. Americans and Australians hold within our hearts a great love of family, a profound allegiance to our fellow citizens, a deep respect of law and liberty, and a determination to protect our independence at any cost. It is this free and proud spirit that has always driven our people to imagine, to build, to achieve what others never even dreamed possible.
From the wide-open landscapes of the West and the Outback rose up cowboys and sheriffs, rebels and renegades, miners and mountaineers. Against incredible hardships, our people have produced abundant harvests, pushed the bounds of science and exploration, and created timeless masterpieces of art, music, and culture. The defiant spirit of our people has also armed our nations with the strength to overcome any foe that dares to trample on our sovereignty, threaten our citizens, or challenge our freedom.
This evening we honor every Aussie and American hero who has paid the supreme sacrifice so that we might live in safety and in peace. In June of 1940, during the Second World War, a renowned Australian writer published a song in the Australian Women's Weekly. The song rallied the entire nation, and it remains an inspiration to patriots everywhere. Its lyrics are now printed on Australia's 10-dollar banknote.
The poem concludes by reminding the world that Aussies will always defend their cherished homeland. And it says:
We are the sons of Australia,
of the men who fashioned the land;
We are the sons of the women
Who walked with them hand in hand;
And we swear by the dead who bore us,
By the heroes who blazed the trail,
No foe shall gather our harvest,
Or sit on our stockyard rail.
As many of our friends with us here tonight know well, the acclaimed Australian author who penned these beautiful lines was Dame Mary Gilmore, and her great-great-nephew is Prime Minister Morrison.
Prime Minister Morrison. Thank you. That was beautiful.
President Trump. Prime Minister, on behalf of all Americans, our entire country: We are grateful that you carry on this noble legacy. We give thanks to all the sons and daughters of Australia who have toiled and sacrificed for a strong, vibrant, and sovereign nation. So this evening I offer a toast to the Prime Minister and Jennifer—thank you, Jennifer—and to every citizen of Australia: May our heroes forever inspire us, may our heritage always guide us, may our values always unite us, and may our nations always remain the home of the proud and the brave and the free.
I'd like to raise a glass to very special people and a very, very special country. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you very much.
[At this point, President Trump offered a toast.]
I now invite Prime Minister Morrison to the podium. Mr. Prime Minister. Thank you.
Prime Minister Morrison. Well, he got me. [Laughter] Dame Mary, my great-great-aunt, would be very, very proud.
Mr. President, First Lady, Mrs. Trump: Thank you so much, Mrs. Trump, for the amazing night you've created for us here. Ladies and gentlemen, friends: Jenny and I are truly grateful for this wonderful honor and the hospitality that you, Mr. President and the First Lady, have extended to us and to our country as we join you here tonight in the home—your home—and that of the American Presidency.
This of course was once the house of President Teddy Roosevelt, who I've always greatly admired. He was also a New Yorker.
President Trump. That's true.
Prime Minister Morrison. And he was also unconventional. [Laughter] He was no captive of the establishment. He was also accomplished; indeed, some might say, a maverick. But he was his own man. He was a doer. And above all, he was inspired by the great character of the American people. There is nothing he believed his nation could not do. And this is the heart of American greatness.
Mr. President, your belief in America and its people echoes this great spirit of that great President, and it's backed up by you life's experience and the passion and work of your Presidency. And, Mrs. Trump, your kindness, warmth, and quiet grace in the welcome to Jenny and I and especially here tonight has been very special and, as Jen has said, very sweet.
General Washington once said, ""It is infinitely better to have a few good many than many indifferent ones."" But the same is true in the friendship of nations. Australia will never be accused of indifference in our friendship to the United States. And tonight, Mr. President, we are reminded that the United States feels the same way, especially under your leadership.
I've noticed tonight the marines who are on duty tonight, and I thank you for your service, but not just to the United States, but to our alliance as well. In 1943, the U.S. Marine 1st Division was engaged in the first-ever, large-scale U.S. offensive against the Japanese at Guadalcanal. At the same time, Australian forces were in New Guinea, also locked in the fiercest of battles against the Japanese.
We both prevailed, each doing our bit, each carrying our own weight. When the U.S. Marine 1st Division arrived in Melbourne after 6 months of heavy fighting, they were welcomed with a rendition of the Australian fake anthem, ""Waltzing Matilda."" More than 75 years, later, the 1st Division still plays ""Waltzing Matilda"" whenever they ship out.
It's true, Mr. President: We have been in a lot of battles. But we have also stood together to realize the dividend of peace: prosperity that comes from our embrace of enterprise and free markets and the rule of law, our great immigration societies, education, liberal democracy, and a commitment to the fulfillment of human potential. This has been importantly included in our work together to expand the frontiers of science, technologies, and exploration to reach into space as we first did together 50 years ago, when you launched and we kept Apollo 11 in contact, through the Honeysuckle Project, with Earth. And we beamed those most famous of images of all time to an enthralled and inspired humanity. Events that no doubt inspired a young Andy Thomas, from Adelaide, who is with us here tonight, to launch into space on the Endeavor almost 30 years later.
And now we have to do this again, under the vision of your Presidency, Mr. President. Our generation and our times call this great republic and our great commonwealth to live up to the calling of young, free nations to continually point the way to freedom.
In Australia, we're reminded of this friendship by the great spire with the eagle atop that looks out across our nation's capital in Canberra. And earlier today we gifted a bronze statue of Les ""Bull"" Allen, an Australian soldier, carrying a wounded marine off the battlefield on steep slopes in New Guinea in 1943. For his gallantry, he was awarded the U.S. Silver Star and the Military Medal whilst fighting alongside U.S. troops.
Mr. President, we would be honored if you would permit Australia, as our gift, to erect a life-size memorial of this image here in Washington at a place of your choosing as a constant reminder of our dedication to our American friends and the bottom—and the bonds we have formed.
But for now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast. Thank you. To 100 years of mateship, and to 100 more, to the people of these United States, to the President and his magnificent First Lady, and may God bless America.
[Prime Minister Morrison offered a toast.]
President Trump. Thank you. Beautiful.
Prime Minister Morrison. That's great.
President Trump. Thank you very much. That's so beautiful. Thank you. Thank you, Scott.
I would like to invite a very special person up to the podium to say a blessing, Reverend Franklin Graham. Thank you, Franklin. Thank you very much.

The President. It's been a pleasure for Nancy and me to welcome the Prime Minister and Mrs. Suzuki to Washington. Our discussions today have been positive and constructive and I think have served to deepen the understanding between our two countries. As we talked, I thought again about the differences and the similarities between Japan and America, and I was struck by how much more profound the similarities are. We are two nations based on freedom, free enterprise, private industry, and democracy. We have become principal trading partners and chief competitors. [Laughter]
There's a legend in Japan about two villages separated by a river, and on moonlight nights a man from one town would come out and sing. And his voice would resound farther and farther, floating out across the river until it reached the other town. Meanwhile, the people of the second town decided to compete. They looked for a singer who could surpass the excellence of the man across the river. And then it happened that one night another voice was heard, and the second was fully as rich as the first. And when the original singer heard it, he realized he was faced with a strong rival, and he sang and sang at the top of his voice. And the singing grew more and more beautiful as each singer found depths to his talent that he hadn't known were there.
Well, Japan and America are like those singers. We each seek great achievements, and the standards we set for each other are marks of excellence. And yet we do not exhaust ourselves in the contest, but rather, pursue our respective goals as friends and allies.
The Japanese-American relationship is the anchor of American policy in East Asia. It is a pillar of strength in a world where democratic values are always under challenge. Our friendship is based on respect and mutual trust. America will honor her commitments to Japan, and we will continue to consult fully as true partners. Together we confront a serious world situation.
Energy supplies are uncertain. Economies are fragile. The Soviet Union continues its aggression, and the dynamics of the Persian Gulf are precarious. And the United States will play an active role in addressing these challenges, and we welcome Japan's determination to participate as a full partner in behalf of world peace. Just as we will count on Japan, Japan can count on America.
We will continue our respective search for excellence, and we shall cooperate with each other, bringing to the world the high standards of the future a little more quickly. The voices that call to each other across the Pacific will remain in harmony.
And with that goal in mind I ask all of you to join me in a toast to the Prime Minister and to Mrs. Suzuki and to the strong and growing and enduring friendship between Japan and the United States.
The Prime Minister. President and Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen:
Let me first express my sincere gratitude to President Reagan for this splendid banquet and for your warm greetings to my wife and me and the Japanese people. Though I have met with you only this morning for the first time, Mr. President, this gathering tonight and your warm hospitality make me feel as if we have known each other for many years.
I was born on the Pacific coast of the northern part of Japan and grew up beside the roaring surf coming from the east. California, which has been your home for so many years, is facing my home country across the Pacific. I spent my youth dreaming of America, the land of liberty, lying far across the sea. Belonging as we do to the same generation, Mr. President, I expect that you and I share a similar experience of the vicissitudes of our times. Add to that the fact that Japan and the United States have a long history of helping each other as true friends, and-it is natural that I should feel a deep sense of friendship for you, Mr. President, as if we had known each other for many, many years.
Mr. President, allow me to mention two recent events in the United States which have moved me very deeply. The first has to do with the unfortunate incident you came across a short time ago. My colleagues and I, and indeed the people of Japan as a whole, were all deeply distressed to learn of that regrettable event. What struck us most of all, however, was the fortitude and devotion with which Mrs. Reagan supported you and the calm presence of mind and admirable sense of humor which you, Mr. President, displayed in dealing with the situation. The affairs of state, in the meantime, remained in firm and reliable hands, and at no time was there any cause for concern among your allies about the United States leadership capability. Japan's faith in the United States of America has been greatly enhanced.
The second event is the heroic achievement of the space shuttle Columbia. Despite the fact that it was after 3 a.m. local time, over 3 million Japanese sat glued to their television sets to watch the Columbia's successful return to Earth. The frontier spirit of the American people has been a constant source of courage and inspiration to the Japanese people, and frontier spirit is in perfect harmony with our traditional spirit of enterprise.
Ladies and gentlemen, President Reagan and I have today reaffirmed how important solidarity and cooperation between Japan and the United States is to the prosperity of mankind in the years to come. We have also affirmed that Japan-U.S. partnership has grown to be an indispensable element in the peace and stability of the Asian-Pacific region, as well as that of the international community as a whole.
The present turbulent international situation makes me intensely aware of the precious value of freedom that Japan, the United States, and other democracies have consistently defended over the years. We must cooperate in pooling our wisdom to build still more peaceful and vigorous societies imbued with the spirit of freedom. As the Prime Minister of Japan, I am determined to do everything I can to join hands with you, Mr. President, and to work together for the sake of the future generations of the 21st century.
The success of the space shuttle inspires us to challenge the unknown. Tireless effort to build a better world for the future is a common task for the people of all nations. I would like to share with you this spirit of challenge.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention one more reason why I feel as if President Reagan is an old friend. We were born in the same year and are both proud of being a youthful 70. [Laughter] I have to admit, however, Mr. President, that I cannot match your health and vitality. This is because I was born, unfortunately, 26 days before you, which gives you that much edge. [Laughter]
More seriously, Mr. President, I wish to congratulate you on the great victory sign for your administration today as your budget has passed Congress.
Let me conclude by offering a toast to the health of the President and Mrs. Reagan and to the prosperity of the people of the United States of America.

state-dinners,George Bush,"January 06, 1992","
Mr. President, Mrs. Roh, distinguished guests, tonight we have much to celebrate, first and foremost our solid alliance. Many think that our partnership was born that moment 40 years ago when we joined forces against aggression. But it dates back over a century. When your nation looked outward for diplomatic and commercial opportunity, it looked then first to the United States. Today, our alliance has grown into a political, economic, and security partnership. I assure you, our commitment will continue well into the 21st century.
As you said, Mr. President, during your visit to the White House, ""Democracy in Korea is on course and is moving inexorably forward."" Through hard work and commitment, the Republic of Korea has moved from a war-ravaged past to a prosperous present and an enviable future.
This republic's progress in resolving differences with your brothers in the North is a great step in the journey toward the day when all of Korea is free. I admire your steadfastness and commitment to a peaceful resolution. The many successes of your Nordpolitik policy, your enhanced relations with Russia and China, your active dialog with North Korea, move us closer to that day. If North Korea can truly abandon not only its nuclear weapons program but its belligerence as well, that ribbon of land at the 38th parallel will no longer divide this nation.
Mr. President, we know each other well; I know you are a modest man. Your leadership of the Republic of Korea during this period of incredible change has earned you an honorable place in the wonderful history of this nation. You've knocked down trade barriers, opened markets, and your nation's economy has prospered. With each election your country holds, at least three this year, free ideas and opinions flourish. Under your leadership, at long last South Korea took its rightful place in the United Nations.
So, Mr. President, with many thanks for a visit that we will long cherish and long remember, I raise my glass and ask all of you to join me, a glass to peace and unification for Korea, to your leadership of the Republic of Korea, to peace and prosperity, to the wonderful people of this land that we treasure as true friends. To you, sir, Mrs. Roh. And thank you all for a magnificent time. To your health, sir.

Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Mr. President, Mrs. Pastrana, members of the Colombian delegation, distinguished guests, it's a great pleasure to welcome all of you to the White House for this dinner in honor of the President and the First Lady of Colombia.
Today President Pastrana and I worked hard to advance the partnership between Colombia and the United States. Tonight we celebrate our friendship, among friends. It is a long friendship, indeed, going back to our struggles for independence, including, as President Pastrana discussed today, an alliance in war as well as peace.
After all these years, the United States remains captivated by Colombia, by the power of Colombian art, the force of Colombian literature, and I might add, the strength of Colombian coffee. [Laughter] Indeed, if ever a prize is given to any of the people who negotiated the peace treaty at Wye, something will have to be given to Colombia, for without the coffee it would not have occurred. [Laughter]
The United States is grateful for the many contributions Colombians make to our national life, as students, teachers, athletes, and every occupation between.
Mr. President, your election this summer marks the beginning of a new era in your country's history and in our long relationship. Bravely, you have placed Colombia on the path to peace. You have taken hard steps toward renewed prosperity. We look forward to walking with you into the 21st century. We still have much to learn from and to give to each other.
We live in a hemisphere on a planet growing ever smaller. In our independence, every day we grow more interdependent. If we would be strong, we must lift others. If we would fulfill our own promise, we must help others live their dreams. We must, in short, go forward together.
In the last phrase of what has famously become known in the United States as my favorite novel, ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" our guest and friend tonight, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, says, ""Races condemned to 100 years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on Earth."" In the 21st century let us move away from isolation, solitude, loneliness, to build 100 years of an American family together.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join me in a toast to the President and First Lady of Colombia and to the people of their great land.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 01, 1986","
Mr. President, Mrs. Soeharto, the Ministry, ladies and gentlemen, Nancy and I are delighted to be with you tonight. It's a great honor to be visiting Indonesia again and to receive the warm hospitality and gracious welcome for which the Indonesian people are justly famous. I remember how much I enjoyed my visit to Indonesia in December of 1973 when I was Governor of California and here representing our President at the time. I also recall with pleasure, Mr. President, your visit to the United States in October of 1982. I remember well that in your dinner toast you suggested, ""Like it or not, we must consider the world as the common homeland of all nations.""
Well, Mr. President, the American people are honored that, as citizens of the world, we count as our close and trusted friends the people of Indonesia. Americans see Indonesia as an impressive success story. In just over 40 years, this vast and beautiful nation has made enormous strides. We Americans appreciate that the path to national union is not easy for a country that spans over 3,000 miles and is scattered across more than 13,600 islands. The challenges you face in developing your country, with its wide expanse and rich diversity, are not unlike the obstacles and hazards Americans faced in settling and developing our own country.
Despite regional diversity, Indonesia, under your leadership, Mr. President, is a united country, a country that is assuming an increasingly significant role in the region and in the world. Your commitment to Indonesian resilience, drawing on your own resources and your own traditions and institutions, serves to enrich your people materially and spiritually. In the United States our governing institutions celebrate the wisdom of a balance of power that works to shape our laws and traditions. Indonesia's governing philosophy of consultation and consensus is different from our own, yet its ultimate goal is blending diversity into national unity. Even though our methods of government differ, the friendly and open nature of the discussions we've had here and when you were in Washington reflect the positive and constructive day-to-day, year-to-year conduct of relations between our two countries.
I want to congratulate you, Mr. President, on Indonesia's achievement in reaching self-sufficiency in rice production. This is an enormous accomplishment of which you can be justifiably proud. Having moved so far, so fast in providing ample food resources is another indication of your government's effective management. The attainment of rice self-sufficiency is just one indication that Indonesia's economic development program has been wide-reaching and impressive. This program of growth and advancement has been directed toward bringing the benefits of development to all levels of society. Mr. President, not too long ago you said, ""It is impossible to reach equity in development, impossible to wipe out poverty, if there is no economic growth."" Well, we applaud that emphasis. We have a saying in the United States that rather than talk about how to divide a small pie, let's work and build and bake a bigger pie so everyone can have a bigger slice. Mr. President, we have been happy to cooperate with you in a number of social and economic fields, including food production, off-farm employment, private sector development, and health care. We look forward to continuing our work together. In this regard, we have found the growing cooperation between our two nations in the field of science and technology to be particularly beneficial.
Indonesia is also to be congratulated, Mr. President, for its humanitarian policy of granting first asylum to almost 100,000 refugees from Indochina. The international community and the American people applaud Indonesia for its generous response to the plight of these unfortunate people who are seeking freedom and refuge. Many of these refugees have also resettled on our shores and have enriched the fabric of American life. The plight of these friends in distress is very important to Americans. I want to express to you, Mr. President, my personal appreciation for the sacrifice and consideration your government has shown in this humanitarian endeavor.
I am struck by how our discussions have reflected a mutuality of interests and a harmony of views. And I am confident the spirit that has prevailed here will enable us to forge even stronger relations in the years ahead. And I would ask you all to join me then in toasting the people of Indonesia; their distinguished leader, President Soeharto; and the friendship between the Indonesian and American people.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"June 27, 2013","
[At this point, President Sall made remarks in French, which were translated by an interpreter, as follows.]
President Sall. Your Excellency, Mr. President Barack Obama; distinguished First Lady Michelle Obama; distinguished First Lady of Senegal Marieme Sall; distinguished members of the American delegation; distinguished Speaker of the Parliament; distinguished Prime Minister; Madame President of the Economic, Social and Environmental Council; distinguished senior ministers; distinguished ministers; honorable Members of Parliament; Your Excellencies, distinguished Ambassadors; dear friends and dear guests.
Mr. President, 3 months after having warmly received me at the White House, you are visiting me with your wife, your children, and the important delegation accompanying you. And you have honored us by choosing Senegal as your entry point to Africa for your first visit to the continent since your brilliant reelection last November.
In relationships between states, every choice conveys a symbol and a message. My fellow countrymen and myself, we understand and appreciate your visit as a token of friendship and esteem for us. This feeling, Mr. President, is mutual, and it is for you and for your great people.
[President Sall spoke in English.]
We welcome you, Mr. President, and First Lady Michelle Obama. We wish you and your delegation a pleasant stay in Senegal, the Land of Teranga.
[President Sall spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter, as follows.]
Ties between the American and Senegalese peoples are ancient, robust, and trustworthy. And the circumstances of history have bequeathed common memories to us.
In 1776, when the American people started their historical struggle for their freedom, in the north of Senegal, some revolutionaries rebelled the same year for the same principles of justice and freedom against excesses committed by the authorities in place. In 1761, according to Johnson and Patricia Smith in ""Africans in America,"" it was said that in 1761, a 7-year-old Senegalese girl embarked for a one-way trip. She disembarked in Boston. Phillis Wheatley, which was her slave name, thanks to her creative genius, became the first known black poetess in the United States of America.
This was a ray of light in our common history, even in the dark hours of slavery. More than two centuries later, another trip has united us, and this time, as free citizens. And, Mr. President, you wrote this in your bestseller, ""Dreams From My Father."" It was in Spain, in a bus bound for Barcelona; you took a liking to one of my compatriots, Mr. Sellé Dieng. I hope he is here in this room. Selle—he's here.
[Sellé Dieng shook hands with President Obama.]
Thank you, Sellé.
And, Mr. President, so in this book of yours, you said that he told you about his wife he had left behind in Senegal and of his dream to earn enough money to bring her over. He offered coffee and water to you: a coincidental meeting, a shared history, a small gesture of kindness, you said. This spontaneous gesture of human fraternity expresses the values uniting Senegalese and Americans, definite and strong values: faith in God, family and work, openness to the other, and attachment to democracy and freedom.
This is the reason why so many of my fellow countrymen feel so comfortable in your country and are successfully pursuing their American Dream. In Harlem, we have ""Little Senegal"" when you go to the 16th Street. It's well known to all our compatriots. We would like to thank the American people for their tradition of hospitality.
I would like to also commend the excellent quality of our bilateral relations. Our two countries are cooperating for peace and a safer world, rid of scourges of terrorism and cross-border crime. I commend your leadership, particularly in these times when the situation here in the Sahel has become a global threat and deserves special attention. I hope our countries can put together a joint strategy in response to this new challenge.
In the economic and social fields, we have a robust partnership with the commitment of the Peace Corps in Senegal for more than half a century, USAID's actions and the existence of other aid instruments such as AGOA and the Millennium Challenge Account. Mr. President, I cannot forget that during the preelection turmoil, which our country went through in 2011 and 2012, the United States of America maintained their trust in the maturity and resilience of the Senegalese people and relentlessly supported our democratic tradition. We greatly appreciated this gesture of solidarity in between peoples with common values.
Today, as agreed to in Washington, I would like to confirm our will to forge ahead with you: forge ahead for the promotion of democracy and good governance in the spirit of our commitments stemming from the last G-8 summit; forge ahead in opening new opportunities of partnership between our countries; forge ahead for the promotion of the youth; for the growth and prosperity of our peoples in a safer world.
[President Sall spoke in English.]
Looking back to more than 50 years of commitment and achievement between our two countries, I am confident that even greater opportunities are laying ahead. And I want to tell you and the great American people that we are more than willing to go forward in our renewed partnership. And we are ready; yes, we are ready; and yes, we can. [Laughter]
[President Sall spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter, as follows.]
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to raise a toast to the health and well-being of our illustrious guests, President Barack Obama of the United States of America, the First Lady Michelle Obama, to whom I'd like to pay my respects; to the health and well-being of their children and their delegation; and to the continuous prosperity of the friendly American people.
Long live the United States of America. Long live Senegal. Long live the friendship between Senegal and the United States of America. Thank you, and God bless you.
President Obama. President Sall, Madame First Lady, distinguished guests and friends: On behalf of myself and Michelle and our children, our entire delegation, we want to thank you for the incredible hospitality that you've shown us today. We have been deeply moved and are deeply appreciative of all the arrangements that you've made.
I am told that you have a tradition here of singing poets. Do not worry, I am not going to sing. [Laughter] But I would like to quote from one of your greatest poets—one of the world's greatest poets—your first President, Léopold Senghor.
The year after Senegal achieved independence, President Senghor came to the White House and met with President Kennedy. And during his visit to the United States, President Senghor said, ""Senegal is a small country, but it is a republic which is inspired by the principles of democracy.""
And here in Senegal, we've seen—I've seen personally—the principles of democracy at work in this generation and, I believe, in future generations. Mr. President, I salute you and your administration for seeking what you have called a new mindset, a new consciousness, government that upholds the sanctity of the public good.
I've seen the principles of democracy in Senegal's commitment to human dignity. Michelle and I will never forget today's visit to Goree Island, where we looked out that door of no return. The world owes so much to Senegal for preserving this piece of history, one of the world's great heritage sites.
And as I said at Goree Island, it's a reminder of the potential in humanity that we can show one another, but it also, I think, reminds us of how vigilant we have to be in upholding the dignity and rights of all people.
And finally, I've seen the principle of democracy in the people of Senegal: the citizens that I met with today who stood up for democracy; the young girls that Michelle met today who are busy shaping this nation—just incredible young women—because Senegal recognizes the value of women's leadership.
And I couldn't be here today if I didn't mention that today, back in the United States, is NBA draft day—[laughter]—and that there's going to be a team that makes a wise decision by drafting a favorite son of Senegal, Gorgui Dieng, who is an outstanding big man, and maybe the Bulls will get him. So—[applause].
So, Mr. President, I want to propose a toast to our gracious hosts, to our two great nations, to the abiding friendship between our peoples. À votre santé. Salut. Thank you.
"
state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"March 05, 1980","
THE PRESIDENT. When I tapped on my glass, nobody got quiet, but when- [laughter] —when Chancellor Schmidt tapped on his glass, instantly—absolute silence.
It's a distinct honor and a pleasure for us to have all of you here in the White House and particularly to have our guests from Germany here from the Federal Republic, both Chancellor Schmidt and his wife, his distinguished associates in the (government, and a group of both business and labor leaders from the Federal Republic, who have honored us with their presence.
I think, as all of you know, we in the Western World, perhaps in the entire world, face very difficult challenges—financial, economic, social, military, political challenges. And it's a great assurance, and a feeling of stability and thanksgiving comes over a President when he has a guest and a friend like Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
This is a time of difficulty for us all. It's a time of potential crisis. It's a time when we need the closest possible allies and friends. It's a time when it's both reassuring and helpful to have someone on whom we can depend who is experienced and enlightened and strong and courageous, and I think this litany of descriptive words accurately fits our guest tonight, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
I have not known him except for the last 5 or 6 years. I met him first when I was a Governor, in a brief trade visit to the Federal Republic. He was the Finance Minister of his country at that time. Since then, we've both been promoted to some degree. [Laughter] But I came there at a time when we were searching for additional investments in our own State. It was the time of Watergate. And when I went into Helmut's office, he said, ""If you'll spend 30 minutes explaining Watergate to me, I'll spend 30 minutes helping you with your economic mission."" [Laughter] So, we became early friends then. He was a very good host for me. And since then, we've learned to respect him and to know him as a great world leader.
In the early seventies or even before, I think Chancellor Schmidt was one of the first men in a position of top leadership to recognize the crucial need for a correlation between economic strength and analysis on the one hand and military strength and commitment on the other, and how those two might be welded for the Atlantic Alliance.
When I first began to meet with him after I became President, we were in London, the first year of my own term in office. And Helmut Schmidt was the one that put forward, in the most clear and concise and understandable terms, the need for all of us leaders of the Western democracies to address the very complicated issue of energy and how the future portended, for us all, a time of challenge and a time of difficulty, but a time when our enlightened communication with one another might help to alleviate the concerns that we all felt so deeply. His economic analysis of it, his knowledge of the background of the energy shortage development, his relationship with the OPEC countries was of great benefit to us then.
Later, of course, I think Helmut was the first one to recognize the growing threat to Western Europe and to the NATO alliance of the unpublicized buildup of Soviet theater nuclear weapons. And he presented the case very clearly to the rest of us, and we began to study this issue more thoroughly. And eventually he exerted again his strong leadership in Western Europe to encourage our allies to work with us in committing ourselves jointly to meet this threat in a carefully planned, moderate, but effective way, not to cause an escalation in tension or an escalation in division among us, but to cause us to address the question in the most effective possible fashion.
We recognize that there are serious threats to stability and that we have come, in this last few years, to value highly the benefits of detente and to recognize clearly that in spite of all of our other possible diversion of issues that are important, the control of weaponry and the control of nuclear weaponry must be at the top of our agenda. These commitments have been shaken, but not changed, by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
We are still committed to detente. We are still committed to avoid a resumption of the cold war. We are still committed to the control of nuclear and conventional weapons: We are still committed to cooperation among nations on Earth. We are still committed to stability and to peace. And we are still committed to making sure that every action we take to alleviate crises is a peaceful action and is a constructive action that will help to achieve our goals without violating these deep commitments and principles on which our Nation's policies have been founded.
I might say that our country has been both deeply concerned and aroused by the capture of the American hostages and the holding of them as prisoners. At this very moment, this gross illegality is being perpetrated against innocent Americans. I never forget them for one instant of my waking moments. And I know American people have appreciated deeply the strong and consistent support and the beneficial influence that has been exerted by the Federal Republic of Germany under the leadership of Helmut Schmidt.
Our alliance is firm, and the solidarity of it is vital. And it's also extremely important to let the public know that there is no division among us, that we do stand together to face challenges, crises, and opportunities for the future.
We had a long discussion this afternoon about these matters and many others. We took a long time to discuss them; we were not in a hurry. Both of us set aside the afternoon for this purpose. And it was extremely helpful to me, as President of our country, to have the advice and the counsel of our visitor, Helmut Schmidt.
We have to recognize that our policy toward those who might threaten peace must be clear, it must be consistent, it must be comprehensible; there must not be any room for miscalculation. And that's the effort that we have mounted. We also recognize that alliances, to be strong, must be voluntary. They cannot be formed through coercion. They must be based on mutual ideals, mutual concepts, and mutual goals. They must be mutually beneficial on a continuing basis. And we also recognize that strong societies have to be dependent upon the freedom of those who comprise them.
This evening I'm very grateful that Helmut Schmidt and I lead two great nations who comprise alliances of many kinds, based on voluntary association, based upon shared ideals, shared concepts, shared goals, and shared commitments. And I would like to ask you to join me in a toast to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and his lovely wife, to the people whom they represent in the Federal Republic of Germany, bound to us through alliances, through friendship, and through a common dedication to peace and to freedom.
THE CHANCELLOR. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
I would like to, in the first instance, thank you, Mr. President, for your kind and friendly and even flattering words in the beginning. I would also like to thank you, on behalf of my wife and members of my delegation, for having invited us.
I would like to thank you and your Cabinet officers and others whose advice we had, starting yesterday night and all over today, and will have tomorrow on several issues, in several fields—the economy, financial problems, monetary problems, energy problems, foreign policy and international affairs, our common defenses. And, which matters most, I would like to thank you personally for the continuation of the very frank and open way in which we have come to talk and listen to each other over the couple of years you have been mentioning a minute ago.
I'm not so sure how often I have been visiting the United States in the last 30 years, but it might be the 40th or the 45th visit now, which puts the American President at the advantage to ask for me to talk in your own language. But I still have a little difficulty as you've just noticed.
President Jimmy Carter has not said one single word or not said one single sentence to which I could not subscribe a hundred percent. And so, it would be easy for me just to state this truth that I can subscribe, not only as an individual but speaking for my government, speaking for my nation, that I am in a position to subscribe to it a hundred percent and then sit down again. But I guess that some of you would like to hear me express a few of the thoughts which come to my mind in listening to your President. [Applause]
Jimmy, let me say this: I regard this clapping your hands as an unfriendly provocation. [Laughter] I will try to respond to that kind of provocation.
I think the President is right in stating that we are living in an uneasy period of the development of this world. At least we feel it to be the same situation as you expressed it 5 minutes ago. We feel especially irritated, frustrated, we share your bitter feelings as regards the capturing of your hostages in Tehran. And we know very well what you are talking of, what we are talking of, in expressing our solidarity, because we have had some experiences of the same kind, not lasting 120 days, lasting a little shorter in our case, or cases—we had several such cases. But we very well understand, and we are feeling as you do.
And I have told my public and my Parliament: ""Imagine,"" I said to our countrymen, ""Imagine what feelings would be our feelings now if these were Germans and not Americans. And try to imagine how impatient we would be in the meantime and how many temptations would have occurred in the meantime for us to act harshly, intervene by means that one could think of."" And I always have, after having expressed this many, many times over the last 3 months, since the 4th of November—I always have added my great admiration for the statesmanship, for the prudence, admiration for the patience which you showed in dealing with that situation.
We deeply share your hope that you will be able to liberate these people, uninjured, and give them back to their families, to their wives. But it's not the only danger we are experiencing right now. There are other dangers as well.
The President and I have been talking quite a bit, and also the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense and also the Security Adviser to the President. And we have been talking about the problems of how—we in the West—do we shield ourselves against the dangers which are clear and present in the case of Afghanistan, in the case of theoretically thinkable repetitions of what has happened there, and what are the goals which we have to strive for in such a situation, what are the means that are in our hands, that are at our disposition, what are the ways by which we could effectively apply those means.
To speak frankly, if I read the European press or if I read the American press, one gets the impression of a great amount of irritation between Europe and the United States or between the United States and Europe regarding these subjects of our consultations. But to tell you the truth, ladies and gentlemen, I don't have, as a person, I don't feel these irritations. There are some false stories in the world.
And I take this opportunity to have a chance to talk to American citizens in order to ask a favor of you: namely, to tell your countrymen that not only my nation, the Germans for whom I am legitimated to speak, but also other European nations, other Europeans, know very well where they stand—namely, side to side with the American Nation—know very well that they cannot preserve their peace and their liberty without the Americans, that we are dependent on each other. And to quote a phrase from a very close friend of mine—not a German, but a Frenchman—""When all the chips are down, there's no doubt about our depending on you."" And to some degree we feel certain that, also, in such a situation you will need us Europeans.
We have been preparing for helping each other to preserve our freedom, to preserve our peace, for more than a quarter of a century now. And our longstanding alliance so far has been very, very effective, which has been overshadowed from time to time by the stories which are being printed in newspapers or by the stories which are being broadcasted by other media. We've been very, very effective.
There have been two World Wars in this century. Both of them were generated in central Europe, I hate to admit, both of them—the first one to quite a considerable degree, the second one totally generated in Germany. And we feel sure that there must not and that there will not be a third catastrophe in our lifetime, the span of our lifetime.
But having mentioned the two great wars, it comes to my mind that I had the intention, after having talked about the solidarity between us Europeans and you Americans, between us Germans and you Americans—that I had the intention after that to also mention the specific situation in which my nation finds itself.
It's sometimes been overlooked that the Federal Republic of Germany, which is a sovereign state, a state with a solid democracy, a solid economy, a solid political setup, a solid relationship between labor and entrepreneurs, rather agreeable economic performance—it sometimes has been overlooked that this is only a part of a nation and that there are 16 million Germans living outside our borders, living in a Communist state, a puppet state, under the immediate presence of I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers, ground forces as well as air force, and that it has taken us an enormous diplomatic, psychological effort to establish at least some ways and means and channels of communication with our countrymen, with our 16 million countrymen in the Communist orbit.
And they are the ones who would suffer in the first instance if we get back to the cold war. As the President said, this must be avoided. I fully share his view. These Germans would be the first ones, and the Berliners may be the second ones. And the Germans who still live in the Soviet Union proper would suffer as much as the Jews who are living in the Soviet Union and want to get permission to leave the Soviet Union—to get to Israel, for instance. They will be the ones who will suffer in a case of a cold war type confrontation.
Now, it is not only our choice to avoid that. The West is not the only partner in the global game. You have the Russians; you have a superpower there which is behaving in a way that implies threats to all our liberties, to all our freedom. We have to respond to that. Now we have the will to respond to it.
I would underline anything the President has said about our will to avoid falling back into a cold war, about our will to control armaments in a war, to hold them under control, to limit it mutually. And I would like to add, just as a footnote, one could also transcribe our joint will as a will to maintain an equilibrium of power vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. And we will not—neither will you nor will we nor will your other European allies-allow a situation in which, in the end, the Soviet Union could overwhelm their European neighbors or other nations in the world.
I would, just as a footnote, stress this necessity of a balance of military power in Europe and in the world as a prerequisite for detente. I am fully aware that the President and I share this view, but sometimes I have the impression that some American people, some writers or speakers in this country, seem to believe that we are only pursuing detente without seeing to the maintenance of the balance of power. This would be a false interpretation.
We are contributing quite a bit—we Germans are contributing quite a bit to this balance of military power in Europe. I'm rather proud of our contribution. And you can rest assured that we are going not only to maintain that but to modernize it and to add to it if necessary, as equilibrium or balance of power is nothing which you can create on Monday and rest assured for the rest of the week; you have to evaluate the situation again on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, Friday and Saturday and even on Sunday and have to reanalyze it next week and the week after next. And sometimes you will see that you have to mend your fences here or there. And all the time, you have to try to bring about equilibrium by mutual limitation of military force, mutual limitation on the control of the arms race, applied to the East as well as to the West.
I beg your pardon for having been a little bit too long in dwelling on this point. I have also another point in mind which I would like to present to you or share my thoughts with you. That is, after having talked about the basic attitude in which my people look upon their great ally and friend, the American Nation, I would like you to know that this has had already, so far, much greater an impact on our society, on the spirit in our society, even on our constitution than quite a few Americans understand and than quite a few Germans do understand.
For instance, we take pride in the fact that the Federal Republic of Germany, by any historic yardstick, now is the most stable democracy Germany ever has produced. They haven't produced so many democracies so far—only two of them. The first one failed after 12 or 13 years. And there were quite a few people in the world, including quite a few Germans, that did not believe that our people would be able, after the devastation of the Second World War—not only devastation in the physical sense of the word but even more so in the moral sense of the word—that we should have been able to bring about such political stability. But we did so with the help of our friends abroad, with the help of the French, the British, especially with the help of the Americans.
I would like to bring to your awareness, for instance, the constitution which we adopted 31 years ago. To a considerable part, especially as regards that part which is totally new to the history of constitutions in my country, namely, the basic rights for the individual, this stems—if you tried to trace the historical origins, this goes back to the American Revolution, it goes back to Philadelphia, it goes back to the spiritual development in this country more than 200 years ago. And it has produced a basic change of thinking about the role of the state versus the individual in my nation—a very sound and healthy change of thinking about the role of state or society, about the role of the individual.
I guess that historians, sometime to come in the future, will explore this or might detect for the first time what I'm trying to explain to you. There is a much greater heritage in Germany—we inherited much more from the United States, from the American people, than we are aware of and possibly than you are aware of. I'm not talking, which I also could, about all the amount of help we have been given by your Nation in the last 35 years.
Let me talk a little bit about the future, in making a third point in a little predinner speech. I think, by the way, it's a good habit to have the speeches before the dinner, because those who have to speak always sit here, eat their meat, in anxiety about the fact that they have to pay for it afterwards. Now you make us pay before the dinner, and that's a better method. But you still have to listen to a third point which I would like to make, a point about the future.
Please be assured that I cannot foresee, that my people, my nation cannot foresee a future for the democratic liberal type of society which you represent, which we represent, which others in Europe represent, which others in North America and other parts of the world do represent—I cannot foresee a future for that if not in a rather great amount of cooperation between those liberal democracies which we do represent. There ought to be a great amount of cooperation.
On the other hand, I do foresee a peaceful and successful future for the democracies in the world, because I'm quite sure that we'll be able to cooperate, that we don't only have the will but we do also have the capacity to cooperate. In so doing, we'll not always be in the position to do the same thing at the same time and to use the same language at the same time. You will use English, for instance; I will use German. And already this makes a difference, I can tell you, if I ask the people who had to write down the press release today, after noon. Some words sound different in English than they do sound in German, for instance.
We will not only use different languages, we will have, also, to fulfill different roles from time to time. That's even true of today. We fulfill some roles which are difficult for you, for instance. We did so over the last couple of years as regards aid and military aid included for Turkey. There are other examples in which you have to fulfill roles which we cannot dream of fulfilling by ourselves. It's natural that there is a certain amount of division of labor between people who cooperate. The same is true in a firm. The same is true in a lawyers firm. The same is true on the board of directors of an automobile firm. The same is true in the firm of the North Atlantic Alliance and in its cooperative group of Western nations.
The division of labor is not an invention of our day. If my memory is correct, it was at least invented earlier on by Adam Smith and David Ricardo, and they had their theories on it. And these theories do not only apply to economics, they also apply to politics. One must not misinterpret a division of labor as being a division of mind or a division of purpose. Several people working on the board of directors of one firm have a division of labor, but they have a common sense of purpose.
I am deeply convinced that we'll be successful, that the Western liberal democracies will be successful, because they do have a common sense of purpose, and they will always be able to, in common, define their goals for the foreseeable future.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, that you have listened so long. I would like to propose a toast to the President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, to his charming wife. I would also like to propose a toast to the wellbeing of the American nation. Especially I would like to include the 50 hostages in Tehran. I would also like to drink to the lasting cooperation and friendship between our two nations.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"June 13, 1994","
Ladies and gentlemen, Your Majesties, our other distinguished guests from Japan, ladies and gentlemen. We are honored and privileged to welcome this evening the Emperor and Empress of Japan.
You are no strangers to the United States, but it gives me particular pleasure to host you here at the White House on this, the occasion of your first visit to America since you ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne.
As citizens of a relatively young nation, we Americans are honored by your presence, and we deeply value the rich culture and history you represent. You embody a tradition that stretches back century after century and a people who have brought the world a civilization of great elegance.
At a time when the call of tradition so often clashes with the demands of the modern world, Your Majesties revere your ancestors and your past and, yet, revel in your own people's extraordinary ability to innovate for tomorrow.
Your personal interest in your nation's cultural heritage is matched by your vital curiosity about the world around you. And your travels have surely taken you far and wide. You have fully pursued professional knowledge, and yet, in your devotion to your family, you have set an example for us all. Through your words and deeds, Your Majesties have earned the respect and the admiration of the Japanese people. But those are sentiments we Americans also share.
Today, the ties that bind our two nations have never been stronger. The miracles of technology and the common search for democracy, prosperity, and peace have brought us together. Exchange between our two peoples has opened windows and shed great light. Yet, there is always more to learn. And as we gather here tonight in 1994, our relationship is still unfolding.
The Japanese poet Basho put it well in a haiku that sums up the distance ahead:
Nearing autumn's close,My neighbor—how does he live?I wonder.

May Your Majesties' visit provide new answers to that question and bring our peoples closer still. May your journey across our land be enjoyable and leave you wanting to visit us again. And may the sea that separates us be also a shining path between us.
Your Majesties, Hillary and I thank you for gracing our Nation's home tonight. It is with deep admiration and respect for you and the great nation you represent that I now ask all of us to raise our glasses to join in a toast to you and to the people of Japan.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"November 15, 2016","
President Pavlopoulos. Mr. President, I welcome you to Athens and to the Presidency of the Republic, as the President of the United States of America, who has constantly and consistently served with respect for man, for the consolidation of peace and the defense of democracy, and of its twin brother, the social rule of law, by holding in check the extreme inequalities which directly threaten social cohesion. We fully share those ideals.
Let me be even more specific. In this deep and prolonged economic and social crisis, which is plaguing our country and our people, for which we are far from being the only ones to blame, I would like to point out the following three things.
First, we deeply believe in representative democracy and in every one of its institutional dimensions. We are especially inspired by your emblematic constitutional tradition of checks and balances. It is these that shield popular sovereignty and parliamentary rule, as well as the independence of justice from many arbitrary interference by the executive or, even more, by the various instruments of globalization which lack any democratic legitimacy.
Second, we continue our unwavering course within the European Union, and its hard core, the euro zone, despite the huge economic and social burden of a mostly wrong and dead end austerity policy. And in respect of this, Mr. President, I'm very happy to hear—I was very happy to hear you point this out, and I hope that your words will urge our European partners to move in the right direction.
Alongside our partners, with which we share the true and selfless European path, we fight to restore the values and principles which were the foundations of European integration, mainly the respect of—for man and for social justice. These are the principles which will keep the nightmare of fascism and Nazism left behind by World War II forever in the dismal past. We never forget the decisive contribution of the United States of America in that war so that Europe could hold back the fate of what Mark Mazower called the ""Dark Continent."" We will always remember Omaha Beach in Normandy.
Third, Mr. President, we are responding with uncompromising dignity to the huge refugee crisis, which you have called of epic dimension, which is mainly the result of the war in Syria. We expect solidarity by our European partners, and we expect that they will open up their minds and listen to your opinion. In this, we are inspired by the ancient Greek institution of the supplement. At the same time, we are doing our part in the fight against the barbarism of jihadism, which is committing crimes against humanity.
But, Mr. President, in order to defend refugees and to stop terrorism, the war in Syria and in the wider region must end. This is the common objective, and this requires harmonious cooperation of the U.S., the EU, and Russia. And we're happy that you were able to fully understand this truth and have turned it into action with your wise and also visionary policy, and therefore, we start seeing the first results. Maybe late, but it is never too late.
Mr. President, we urge you from here, from Athens, with its eternal symbol of Parthenon—the Parthenon of democracy and civilization—to continue to serve the same ideals after the end of your term. Your appeal will continue into the future. In this future and very promising journey, we would like you to take Greece along. And at this point, I'd like to remember the words of the poet Odysseas Elytis: Please do not forget our country.
I will, therefore, conclude by—my address by reminding you of what André Malraux said in his memorable speech at the inauguration of the illumination of the Acropolis on 29th of—March 29, 1958: ""A secret Greece resides in the heart of all men of the West."" It is this secret Greece that the Greek people offer you as a gift during this visit, precisely because we deem it worthy of the U.S. President, Barack Obama.
Mr. President, on behalf of the Greek people, I wish you personal health and success. And I ask you to convey the Greek people's sincere warm wishes for growth and prosperity to our committed and great friends, the American people.
Once again, welcome, Mr. President.
President Obama. Kalispera. [Laughter] Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Once again, it is a great honor to be in Greece. And on behalf of myself and my delegation, on behalf of the American people, thank you for the warmth that you've shown us on this visit.
Of course, your hospitality comes as no surprise. As Pericles said in his famous oration many centuries ago: ""In nobility of spirit, we differ from most others in the way we conduct ourselves towards other people. We make friendships not by receiving kindness from others, but by conferring it on others."" And we certainly have felt the kindness of the Greek people conferred on us today.
I'll have more to say in my speech tomorrow about the ties of history and heritage that bind our peoples together. Of course, that does include our love of the Olympics. Greeks rightly take pride as the founder of the Games and in Leonidas of Rhodes who, for 2,000 years, held the record for winning 12 individual gold medals, the most of any athlete. And we Americans take pride in Michael Phelps, who set the new record this summer.
Besides that friendly competition, we are deeply grateful for our alliance with the Greek people. I think that we have inspired each other to reach for independence, stood in solidarity during war and peace, in good times and in bad, including these very difficult years for the Greek people. And tonight I want you to know that as you work to move your country forward, you will always have the support and friendship of the United States.
I want to close with a moment from our shared history. In 1821, as Greece began its fight for independence, a Greek patriot wrote a letter to the American Government appealing for assistance. ""Although a broad sea separates us,"" he wrote, ""your virtues, Americans, are close to ours."" And he added, ""We consider you as friends, copatriots and brothers.""
So——
[At this point, the interpreter began translating President Obama's remarks.]
Please.
[The interpreter continued.]
So, in appreciation for our friendship and your hospitality, if I might propose a toast: To the virtues and values that unite us across a broad sea. May Greeks and Americans always be there for each other: as friends, as copatriots, and brothers and sisters. Stin ygeia sas. [Laughter] Cheers. [President Obama offered a toast.]

state-dinners,George Bush,"January 09, 1992","
Your Imperial Majesties and honored guests, on behalf of the American people, we wish to thank you for the warmth of this reception and for your tireless efforts in support of the relationship between our two great nations.
The United States and Japan today stand on the threshold of a new era of cooperation in which our nations seek to build a new world of freedom and democracy. The task before us is daunting, one which will require vision and courage. But it is one from which we cannot shrink. Too much depends on us.
As leaders of this new world, we face several challenges together, addressing the new security requirements of a changed world, promoting freedom and democracy, and generating world economic growth and prosperity.
Tonight, we celebrate the essence of this new world order and the opportunity to be true partners in its construction. We see how former enemies can become close allies and friends, real friends, each supporting, competing, growing, dreaming. Each understands that we must resolve our differences fairly and constructively.
Our people both believe in work, community, faith, and family. We know how democracy supports the cause of peace among nations. We realize that although half a world may separate us, great ties unite us, ties that are economic and military, moral, and intellectual.
Your Majesty, the name you have chosen for your reign can be translated as ""achieving peace."" That choice signifies your deep personal commitment to this noble aspiration and your resolve not to revisit the tragedies of the past. We are now closer to achieving the blessings of peace than we have been at any time in this century.
When the great Japanese novelist Kawabata received the Nobel Prize in literature, the citation praised him for ""building a spiritual bridge spanning East and West."" In this changing world where the walls that once divided whole nations from each other are crumbling, we all must become both bridges to and partners in a new world order.
In that spirit and with heartfelt thanks, Your Majesty, for your wonderful hospitality, I ask all of your guests to raise their glasses. To your health, sir, and to the bridge of friendship and common purpose uniting our countries, to those who built it and cross it still, and to the prosperity of our two great peoples.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"April 17, 1985","
President Reagan. Mr. President, Madame Bendjedid, distinguished guests: Welcome to the White House. It's our pleasure to have as our guests friends from a distant land. And today we've worked and, I might add, succeeded in bringing our nations and the leaders of our nations closer together.
Mr. President, we're proud that the United States was among the first to recognize Algeria's independence in 1962. In the years which have passed since that time, we've not always seen political issues in the same light, but total agreement is not the basis of friendship; instead it's based on respect and forthrightness. And if this be the case, Algerians and Americans should and ought to be friends.
I enjoyed our conversations today, Mr. President. They were productive, and the spirit was positive. These talks have reinforced the ties between our two governments and our peoples. In the course of our discussions, we covered a wide area—trade and economic planning, humanitarian efforts in Africa, and cultural exchanges. And I believe that the steps forward we made will be followed by many more. And we look forward to that progress.
After getting to know you, Mr. President, I'm certain you agree that nothing would better serve the joint interests of our peoples than peace and stability in the Middle East. We're aware of your particular concerns, ties, and friendships in the region, as you're aware of ours. Let us, Mr. President, use our influence toward positive ends. Let us urge our friends toward peaceful resolution of disputes. Let us encourage them to build and to create and to do those things that make for a better life.
Americans have had a challenging Middle Eastern role for almost four decades. We've done our best to create new opportunities for peace. And we'll continue our efforts, but peace depends on all those of good will in the region, on all sides of the conflict, taking the initiative.
For our part, we continue to believe Middle East peace must emerge from direct negotiations between the parties based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 242. As you so eloquently have noted, a solution to this complex problem must address the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and provide security for all in the region, including Israel.
Algeria lies at the northern edge of a continent beset by drought and famine. Mr. President, we applaud your government's humanitarian efforts to help your less fortunate neighbors, both by donating funds to supplement food and shelter for the people of the Sahel and by accepting and caring for thousands of refugees from the famine. Algeria has been a leader in African self-help efforts in this crisis and a shining example to others.
President and Madame Bendjedid, your visit to the United States is a new high point in Algerian and American relations, and we're honored to have you here. I'm happy to have the opportunity to get to know you as a leader of a great people and as a man of vision and strength.
To His Excellency, the President of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, and Mrs. Bendjedid. And we thank you.
President Bendjedid. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate your kind words to me and in speaking of the Algerian people. I take great pleasure in expressing to you and through you to the American people, the sentiments of respect and friendship felt for you by the Algerian people.
Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, in this hospitable city that carries the prestigious name of one of the Founding Fathers of your great nation, allow me to evoke the deep historical roots of the relationship between our two countries, illustrated by the treaty of peace and friendship signed on the 5th of September 1795.
It equally pleases me to point out the similarity between the resistance of our two peoples to colonial occupation. Perhaps the best testimony to that is the foundation in 1846 of the city of Elkader—or in Arabic, [different pronunciation] Elkader—in the State of Iowa in memory of the Amir Abdel Kader Al Jaza'iri and of the Algerian national resistance. There is certainly in that symbol that our two people share the ideals of liberty and independence, as confirmed during our struggle for national independence.
It is thanks to your invitation, Mr. President, that I am here with you today at this important time in the development of our relations. I took personal pleasure in meeting you at Cancun. I also learned from Vice President Bush during his visit to Algeria the personal interest that you attach to a dialog between our two countries. It is indeed satisfying to observe that under your Presidency, exchanges between our two countries have been greatly reinforced and that many members of your Cabinet have contributed to that process.
Mr. President, beyond existing trade relations there is, in the development of our national economy, considerable potential for multifaceted cooperation between our countries. The genius of the American people has enabled man to conquer nature. Algeria aspires to enter an era of scientific and technical progress that will lead to the acquisition and mastery of advanced technology in various fields in order to spur our national development. This is another field for fruitful cooperation. On the whole, cooperation between our two countries has produced appreciable results. The expansion of these ties is both possible and desirable.
Confronted with the demands of peace, security, and development, nations known for their power and prosperity should make an even more substantial contribution. But whether the matter concerns reversal of the arms race, disarmament, or improving international political atmosphere through crises reduction and the elimination of tensions, or establishing more equitable economic relations and eradicating world hunger, the challenge is to create a better world for all.
The course of nonalignment, which inspires and guides the international policies of Algeria, seeks to promote harmony between all peoples, whatever the path they have chosen. The African Continent has witnessed the cumulative anguish of institutionalized racism, of desertification, of drought, and of famine. A universal outcry is necessary to achieve the dismantling of apartheid, the achievement of Namibian independence, and bring peace in southern Africa.
In the Middle East, it is Algeria's conviction that the Palestinian problem is at the heart of the crisis in that region. Therefore, Mr. President, recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people is the only path to a just and durable peace in that region.
In the Maghreb, Algeria will never cease to work in the interest of regional stability. An effort must be made to find a negotiated solution based on an African and international consensus over the question of the Western Sahara.
In regard to the conflict between Iraq and Iran, Algeria will spare no efforts to achieve a reasonable peace and good relations between these two neighbors.
Mr. President, the dialog that we profoundly desire between Algeria and the United States is nourished by the need for greater understanding, agreement, and cooperation between nations.
In thanking you once again, Mr. President, for your kind invitation and for your courtesies to me and my delegation during our stay, I would like to propose a toast to friendship between the American and Algerian peoples; to understanding, agreement, and universal cooperation; to the health of Mrs. Reagan and yourself; to the health of Mrs. Bush and Vice President Bush; to the health of all the friends gathered here this evening.
And thank you very much.

Chancellor Kreisky, President Sadat, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen:
In the few hours that Mrs. Ford and I have been here, we have been struck by the remarkable charm and the character of Salzburg. And we thank our hosts in this area for their warmth and the friendship that they have shown us.
Austria and the United States have enjoyed warm and 'friendly ties over a long span of time. Our relationship during the postwar period has been especially close and mutually sustaining.
We value Austria's important role in the search for order and stability in the world, for its contributions in the Middle East, in Cyprus, and elsewhere, in the effort to preserve peace and work toward the negotiated resolution of international conflicts.
When I arrived this morning, I spoke of the reestablishment of a sovereign Austria, the 20th anniversary of which was celebrated just a few weeks ago. The State Treaty and subsequent rebuilding of Austria has served as a landmark for the postwar history.
This landmark demonstrates the possibility of achieving stability and security through negotiation and strict adherence to the principles of democratic self-determination and national sovereignty.
The conciliation demonstrated by all sides helped to produce the vigorous, dynamic, and prosperous Austria that we see today. It contributed to a stable, regional political environment. This experience proves a useful lesson in the search for peace in other regions.
I am particularly grateful to your government and to you, Mr. Chancellor, for providing these hospitable surroundings for the meetings with President Sadat.
In our talks today, we have had a welcome opportunity to review the recent positive trends and relations between the United States and Egypt. We have also begun a very useful review of developments in the Middle East, and the exchange of views has been extremely helpful. It is my fervent hope that our talks will contribute to a settlement in the Middle East.
Mr. Chancellor, I raise my glass to Austria and to the objectives that we seek and to you and to world peace.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"July 27, 1969","
Mr. President, Mrs. Suharto, all of these very distinguished guests this evening:
I first wish to express on behalf of those who are your guests from the United States our grateful appreciation for this beautiful dinner and also for the kind remarks that you have just made about our country, and particularly about our astronauts whose great feat, as I mentioned earlier today, we considered as one that was beyond the achievement of a nation, but which belonged to all mankind.
Also, on this occasion I realize that the position that I am in is a unique one-one that will not come again--because since I am the first American President ever to pay a state visit to Indonesia, the next American President who comes here will not be in the position I presently find myself in.
Consequently, I would like to respond to your very gracious remarks by trying to relate our policy as I understand it to the hopes and desires of your great people.
You have spoken very properly of the fact that we in many ways have similarities in background; the fact that we both were once colonies and had revolutions.
Ours is older than yours by almost 200 years, but we went through many of the same problems that your nation has gone through and is going through today. And because we are a nation that has an immense interest in all the developments in the world, we have followed what has happened in Indonesia. We have followed it because this is one of the major countries of the world. What happens here, the future of the 115 million people of Indonesia, will have an enormous effect on the future of peace in the Pacific and, therefore, on peace in the world.
We, therefore, are interested in Indonesia for that reason, but we are also interested in Indonesia for another one, because those of us who have had the privilege--a privilege that I have had---of visiting this country, of knowing your people, realize how rich this country is in its resources and, more important, how rich it is in its people.
Today, again, we were reminded of that wealth as we visited the Djakarta Fair. We saw many, many people. But we saw represented there, too, all of the country, the customs and the culture of the past, and the diversity of this country which gives it such wealth.
But we saw also the plans for the future--the exciting 5-year plan which your Government has initiated.
As I thought of those things, the past and the plans for the future, I realized that our country is privileged to play a part with you in helping to achieve those plans, those ideals, and those goals. I say privileged, because sometimes we think of the assistance that we provide to other countries as being a burden. I do not consider it that way.
As I see it, only when it is mutually helpful to us both is such assistance something that either of us would want.
As I consider Indonesia and all that it means to peace in the Pacific and in the world, as I consider the possibilities for progress in this country in the years ahead---possibilities that probably are as exciting as for any nation in the world today--then I realize that the United States of America should welcome the role of being of some assistance in achieving that goal.
Let me be also quite precise in another respect.
You referred in your remarks to the fact that when our astronaut first set foot on the moon that he uttered the historic words that it was: ""... one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."" And so it was.
But you also very appropriately referred to the fact that here on earth too often the steps for mankind are very, very small, if at all.
That is why, as we consider your country, all the countries of Asia that I will visit, we will be thinking of how those steps can be larger; how they can become, finally, a giant leap for mankind on earth at a time that we have made a giant leap for mankind in expanding his knowledge beyond the earth--toward the heavens.
I would like to say in this connection that we have admired, Mr. President, your policies--admired them because, as we study 'the history of nations, it can truly be said that while a revolution is very difficult--difficult and costly in men, in treasure, and in lives--that many times the more difficult part of a nation's development is what comes after a revolution: that hard, daily drudgery of building again after the revolution has necessarily destroyed some of the institutions of the past.
So we see you engaging in that task, you and your colleagues represented in this room today. We saw evidences of it at the fair, and your 5-year plan.
I have seen it quite precisely in an issue that we are trying to deal with in the United States. I noted that 3 years ago Indonesia had one of the highest rates of inflation in the whole world, and today it is one of the lowest.
If you would tell us the secret, that would be very helpful for me to take back to the United States.
But as we look at that achievement, as we look at the stability, the strength, the political stability, the economic stability, that you have provided to this country during the time that you have been present-you and your colleagues--we have confidence that Indonesia now is ready to move forward--move forward not with just small steps, but bigger and bigger steps, so that in the end it will mean a giant leap forward.
We want to be with you. We want to assist you in any way that you think is appropriate--we along with other nations who have the capacity to do so.
For that reason, it is a very great privilege for me to return to this country for the third time, to return in an official capacity as President of my country, and to reaffirm the ties of friendship which sometimes, as you have indicated, have been strained, but which, fortunately, today are very, very strong.
If there is one goal that the administration, which I now heard in Washington, will have, it will be to see that the ties of friendship, and cooperation, and mutual trust and assistance between Indonesia and America will be stronger and stronger, because this is in our interest as well as in yours. It is in both of our interests because what happens here, as I have indicated earlier, may well determine whether peace and independence survive in the Pacific and, therefore, in the world.
And so I ask all of you to join me in raising your glasses to the President and Mrs. Suharto, and to the great Indonesian people, to their prosperity, their progress, their independence, and the peace that we will all enjoy.

state-dinners,George Bush,"June 16, 1992","
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House. Mr. President and Mrs. Yeltsin, and distinguished guests all, Barbara and I are delighted to welcome you here tonight on a day that I think history will record as something very, very special. I am very pleased with the arrangements that we were able to work out with President Yeltsin today. I think it's good for mankind. I think it's good for the generations here and the generations to come. So you're here on an historic occasion, and we couldn't be more pleased.
Mr. President, tonight's dinner is a little bit more formal than the blue jeans and sweaters that we wore back up there at Camp David in February, but I believe the progress we made today would not have been possible without that private time we spent together and then without the hard work of our Secretary and your Foreign Minister, our Secretary of Defense, your Defense Minister, our Ambassador, your Ambassador. As I said this morning as I welcomed you to the White House, this meeting marks a new kind of summit, not a meeting between two powers that are struggling for global supremacy but between two partners striving to build a democratic peace.
This new relationship has its roots in the new Russian revolution, and that revolution owes so much to our guest here tonight. Just as crises show the mettle of a man, so too they show the strength of an idea. When, back in August of 1991, the old guard threatened to take Russia backward, Boris Yeltsin led the defense of democracy from the building the Russians call the White House. The coup plotters set out to destroy democracy, and instead, thanks to the courage of this man, they made it stronger.
Mr. President, you've been described many times as a maverick, a word coined in the American heartland to capture the independent streak that sets some individuals apart from the crowd. Well, I think our fellow Texans Jim Baker and Bob Strauss would agree you possess a certain spirit that you find on the plains of the West. And tonight we honor your courage and celebrate the new possibilities now open to us.
Think back to the cold war climate that marked earlier summits and how far we've come. How much safer, how much more hopeful to meet tonight as friends united by common ideals. More than 150 years ago de Tocqueville predicted that the United States and Russia would one day be the world's two great powers, rivals for world dominance. We must prove that prophecy was only true for a time and that our two nations can forge a new future in freedom.
Our governments will work to build stronger ties for the sake of peace and prosperity. We in this country must reach out, provide the assistance that can help Russia's democratic revolution succeed.
But the bonds that knit democracies together can never be created by government alone. Democracies grow together through the countless encounters that take place every day between private individuals -- professionals, business and labor, artists and educators -- in your country and ours. Gone are the days when vast parts of our countries were off-limits to foreign visitors. Under our new open lands agreement, for the first time Russian and American officials, and more important, Russian and American citizens, will be free to travel anywhere in each other's country to witness the customs and heritage that set us apart and the common humanity that draws us together.
So tonight, Mr. President, I offer this toast in the spirit of friendship to the new partnership between our people, to the success of the new Russian revolution, and to the health and happiness of Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"April 16, 1998","
Mr. President, Mrs. Frei, members of the Chilean Government, citizens of this great nation: On behalf of my wife, our administration, the Members of Congress and our entire party, I thank you for the warm welcome we have received. And I understand that I should thank you in advance for your patience because the great gathering of this coming week will probably create the biggest taco in your history. [Laughter] For those in our delegation who don't know, that means ""traffic jam.""
Mr. President, it was just over a year ago that Hillary and I hosted you and Martita for a state visit in Washington. On that trip you delivered a powerful address to a joint session of our Congress. Now I will have the opportunity and the honor of addressing your Parliament tomorrow.
The short time between our visits reflects the growing strength and the growing importance of our relations. Chile is admired in the United States and around the world for its natural beauty, its writers and artists, its athletes, its leadership in seeking peace in volatile regions, its remarkable economic growth and stability, and the bravery of your people in restoring longstanding democracy after two turbulent decades.
That Chile is host to the second Summit of the Americas shows the esteem in which your country is held in this hemisphere. It also demonstrates, Mr. President, the great respect you have earned among your fellow leaders who are proud to be coming here for this meeting.
Some see you, Mr. President, as a man of calm reserve; a civil engineer who, as you just said, expertly builds bridges to improve the lives of your fellow citizens. But it seems to me there may be another side to you. It is said that you love opera and the tango—hardly the stuff of dry engineering. [Laughter] And when you addressed our Congress last year, the first person you quoted was not some gray-suited economist but that great political leader Don Quixote de la Mancha. The words of the noble Don you selected go to the core of our shared values, so let me repeat them tonight: ""Freedom is one of the most precious gifts Heaven bestows on man. All the treasure of Earth cannot equal it.""
Mr. President, we have seen that like your father before you, you care passionately about the freedom of your people and about the least fortunate in your society. I'm sure your father was in your thoughts when, in your very first address as Chile's President, you pledged to bring hope and dignity to the poorest of your fellow citizens. You've worked hard to ensure that your growing prosperity will benefit not just the few but everyone. And Mrs. Frei deserves great credit for her active work on behalf of the poor, women and children, and Chilean artisans.
The United States wants to deepen our partnership with Chile across the whole range of challenges and opportunities we share, strengthening democracy, improving education, protecting the environment, preserving the peace, and yes, expanding trade. Our meeting today furthered all these goals. I know we will continue to do the same. So much is at stake. Working with the Chilean people and with you, Mr. President, is a great honor for me, my Government, and our citizens.
In the darkest days of the past year, when dissent was suppressed, when people were denied a meaningful vote and true leaders denied the chance to lead, the Chilean people never abandoned hope that one day things would get better. Now, because of your hope, the courage, the vision of your leadership, and your people, things are, indeed, better—much better. Better in a way that is a beacon of hope to people throughout this hemisphere, and, indeed—perhaps more than you know—throughout the world.
Now the United States and Chile celebrate together the precious gifts of freedom and prosperity, and our determination to support democracy and to advance prosperity all across the Americas and throughout the world.
For all that you have done and the reception we have received, and for all that we must do together for tomorrow, I am honored to invite all of you to join me in a toast to the President, the First Lady, and the people of Chile.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"November 10, 1987","
President Reagan. Well, what a pleasure it is for Nancy and me and all our distinguished guests to have the President of Israel and his lovely wife with us at this festive dinner. It's a special occasion for us to have you with us, Mr. President, because of your personal distinction and because you represent Israel, one of our closest friends and partners.
Moreover, Mr. President, your visit has special significance for yet another reason: It's a great day for the Irish! [Laughter] I can't help but note that Ireland is so successful at producing national leaders and that an Irish brogue carries as much influence in Jerusalem as it does here. [Laughter]
That you were born in Ireland and that my ancestors came from there may seem accidental, but it speaks to the history of both Israel and the United States. Ours are nations of immigrants and nations of opportunity. Israel was established with an open door to the Jewish people from around the globe. The epic drama of the ingathering of those who came to Israel to find freedom, escape persecution, and rebuild their lives has captured the imagination of all Americans. We, too, come from distant shores, and in different circumstances struggled for our own freedom.
Israel has never lost sight of its destiny to be a nation of free people living by the principles of democracy. Israel's vibrant democracy offers the best and strongest rejoinder to those who denigrate its achievements or who try to equate Zionism with racism, as the U.N. General Assembly did in 1975. In that connection, I welcome recent action by the Congress calling for the overturning of the U.N. General Assembly's misguided and reprehensible resolution.
Over the last four decades, Israel has grown and prospered. Your farmers and pioneers have made the land green. Your universities and research institutes have created miracles of technology and science that have added to human welfare. And your people have set the world an example in courage and fortitude.
In these 40 years, we Americans have been proud of our friendship and partnership with Israel. Few nations enjoy richer or stronger ties. Support for Israel is not limited to one group or region; it is felt and expressed throughout the United States. It reflects genuine affection, admiration, and mutual respect.
Since Harry Truman extended diplomatic recognition to Israel, every American President has cared deeply about Israel's security and its quest for peace. I carry on that tradition, and I renew tonight the pledge I've made before: The United States will always ensure Israel's security and work with her in partnership for peace.
Mr. President, Nancy and I extend our best wishes to you and Mrs. Herzog and the people of Israel, for health and prosperity and for the continued close friendship between our two great countries and peoples: L'Chaim! [To life.]
President Herzog. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, I rise to thank Mrs. Reagan and yourself for the kind hospitality extended by you to Aura and myself on this historic occasion, the first state visit of the President of Israel to the United States of America.
It is very difficult, well nigh impossible, to give adequate expression to what one feels on such a moving occasion. Not even something you and I have in common can help to overcome this difficulty. I'm referring, of course, to the fact that somewhere in our personalities we have a common advantage over many others: that of the gift acquired from the Blarney Stone. [Laughter]
Despite the enormous differences between our two countries, as we celebrate our 40th anniversary, one cannot but remark on many similarities. When the director of our railroads first visited the United States, he was asked by his hosts how many miles of railroad we had. Too embarrassed to tell the truth, he replied that he could not recall the distance, but he knew that we had the same width as in the United States. [Laughter]
The common foundations which both our countries have based on the teachings of the Hebrew Bible have been used to build a superstructure of relationships which is really quite special. I do not know whether history has another example of a great, free democracy extending so broad a hand of friendship to a young, although also very old, state so far from its borders and so different from it in size of population and area. Indeed, our partnership led to the fact that in this building was signed the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. It was a truly unique occasion in the history of peace. It signified the first great achievement of the peace process, which we and, I believe, the vast majority of the peoples in the adjacent Arab States pray will lead to a lasting peace to the Middle East.
America's support for Israel, a free, open, democratic society in which the dignity of man is enshrined as a supreme value, has been a pillar of American policy, a commitment of all American Presidents, a consensus uniting the American political spectrum, and a reflection of the will of the American people. You, Mr. President, have brought our relationship to unprecedented heights, to a closeness that is symbolized by this evening. Mark Twain once said: ""Always do right. This will gratify some people, and astonish the rest."" [Laughter] Indeed, the main thing is to continue to do what we believe to be right, as you, Mr. President, are doing with your resolve and leadership in the Middle East and in the Persian Gulf.
It is always important to remember what it is that we represent: two peoples with a rich heritage and a message that the destiny of mankind is freedom, that the greatness of a nation is determined by its commitment to freedom, and that peace and international cooperation are the only parts to a secure future.
Mr. President, on behalf of the people of Israel, I thank you for your friendship and unfailing support. Your name is inscribed indelibly in our history as a dear and close friend who appreciates the importance for the free world of a strong and stable Israel, as an outpost committed to the defense of democracy in a region swept by the winds of fanaticism and fundamentalistic bigotry.
I ask you, Mr. President, to give us, the people of Israel, the opportunity to express to yourself and to Mrs. Reagan, who has a special place in the hearts of our people, our profoundest feelings for you both by coming to Israel and meeting a grateful nation and by seeing for yourselves the realization of an ancient peoples' dream. I would ask your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, please rise so that I may drink to the health of the President of the United States and Mrs. Reagan.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"May 15, 1984","
President Reagan. President and Mrs. De la Madrid, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, it's been our pleasure to have you as our guests this evening.
Being here with so many friends from Mexico, I can't help but take my thoughts back to California. Tonight is reminiscent of the gala evenings in old California, the vineyards, the music, the pride and accomplishments of the Hispanic frontier men and women, individuals who conquered a wilderness, but while doing so, maintained a phenomenal level of dignity. All of this, and more, reflects the character of a people whose legacy is now shared by the citizens of our two countries.
I'm not certain it goes back as far as the hacienda days, but I would like to extend to you a traditional greeting that I've adopted as my own, just as I adopted California. President and Mrs. De la Madrid, mi casa es su casa [my house is your house].
Today we've had frank and fulfilling discussions. Mr. President, I hope you agree with me that although we do not see eye to eye on everything, it is clear that we as individuals, and our two nations as well, remain solid in our friendship and undeterred in our trust.
The good will between us goes far beyond the transitory issues of the day. Our people recognize that issues, even those that seem important at the moment, will someday pass from the scene. What will not change are the many gifts and mandates given to us by God that serve as the basis of our societies. I can't believe that the Lord brought us to this level of political, social, and economic development, that He located us—the Mexican and American people-in such proximity and did not intend us to be friends.
In the last 50 years, when people of bordering countries in so many parts of the world were killing each other, or were immersed in envy and hatred, the mutual respect and ever-increasing cooperation between our peoples and governments shined in contrast.
Our trade and commerce is a powerful engine for economic progress for both our countries. The cultural and social ties between our people enrich and add diversity and flavor to our everyday lives. Yet the cement with the strongest grip is found in the ideals and values that our people share.
President Thomas Jefferson, a man so important to the development of human liberty, outlined in his first inaugural address some of the aspirations of our new republic. Although spoken 183 years ago, the words still ring true. Our desire in foreign affairs, he said, was ""equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations ....
I heard an echo of these sentiments last August in La Paz when you, Mr. President, said, ""Nationalism, cultural identity, freedom, democracy, economic development with social justice, an independent foreign policy, and defense of our territorial integrity are shared values embodied in our national design and vital bonds that link us all.""
Mr. President, if we can be guided by these principles with our shared values and interests overshadowing momentary disagreements, surely the good will between us will endure, and our relationship will continue to shine as an example to others.
And now will all of you join me in a toast to our honored guests—to President and Mrs. De la Madrid, to their health, and to the continued good will between our two great nations.
President De la Madrid. President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, may my first words be to express my gratitude for the kind courtesies that we have received during our visit to Washington today. Both during our work meetings and today, during this dinner, we have seen proofs of affectionate and cordial friendship that both my wife, myself, and the members of my party appreciate very much.
This kind of a dialog is also always fruitful. It makes it possible for us to compare our analysis and evaluation, our perceptions of reality, to agree on our similarities, and also to know our differences.
Geography has influenced both of us. It has led us to be neighbors, and it has led us to be friends. Neighbors we are because geography is as it is, but friends is something that comes from our own self. It is a quality of the human being.
Friends always seek to extend areas of consensus and to make their differences smaller, to seek formulas to overcome the problems that come from our close, complex, and very broad relationship. Friendship presupposes all of this. There must be sincerity and frankness, dignity and respect in our dealings, careful examination of our discrepancies and above all, it demands good will.
Differences of opinion are natural and can be explained among human beings. They can be explained among us. Even though Mexico and the United States have often traveled the same road, even though they stem from the same roots, there are differences in our culture, and these differences have made our sensibilities also different. It has come to enrich the human race, because it is variation which is needed for this enrichment. It is not good for everyone to be just the same.
In this way, Americans and Mexicans find themselves face to face with a rich culture and a rich and profound perception of our nationalities. But there are not only differences among us—or between us; analogies are also evident.
Both nations have rooted their political and social systems in the aspiration to live in freedom, to permanently build democracy, and to seek the equality of opportunity for all. Both nations postulate respect for law and justice as a norm for peaceful and dignified coexistence. And that which makes our two countries similar, Mr. President, is that we are not societies that are frozen and opposed to change. We are societies that are open to change.
We who love freedom must be open to change. We cannot freeze the human spirit. And it is for this reason that we are also obliged to be tolerant.
President Reagan, our conversations have been honorable and cordial. They reflect our common purpose: to extend the areas in which we agree and to reduce our differences. But the road to travel is a long one. The life of individuals has a limit, but the life of nations does not have a historical horizon.
The important thing about this meeting is that we have renewed our will to continue to travel that road as individuals and as nations that are living in good faith. As I said before, during the luncheon that was kindly offered me by Secretary Shultz, we know that you want to have dignified, prosperous, and strong neighbors.
It is very important that a powerful nation such as the United States, which is the most powerful nation of all, can say to the other countries, ""We have neighbors who are dignified; they are not slaves."" I, therefore, President Reagan, express my hope that this relationship with dignity and cordiality that has been built by the Americans and the Mexicans will always be the common denominator of our relationship, that we shall always be capable with talent and good will to continue to strengthen our friendship to our mutual benefit.
This is the thinking and the will of the Mexican people. And I am certain that there is this same thinking and this same will in the United States. That is why I express my wishes that the relations between Mexico and the United States will always be vigorous, that they may be strengthened by our will to understanding, and because friendship and cooperation is what will bring us together.
I wish to ask you to join me in a toast to the personal happiness of President Reagan and his charming wife, Nancy, to the happiness and prosperity of the American people, and to those values which we cherish, which are freedom, democracy, and justice.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"January 29, 1979","
THE PRESIDENT. Vice Premier Deng, Madame Zhuo Lin, distinguished visitors from the People's Republic of China, President Nixon, my fellow Americans, and friends:
This house belongs to all Americans, people who are firmly dedicated to a world of friendship and peace. And, Vice Premier Deng, on behalf of all Americans, I welcome you here to our house.
Your visit here, Mr. Vice Premier, is an important milestone in the development of friendly relations between the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. I'm gratified that after too many years of estrangement, that our two countries have now grasped the opportunity to reestablish these vital, formal links that exist between us.
In the past year, more than 120 delegations from the People's Republic of China have come here to the United States to visit us. And an even greater number of American groups have left here and gone to visit China. Exchanges have already begun in the natural sciences, in space, in agriculture, in medicine, in science, in technology, and other fields. And now with the establishment of normal diplomatic relations, the exploratory nature of these many exchanges can give way to a more valuable and a more permanent relationship. This will serve the interests of both our nations and will also serve the cause of peace.
Today, for the first time since the establishment of normal diplomatic relations, the Governments of the United States of America and the People's Republic of .China have begun official discussions at the highest level. Our discussions are fruitful and they are constructive, because both of us are keenly aware that what we do now will establish precedents for future peaceful relationships.
We've not entered this new relationship for any short-term gains. We have a longterm commitment to a world community of diverse nations and independent nations. We believe that a strong and a secure China will play a cooperative part in developing that type of world community which we envision. Our new relationship particularly can contribute to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.
Your nation, Vice Premier Deng, like ours, has been created by the hard work of ordinary men and women. Despite our cultural, political, and economic differences, there's much for us to build on together.
The United States, born out of a revolution for freedom, is a young country with an independent history of only 200 years. But our Constitution is the oldest continuing written constitution in the entire world.
Chinese civilization, with more than 4,000 years of recorded history, is one of the oldest cultures in the world. But as a modern nation, China is quite young. We can learn much from each other.
There are many hundreds of thousands of Americans of Chinese origin, and their contributions to our society have been even greater than their numbers could possibly suggest. Our national life has been enriched by the work of Chinese American architects, artists, and scientists-including three recent winners of the Nobel Prize.
Like you, Mr. Vice Premier, I'm a farmer, and like you, I'm a former military man. In my little farming community, when I grew up, our agricultural methods and our way of life were not greatly different from those of centuries earlier. I stepped from that world into the planning and outfitting of nuclear submarines. And when I later returned to the land, I found that farming had been absolutely transformed in just a few years by new scientific knowledge and by technology.
I know the shocks of change in my own life, and I know the sometimes painful adjustments required when change occurs, as well as the great potential for good that change can bring to both individuals and to nations.
I know, too, that neither individuals nor nations can stifle change. It is far better to adapt scientific and technological advantages to our needs, to learn to control them, and to reap their benefits while minimizing their potential adverse effects.
And I know that the Chinese people and you, Mr. Vice Premier, understand these things about change very well. Your ambitious modernization effort in four different areas of human life attests to that. The American people wish you well in these efforts, and we are looking forward to cooperating with you and with the people of China.
In his final message, the day before he died, Franklin Roosevelt—who would have been 97 years old tomorrow—wrote these words: ""If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships—the ability of people of all kinds to live together and to work together, in the same world and at peace.""
In that spirit, Mr. Vice Premier, I would like to propose a toast: To the newly established diplomatic relationships between the United States of America and the people of the republic of China; to the health of Premier Hua Guofeng; to the health of Vice Premier Deng and Madame Zhuo Lin; and to the further development of friendship between the people of China and the people of the United States of America.
THE VICE PREMIER. Mr. President and Mrs. Carter, ladies and gentlemen:
We thank the President and Mrs. Carter for hosting this grand dinner in our honor. Allow me to take this opportunity to extend good wishes to the American Government and the people on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, Premier Hua Guofeng, and in my own name.
Our arrival in the United States coincides with the Spring Festival in China. From time immemorial, the Chinese people have celebrated this festival marking ""the beginning of the annual cycle and rejuvenation of all things in nature."" Here, on this occasion, we share with our American friends present the feeling that a new era has begun in Sino-U.S. relations.
For 30 years, our two nations were estranged and opposed to each other. This abnormal state of affairs is over at last. At such a time we cherish, in particular, the memory of the late Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, who blazed a trail for the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations.
Naturally, we think also of the efforts made by former President Nixon, former President Ford, Dr. Kissinger, many U.S. Senators and Congressmen, and friends in all walks of life. We think highly of the valuable contributions of President Carter, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, and Dr. Brzezinski to the ultimate normalization of our relations.
Our two countries have different social systems and ideologies, but both Governments are aware that the interests of our peoples and of world peace require that we view our bilateral relations in the context of the overall international situation and with a long-term strategic perspective. This was the reason why the two sides easily reached agreement on normalization.
Moreover, in the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations our two sides solemnly committed themselves that neither should seek hegemony and each was opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony. This commitment restrains ourselves and adds to our sense of responsibility for world peace and stability. We are confident that the amicable cooperation between the Chinese and American peoples is not only in the interest of our two countries' development but will also become a strong factor working for the preservation of world peace and the promotion of human progress.
I ask you to join me in drinking to the health of the President and Mrs. Carter; to the health of the Secretary of State and Mrs. Vance; to the health of Dr. and Mrs. Brzezinski; to the health of all friends present; to the great American people; to the great Chinese people; to friendship between the Chinese and American peoples; and to the peace and progress of the people of the world.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"September 16, 1982","
President Reagan. Ladies and gentlemen-isn't that a shock when they turn on those lights? [Laughter]
Before I say what I was prepared to say here, I think that all of us ought to join in a ""Happy Birthday."" There is a period in which you can tell a lady's age— [laughter] —when it is Irene Marcos, and it's her 22d birthday. Happy birthday.
But tonight we welcome old and good friends to the White House in a visit symbolic of the superb relationship between our two countries. It's a nostalgic occasion for us, as well. Nancy and I often think of our 1969 visit to Manila, when we first experienced that unexcelled Philippine hospitality as the guests of our guests here tonight. And the birthday girl was quite young and small at that time.
Many things have changed in both countries since that time, but one thing remains constant—the basic nature of the Filipino-United States friendship. It remains solid. Both countries have worked hard over the years to maintain excellent cooperation in defense, foreign policy, refugee matters, economic assistance, and many other areas. And I pledge to you, President Marcos, that the United States will do its share to strengthen those ties in the 1930's—the 1980's! [Laughter] I have been doing a little reminiscing at the table, forgive me. Yes, the 1930's was my first job. [Laughter]
We value the friendship of the Republic of the Philippines for many reasons, Mr. President. Our intertwined histories during the first 50 years of this century left its imprint on your institutions of government, your educational system, and your public services, such as public health. The widespread use of the English language is a result of that era. So is your flourishing free enterprise system.
As important as our shared histories or our shared strategic interests which span this entire century, in World War II Filipinos and Americans fought and died together. And you, yourself, Mr. President, played an unforgettably heroic part in that conflict. Coming out of that war, your generation and mine fully understood the need for collective security arrangements. Unfortunately, some of today's young people, blessed by decades of relative peace, may not have this understanding. I think it's our duty to impart our historical experience to them.
Today, a strong defense alliance is a major factor in contributing to the security of the Philippines and to the maintenance of peace and security in Asia. With the next review of the military bases agreement, which begins in 1983, we shall continue to modernize our security relationship to best serve our mutual security interests.
Both of our economies depend on vigorous trade and investment. These ties remain strong, and your presence in Washington, Mr. President, has enabled us to conclude several outstanding economic matters.
President Marcos, we have accomplished a great deal together over the years. We will all do more in the years to come. Common determination to achieve a better life doesn't mean that we need to be alike, we need only to treat one another in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect. If we do that, our continuing commitment to one another, resting as it does on many years of close relations, will be solid now and for the future.
So, in that spirit, let me offer a toast: To the President and Mrs. Marcos, and to the people of the Philippines, and to the mutual respect, the dedication to peace and security in the world, and the shared values which unite us.
President Marcos. Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan, distinguished guests, my friends:
I feel I must pay tribute to this elegant and fairylike party and dinner which has reminded me too much not only of home but of some dreamland at home; a tribute to the taste and sense of beauty to—perhaps, primarily, not only to President Reagan but Mrs. Reagan for this lovely party, which I shall always remember as the Firefly Party in the White House. [Laughter]
You do us great honor with this dinner. Allow me to extend the gratitude of 50 million people in the Republic of the Philippines, Mrs. Marcos and myself, for this hospitality and this generosity. Certainly, we will be unable to reciprocate this beautiful event. You even had the songs all prepared, including a Filipino song that's a favorite of the First Lady of the Philippines, Dahil Sa Iya, which means ""Because of You"": because of you I love, because of you I live, and because of you I am what I am. And then you had the other theme song which was a favorite of both President Reagan and the other President, I understand, the theme song of Dr. Zhivago, which is a long story, of course, and which I won't talk about. [Laughter] It happens to be one of our theme songs because it was sung in one of what threatened to be a tragedy, but which did not, and that is why we remember it.
Tonight, the Philippines once again is obligated to you, Mr. President, for your kind and generous words. I note, too, the use of the word ""friendship,"" and I am reminded of the first President of the United States, the Father of this great nation, George Washington, who said that friendship is a slow, growing plant that must pass through the rigors of difficulty, hardship, before it can claim this appellation. And I am reminded, too, of the more—almost a century of relationship between our two countries and the periods of difficulty, the rigors, perhaps, even of misunderstanding, and battles that we have fought together. And perhaps, therefore, it is not too rash to say that it is proper to use the appellation ""friendship"" between the American and the Filipino.
That friendship—that abiding friendship—we cherish and cherish deeply. And this is why as I come and stand, once again, on American soil, Mr. President, I cannot but be candid. I would not be candid if I did not speak, too, of those misunderstandings and the adversities which we have faced together. For the world faces challenge and change. We are in a period of ferment. As one of your great writers has said: You have passed through a period of torment, an ordeal, perhaps, of tragedy, as you experienced the assassination of some of your American leaders, constitutional crisis in the Presidency, a trauma of Vietnam, and occasionally doubts about your own capability.
Certainly, as we look around in Asia the historic relation of the United States with the countries of that part of the world are marked occasionally with doubt, mutual distrust, and often there is fear that perhaps America is weary of the responsibility that it has for the world community. But the Philippines has always stood on the firm conviction that America does not weary, that America is firm and resolute, that America may question some of its own actions, but that it faces and confronts its problems squarely, fairly, justly.
As I stand on American soil and I see the doubts rising in Asia, I see another phenomenon that clears my mind. It is the phenomenon of an American nation led by a new leadership, earnestly exerting heroic efforts in order to stop the slide and the loss of prestige of American leadership throughout the world.
Yes, Mr. President, out of the dark, out of the shadows of the decline in even respect for America and decline for her leadership, there is a rising, an emerging, a new America-not only in Asia but perhaps throughout the world—an emerging, a new America under a new leader, resurgent, firm, strong, committed, and forthright. And that leader is President Ronald Reagan.
The stakes are high, Mr. President. The stakes for a strong and emergent America are high. All the nations pray for your success, even those who criticize you. For even the mercantile nations will reap reward from your success, but they will reap comfort. They will reap an additional car for a family, a more comfortable home, more sumptuous dinners.
But the stake of the poorer nations like mine are greater, Mr. President. Their stake is survival. The other option is death. And so for you we have nothing but prayers, as I said this morning. And so we look towards this phenomenon and say: Let there be strength and greatness for the American nation, for only then can there be hope for us, the poorer nations. And let America reclaim her role, her historic place, and her historic relationship with the poorer nations of the world—the members of the Third World, my world. For that is your rightful place, Mr. President, and America.
So, once again, I say we pray, therefore, that God grant to America this strength and capability to reclaim her natural place and historic relationship with all the nations and with other nations reestablish order in our anxious, troubled world. We pray for this, we hope for this—not only the big nations but especially the small ones.
And so may I ask you to rise and join me to a toast: To the continued health and success of the President of the United States, the prosperity and the strength of the American people, and the friendship of the peoples of the United States and the Philippines.

Mr. President, Prime Minister, distinguished guests, this has been a day of extraordinary hospitality, insight, and discovery for us. On behalf of the American delegation, I thank you for all you have done to make us feel at home.
For 5 years now, my wife and daughter have been singing the glories of Bangladesh. Finally, I am glad to see for myself. This day has been a watershed for both our nations. Americans admire Bangladesh as a proud Muslim nation, devoted to peace with its neighbors, to peacekeeping around the world, to tolerance and diversity within its borders.
When the great Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, he said this: ""I am glad I have done some work to give expression to this great age when the East and the West are coming together."" Although he did not live to see the creation of Bangladesh, Tagore would doubtless be proud of all you have done to lead your people into a new century. I believe he would also approve of what we did today to bring the East and the West closer together.
I was deeply gratified this morning to be the first American President to arrive in Bangladesh, and I am proud of the kind of partnership we are forging. It is about more than the ceremony of a state visit. It is about promoting democracy and the values that give meaning to our lives. It is about helping children stay in school and have a better future, about investing in people who have never been given a chance to succeed before, and investing in a nation that now has a chance to succeed as never before.
Tomorrow the Sun will rise on a deeper friendship between America and Bangladesh. Through our ceremonies and our conversations, we have hastened the arrival of a more peaceful new day, the kind of day that Tagore spent his life imagining, a new day comprehending not only the absence of war and suffering but the presence of mutual understanding and common endeavors.
On behalf of all Americans, I pledge that we will work with you to build on this good day, to soften the hard facts of daily hardship, to make real the poetry of our finest aspirations.
I ask you now to join me in a toast to the President, the Prime Minister, the people of Bangladesh, and the friendship between our two nations. May it grow. May it deepen. May it affect the lives of our people in ways that are truly good.
Thank you very much.

Your Majesties, Prime Minister and Mrs. Rabin, all our distinguished guests: Welcome to the White House. Today we have seen history in the making. And tonight we celebrate this marvelous occasion with King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin and to all of you who for so long have supported their efforts for peace.
It's a special pleasure for Hillary and for me to welcome Queen Noor and Mrs. Rabin who, in their devotion to the health and the wellbeing of the children of their nations, prove that the quest for peace is not the only cause that knows no borders.
Today's signing of the Washington Declaration is the handiwork of many. But it is safe to say we would not be here tonight were it not for the persistent and far-sighted efforts of Crown Prince Hassan, Foreign Minister Peres, and our Secretary of State, Warren Christopher. I want to express my special gratitude to Secretary Christopher, who has brought such great energy and devotion to this task, and to applaud all three gentlemen for their efforts.
The Washington Declaration is a blueprint, both inspiring and practical, a foundation for lasting peace between two peoples who have been divided for too long. It is also clearly a personal tribute to two brave leaders, both called upon at a young age to shoulder enormous responsibilities, one to be a king, the other a defender of his people, brought together now at long last in the common cause of peace.
King Hussein, tonight we recall again the legacy of your grandfather and mentor, King Abdullah, a man who dreamed that one day, on both sides of the River Jordan, Arab and Jew could live together in peace and who lost his life for that dream of peace. At the age of 17, when most of us were still in school, you were left to shoulder the great weight of leading your people.
In the 42 years that have passed, you have led your kingdom through the stormy waters of the Middle East. You have improved the lives of your people and endowed your nation with a spirit of tolerance, civility, and compromise. You've built bridges between the Arab world and the United States through your actions as an advocate for stability and through your marriage to the Queen, herself a daughter of Americans who came from the Arab world. For that, we, sir, are in your debt.
And today you have moved to erase the divisions between the people of the two sides of the River Jordan. Tonight it can truly be said that you have fulfilled the legacy of King Abdullah.
Mr. Prime Minister, tonight we honor you, a son of the land of Israel. Your parents, Nehemia and Rosa, were among the first pioneers who came to Palestine. And like so many others of their generation, they devoted their lives to building a national home for the Jewish people.
Schooled in the science of agriculture, you once planned to devote your life to making the fields and deserts of Israel come alive. But at the age of 19, you answered the call to join the Palmach, destined to spend your life fighting to establish and defend the nation of Israel.
Now, after a life consumed by a war, you have become the architect of a great peace, building a homeland your parents could only imagine, a peaceful, prosperous land at harmony with its neighbors, a land where a new generation will be free to cast aside its weapons and fulfill your dream to make the valleys and deserts bloom. Tonight we honor you and the fulfillment of your legacy, sir.
These two men have crossed much hostile territory so that their children and their children's children need fight no more. They have earned this peace, and we are all in their debt.
And so, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and join me in a toast to these men of courage, to their fine families, to the peoples of Jordan and Israel, and to the promise of peace.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"January 02, 1978","
PRESIDENT REDDY. We are happy to have you with us this evening. My people associate America as a land of liberty, and they look upon you, Mr. President, as a leader who has sought to restore the relevance of moral and spiritual values.
The year just ended will long be remembered in the annals of our two nations. The people of the United States of America elected you to the White House to heal the wounds of a decade of conflicts and divisions. In India, our general elections gave proof that in a democracy the will of the people is the ultimate arbiter of power. Your visit provides the opportunity to establish closer personal contacts between the newly elected and like-minded leaders of our two countries and to strengthen the deep affinities between us. I welcome you on behalf of my people and my government.
Notwithstanding the ideals which we share, we have varied emphasis in our priorities and in our international preoccupations. Paradoxically, the very adherence to similar political systems has at times exaggerated our misunderstandings and blurred our affinities.
The world situation as it appears has materially changed. Many new countries have attained independent nationhood. Detente, coexistence, and even cooperation between countries with different political and social systems have come to be recognized as having an inexorable logic for our interdependent planet. Ideologies are in the process of being domesticated, and pluralism amongst nations is seen as a factor of stability, rather than a threat to international peace. The prospect of nuclear war has given a new meaning to the search for peace on Earth. Nonalignment is much less misunderstood. If there is a bipolarity today, it is between forces seeking stability and cooperation and those which seek to obstruct orderly and progressive solutions to world problems.
The growing chasm between the developing and developed world may in the future lead to increasing, dangerous tensions. The world of the rich and the poor face a common doom if we cannot act together to protect the earth, the air, and water from plunder and pollution.
What we have admired in the short period of your Presidency is your sensitivity not just to the problems of your own country but to the dark shadows on peace and international stability. You have made the international community aware of the rights of individuals, be they at home or in other distant lands, and the responsibilities we have to uphold of the common man's inherent demand for liberty, equality, and justice.
Mr. President, the world today commands the resources, the technology, and also, I believe, the wisdom to fashion a stabler and just international order. The time has come for the United States and India, along with like-minded countries, to work together so that overriding, narrow national interests may be persuaded to see the wisdom of making necessary adjustments and sacrifices to help establish a new international economic order. The dangerous imbalances which exist must be corrected, the specter of poverty removed, and the creeping despondency in cooperative solutions banished.
Mr. President, we recognize that the role we in India can play in the resolution of international problems can only come from dynamic economic growth and the establishment of an equitable society in our own land. Our people have demonstrated the capacity to learn and to innovate, but to fulfill their modest expectations is, in itself, a gigantic task. Our achievements, however, give us courage and confidence.
We have laid the foundations for our progress on a wide front covering principally agriculture, industry, and more important, the indigenization of scientific and technological know-how. Our economy has been relieved of the endemic anxieties arising from the paucity of food production and difficulties in balance of payments. We are in the process of reviewing our priorities so that a greater share of the benefits of planned socio-economic development reach the economically weaker sections of society. We have recognized the dangers from uncontrolled urbanization and are determined to make our villages economically resilient.
Social and economic transformation through democratic methods may at times appear slow. Certainly in a democratic setup, failure attracts more attention, both at home and abroad, than progress actually made towards social and economic goals. We seek neither to minimize our tasks nor conceal our failures. We are fully convinced that, in the end, a democracy gathers vigor from open dissent, and a consensus makes for firmer foundations. What we ask of the international community, and that too as a supplement to our own national efforts, is constructive cooperation or at least a benign understanding of our endeavors.
On the wider canvas, my government remains faithful to the fundamental principles of our foreign policy. The remnants of colonialism and racialism, where they still exist, must go. Racialism, which certainly persists in Africa in defiance of international opinion, must give way to governments representative of the majority.
We believe this is no time for increasing but, rather, arresting and eliminating great power deployment in the hitherto tension-free areas such as the Indian Ocean.
We welcome the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitations of strategic weapons and efforts to consolidate detente.
Faithful to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, India will always be on the side of the peaceful resolution of international disputes. We are determined to be true to the friendships which have served our national interests. We are equally convinced that in keeping with contemporary realities, we can widen and intensify our relations, to mutual advantage, with many countries.
In the final instance, peace will remain fragile if nuclear weapons, capable of such annihilative destruction, are kept and multiplied. We appreciate the concern and sincerity which you have expressed at these dangers and the efforts you are making to arrest the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
For our part, we have unilaterally abjured the development of such means of mass destruction. But, Mr. President, we hope that you will agree with the dangers of nuclear war, by accident or design, will remain, until such time as all nations, without arbitrary distinctions, join in a firm commitment for the progressive reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons from all parts of the world. The challenge demands not just restraints from nuclear weapons but pledges by the nuclear ""haves"" to turn away from the use of this instrument of modern science for military purposes. But, in the meanwhile, must countries who have no nuclear weapons be inhibited from using nuclear science as an instrument for economic transformation? I would like to emphasize with a full sense of responsibility that India, for her part, will not indulge in the perverse use of nuclear science.
Mr. President, our bilateral cooperation has been rich in range and content. My government acknowledges the debt of gratitude we owe to the United States, which has provided us generous aid when we were in need. Your assistance has been an important factor in our development and in the progress towards the diversification of our economy.
Of all the many-sided links between us, I would particularly like to recall that students and technologists trained in American institutions have, on return, grafted their acquired knowledge and skills to our national development.
Multifaceted and beneficial as has been our bilateral relationship, the range and sophistication has a wide scope for further development. It is for these reasons that we believe that the Indo-U.S. Joint Commission and its three subcommissions merit fuller encouragement and support.
The real cement of our relations goes beyond politics, economics, and technology. It is in the values and emotional involvement of our people. Both for Americans and India, man's communion with God, tolerance and compassion towards his fellow beings are respected as the highest virtues.
The present revulsion from the tensions of modern life and its unending search for material comforts has, we notice, led to a new burst of interest in our spiritual and philosophic heritage.
On another plane, many volunteers-like your esteemed mother—have built bonds of kinship between individuals and families across the oceans. This deep commitment to things of the mind and spirit, the sustained exchanges in the field of art, education, and culture, along with personal relationships, make for strong but invisible bonds which are only possible between open societies.
Mr. President, the rich texture of our relationship should make it immune to misunderstanding and distrust in the future. The quality of our friendship is such that no nation which cherishes international peace and cooperation need fear its potential and suspect it of malevolence.
With shared faith and complementary objectives, Mr. President, the word could go forth from this ancient capital that the friendship between our two large democracies, one rich and powerful and the other underdeveloped but resurgent, is to serve the hopes and aspirations of all mankind and that our objectives are not only relevant now but will remain valid through time.
Our vision must be of a world which would safeguard nations in their diversity and where man may achieve social justice, dignity, and fulfillment.
It is with a sense of historic significance on this occasion that I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to raise your glasses to the health of the President of the United States of America and Mrs. Carter, to the high ideas and enlightened interests which bind India and the United States. To your health.
PRESIDENT CARTER. President Reddy and Prime Minister Desai, great leaders of the government of India, beautiful women and friends who have made our visit here so enjoyable and productive:
This afternoon in your Parliament I spelled out in quite a lengthy speech the details about relationships which we have as a mutual interest. So, this evening in my brief remarks I would like to comment in a more personal way.
Today was fulfilled in my life a long ambition to visit the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi. As I stood there I thought about India and about my own country and about the personal feelings that all of us share as we come to an ancient land which in recent years, with the birth of your hopes and dreams for freedom, has been an inspiration to us all.
This morning your Prime Minister gave me a book that he had written analyzing the Bhagavad-Gita. One passage from that great book stood out in my mind. I can't quote it exactly, Mr. Prime Minister, and I can't interpret it well, but it said when a country is flooded, the reservoirs become superfluous. Sri Krishna went on to explain what he meant in this message, that when one's heart is filled completely with an awareness of our love for God, the other considerations in life are incidental. And one need not worry about the outcome of an action, but should worry on a momentary basis about the purposes and the attitudes and one's relation to the eternal.
There is no way to describe in overall terms my feeling about India. So I will have to describe my thoughts in specifics.
My first impression on leaving Air Force One, my plane, was the extreme friendship exhibited to me by the leaders who are assembled at this table. It was a remarkable expression of deference and respect on your part for the country I represent. When all your ministers, many of the members of your Parliament, and the diplomatic corps came to meet us, and the beautiful words that you expressed, Mr. President, to me then, will always be cherished in my heart.
On the drive into the city from the airport, the overwhelming welcome that I received from the hundreds of thousands of Indian citizens assembled on the side of the road was indeed a remarkable experience for me. There was a genuine expression of happiness and good will and friendship on their faces, and their raised hands and smiles made me feel, indeed, that I was welcome.
I also had a sense of belonging. I didn't feel that I was in an alien land. I think the reason for this is that my family has grown to respect and to love India in the last 10 years. When my mother was 68 years old, she became a member of the Peace Corps and requested that she be sent to India. She is a registered nurse, and she worked in a small clinic in a village of Vikhroli, just north of Bombay. One of the reasons that she requested India—perhaps the most important reason—was tier awareness of what your nation represents as expressed by the commitment and the courage and the humility of Mahatma Gandhi.
So, our family, although this is my first visit, has felt a part of your life. When your former great President Ahmed died, I had just become President of our country. And my mother and my son, who has the same name as I, came to represent the United States during that sorrowful time. So I felt a sense of belonging this afternoon.
In the presence of the members of your Parliament, the welcome that I received there, the attention that was given to my words, a sense of political ties was very strong. Again, I felt that I was in a place which shared commitments and not in a strange place where the form of government was unknown to me; a sense of democracy, a sense that everyone in that assembly hall indeed represented the people of India was something very similar to a person who has served in the government in our own country as well.
I had a thought this morning, too, about the beauty of India, as I stood at the memorial to Gandhi. This is a lovely time of year. And the flowers are bursting forth. I walked for an hour or so this afternoon in the Mortal Garden outside this palace and was impressed by the quietness and a sense of peace, and even in your busy streets and alongside the highways there is a sense of inward beauty among the people, a sense of inward peace in their hearts, and also outward beauty in your buildings, in your trees, and in your flowers.
I also felt a common purpose with you in the principles which we all represent: freedom of speech, a free press, a right to criticize, a right to disagree, open debate, issues thoroughly discussed, changes welcomed, even in a nation which is ancient in its customs and in its traditions.
We share a common measurement of greatness, not power or pomp or ceremony or uniforms or outward show of greatness, but we recognize that greatness is present when the least of those in our nations are treated well and cared for, when their afflictions are eased, and when they have food and education and a healthy life.
I also, Mr. President, shared your words a few moments ago in a hunger for peace, not only in individuals but as a nation and as leaders in the world.
India sets a moral standard for many of us to emulate. And the judgment that is spoken by the leaders of your country makes a great impact on those of us who sometimes have been criticized. We think twice before we incur the disapproval of India and your leaders, because we realize that your standards of morality and justice are very deeply felt.
You have an ability to bridge the gap between those who have a developed society, and you understand in personal terms the hungers and the needs and the yearnings and the unmet aspirations of those who live in nations which are still developing.
The last thing I would like to say is that there has been somewhat of a circle of influence between our country and yours. I'm very proud of my Nation, although most of my words have been in praise of your own. I have read some of the works of Mahatma Gandhi, and I know that he was greatly impressed by our poet Ralph Waldo Emerson and by a man who loved God's world, Henry David Thoreau. I brought your Prime Minister a gift of the collected works of Thoreau because of Ghandi's respect for him.
And when Gandhi learned even more and gave his life in the cause for which he stood, many of our own people learned from him and were inspired by him.
This afternoon, I just mentioned one of our leaders, Martin Luther King, Jr., who studied the works of Gandhi and adopted nonviolence and the force of truth as the essence of his own beliefs. And although he never carried a weapon and never struck another human being, but turned his face when he was beaten and suffered many times in jails, he remembered the teachings of Gandhi.
So, from our country to you, and from you back to our country, there is a circle of learning, a circle of mutual trust, a circle of friendship, a circle of respect, and also a circle of shared responsibilities and shared commitments.
The quality of our life is not yet what we would hope. We have many things to learn. We have many grievances to redress. We have many degrees of freedom still left to enhance. We are far short of our dream of peace. But in a democratic society like our own, when the yearnings of every person can make an impact upon the decisions of the leaders, there is always a sure sense that progress will be ever upward.
I would like to propose a toast on behalf of my own Nation and the American citizens who are here tonight, Mr. President: To President Reddy, to Mrs. Reddy, to the distinguished leaders of India, to the great people of India, and to peace throughout the world.

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President, Mrs. Frei, members of the Chilean delegation, distinguished guests, welcome to the White House. Mr. President, I enjoyed our meeting today, especially your perspective as a trained engineer committed to building bridges. [Laughter] You have more experience and credibility at that than I have, but I am glad to be your partner in building those bridges.
The United States respects the extraordinary accomplishments of the Chilean people, the brave struggle to reclaim democracy which has cast the light of liberty over your land and over the entire hemisphere. The United States respects the extraordinary economic achievements of Chile, which have shined the light of hope over your land and the entire hemisphere.
Beyond democracy, you have advanced equality before the law and good government. Beyond economic growth, you have advanced fuller participation in Chile's prosperity, reducing poverty and increasing education so that all may have their chance. Under your leadership, Chile is a crossroads for global commerce, a force of freedom and peace, a valued partner of the United States in building a better world for the 21st century.
Three decades ago, Mr. President, during the time of the Alliance for Progress launched by President Kennedy, your father made plans for a state visit to our country. That visit never came to pass. And in the years that followed, the bright hopes that our nations had for cooperation in our hemisphere went unrealized. Now we stand at a moment of unprecedented promise for the Americas. Just as you donned your father's ceremonial sash when you took office, you have completed the journey to the United States that he once set out to make.
Now we must make our bold journey into tomorrow together. Mr. President, I gave a book of poems by your great Chilean poet Pablo Neruda to my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary. In his ""Ode to the Sea,"" Neruda wrote these words that speak to us tonight across the years: ""We'll put the affairs of mankind in order, big things first, then all the rest. We will make you see an Earth, we will make you perform miracles, because inside us, inside our struggle is our daily bread, our fish, and our miracle.""
Mr. President, you have put big things first: democracy, justice, freedom, the future. In so doing, you have given the Chilean people the chance to reach deep within themselves to perform miracles.
Tonight it's my great honor to ask all those here present to join me in toasting you, Mrs. Frei, people of Chile, and the bright promise of our partnership.

The President. Your Royal Highness, it is a great honor for Laura and me to host you and Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall at the White House. Your visit is a reminder of the unique and enduring bond between the United Kingdom and the United States. Americans know that we have no greater friend than the United Kingdom. And it's my sincere hope that the United Kingdom knows it has no greater admirer than the United States.
Our nations are intimately linked through deep historical and cultural ties, through active commercial and political bonds, and through shared values. Nowhere are those shared values more nobly expressed than in our common commitment to expanding freedom in this world.
In the first part of the 20th century, our nations stood together to ensure that fascism did not prevail in Europe. In the second half of the 20th century, we worked tirelessly to defeat the totalitarian ideology of communism. And today, we're fighting side by side against an ideology of hatred and intolerance to ensure that the 21st century will be one of liberty and hope.
The people of the United States draw great strength from having the United Kingdom as an ally. The nation that defied bombardment from the air in 1940 once again refused to cower when its people were bombed from underground this summer. Your courage and fortitude are an inspiration to people throughout the world.
Just as Britain is a leader in the effort to spread freedom and opportunity abroad, Your Royal Highness is a leader in creating greater opportunity at home. Your compassion and charitable efforts such as the Prince's Trust continue to help more of Britain's young people and entrepreneurs pursue their dreams in life.
Your Royal Highness, your generous spirit, your steadfast leadership, and your devotion to your people are an inspiration. Laura and I are honored to have you and Her Royal Highness as guests this evening, and I'd now like to offer a toast to the enduring friendship between the United Kingdom and the United States.
Prince Charles. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, ladies and gentlemen, can I just say what a joy it is for both my wife and myself to be with you here in the White House. It brings back many fond and happy memories of my first visit here with my sister. I think it was in 1970, when we came to stay at the White House for the weekend with President and Mrs. Nixon, at the time when the media were busy trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon. [Laughter] And it's very interesting to see the same sort of thing happening to my eldest son. [Laughter] So it seems to be an entirely hereditary feature. [Laughter]
Mr. President, Sir Winston Churchill, whose mother was, of course, American, and whose bust you have in a place of honor in the Oval Office, once said, after one of his 16 visits to the United States over some 66 years, ""The friendliness of the Americans to the traveler from Britain, their unfailing kindness, their generous hospitality are something to marvel at."" Well, nothing has changed, Mr. President. We have both most certainly experienced the same generosity and friendliness since our arrival yesterday. And this has been the case on every previous visit I have ever made to this remarkable country.
It is an indication, if I may say so, Mr. President, of how very important and special our close, warm, and enduring relationship with the United States of America is to all of us in the United Kingdom. Our two nations have much in common. We share so much history and tradition, language and culture, and a commitment to democracy and liberty. These enrich the spirit and are founded on those greatest of all gifts—friendship and loyalty.
On Friday, we will meet veterans of our struggle together against evil and tyranny in the Second World War. The selfless service that our parents' generation gave, including, of course, both our fathers—and how wonderful it is, if I may say so, to see President Bush 41 here this evening— and the selfless service that we commemorate in this 60th anniversary year will always stand as a measure of the commitment, courage, and comradeship of our two great nations.
On Thanksgiving Day in 1944, while we were Allies in arms in that global struggle, Sir Winston Churchill looked forward to what he called ""a lasting union of sympathy and good feeling and loyalty and hope between all the British and American peoples."" Well, that is a vision all of us here share.
And, indeed, that lasting union of sympathy has been so amply demonstrated in our own day when we shared with you the full horror of September the 11th, 4 years ago, and more recently, when following the terrorist attacks in London, so many of us in the United Kingdom were profoundly touched by the many messages of steadfast support and solidarity from across the United States.
But our visit is not focused only on the misfortunes that have united our nations. We were particularly pleased to have had the chance this afternoon to go with Mrs. Bush to the inspiring SEED School in Anacostia, a school that offers young people from underprivileged backgrounds the chance to fulfill the potential that each person has. And this, incidentally, is what my Prince's Trust has been seeking to do for very nearly 30 years in the United Kingdom, and which has led to over half a million young people being assisted to develop their individual talents and abilities.
And, Mr. President, I am also very conscious of the extraordinary social progress this country has achieved. On the day Rosa Parks is laid to rest, there is a powerful message, I think, here about tolerance and inclusion that has relevance for the whole international community.
My wife and I are deeply grateful to you, Mr. President, and Mrs. Bush for your generous hospitality towards us, but more so, as I am only too conscious of the enormous challenges and responsibilities which face the 43d President of the United States. And I need hardly say that so many people throughout the world look to the United States of America for a lead on the most crucial issues that face our planet and, indeed, the lives of our grandchildren. Truly, the burdens of the world rest on your shoulders.
In conclusion may I propose a toast to you, Mr. President, to Mrs. Bush, and to the people of the United States of America.
[At this point, the President and Prince Charles offered a toast.]

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"March 26, 1979","
PRESIDENT CARTER. President Sadat, Prime Minister Begin, Egyptian friends, Israeli friends, American fiends:
This is one of those evenings that it's been hard for me to stay seated also, I've been so excited.
Most of the times in history when a peace treaty was signed, one nation has been a victor and the other nation has been vanquished. One nation has won; the other nation has lost. Today we've signed a peace treaty when both nations have won.
This is indeed a joyous occasion. We've prayed for peace, and we have worked for peace. And now we humbly give thanks to God that we can celebrate the beginnings of peace in the Middle East.
I've gotten to know these two men on my right in the last 18 months—sometimes too well. [Laughter] We have spent days and days together, hours and hours together, planning, arguing, debating, negotiating. And I have come to know them and to respect them, to form a friendship, a sense of brotherhood and even love with both of them. They are men of great courage, great sensitivity, great patriotism and statesmanship; men who never feared to face difficult questions and seek persistently for the answers. They've been men who have inspired me and who have been inspired by the people in their own great nations whom they represent.
The peace that was born today has a meaning that comes down to us through many years or generations, even centuries. In ancient days, God promised Abraham that from his seed would come many nations. And as you know, that promise has been fulfilled. Yet for much too long, the people of Israel and the people of Egypt-two of the nations of the children of Abraham, trusting in the same God, hoping for the same peace—knew only enmity between them. That time, thank God, is now at an end.
Now, after 30 years, four wars, countless deaths, terrible anguish, we can see a new era ahead, an era, we hope, in which violence no longer dominates the Middle East. And the just concerns of all of us can find a peaceful solution to the problems that we share and a peaceful expression of the hopes and dreams of people who look to us for leadership.
The path for peace has brought us a long way in a short time. It was only 16 months ago that President Sadat made his extraordinary and historic journey to Jerusalem. He was received there by Prime Minister Begin and was followed by Prime Minister Begin's equally historic trip to Ismailia.
Their vision and their courage stirred hopes in the hearts of people throughout the world.
The distance we've come since then is little short of miraculous. There were difficult moments, many difficult moments; times when the differences seemed impossible to overcome. But at each of those times, just a few simple realities summoned us to renewed effort: first of all, the knowledge that the people—the people of Egypt and the people of Israel—no matter what the leaders might have done, deeply and passionately desired peace; second, the awareness that the process which we had initiated was the only practical route to progress; third, the obligation that was felt to those who have suffered so much—to the young, to the old, and to future generations; and I think above all, the depth of our common faith in a just and a merciful God.
These things sustained us, and they've brought us here tonight.
I would like to note here a simple fact: that when others could not or would not move to end the seemingly endless tragedy of the Middle East, two men—President Anwar Sadat and Prime Minister Menahem Begin—dared to think the unthinkable, dared to do what others feared could not be done, dared to seize history in their hands and to turn history toward peace. And I am thankful to them both.
Theirs is the vision of the psalmist who said: ""Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!""
But this is an achievement not just of leaders but of peoples, strong and creative peoples, proud of past heritage and present achievements, and wise enough to know that future well-being can be assured only through cooperation and a very difficult element of mutual trust.
Tonight we commemorate not an end, but a beginning, for a treaty between Egypt and Israel is but the first step along a long and a rough and a narrow and a very difficult road.
We hope that the Palestinians and others will soon join us in our efforts to make this treaty the cornerstone of a comprehensive peace, a true and a lasting peace, a just peace for the entire Middle East. I welcome and invite those who have so far held back—for whatever motive they might honor—to join us in the future. The way is long and the way is hard, but peace is the way.
We share a vision of a time when all the people of the Middle East may turn their energies back to the works of life, when young people can marry and start families and have a hope of seeing and knowing their own children's children, when the old can end their lives quietly after witnessing many a gentle spring. We pray for that time, and we shall continue to work for that time.
This is a season of renewal, when the Earth brings forth life. The Koran tells us of a prophet and a king of Israel for whom God's power ""made the violent wind blow tamely."" The Old Testament tells us the words of that same king, the words of King Solomon, David's son: For every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven.
For centuries the people of Israel were dispersed around the world, often despised and persecuted. For centuries the people of Egypt suffered under foreign domination. Only in the past generation have these two proud and ancient peoples again become independent nations.
But that generation, to use the words of King Solomon, has also been a time to die, to pluck up that which was planted, a time to kill, a time of breaking down, a time to mourn, a time of weeping, a time to lose, a time to hate, and a time for war. We pray that the season of weeping is past. And to continue the words of that same king, that now will come a time to heal, a time to plant, a time to build up, a time to laugh, a time to dance, a time to embrace, a time to love.
We pray to God that at last the children of Abraham have come to a time of peace.
And now, I would like to propose a toast: To the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Anwar al-Sadat, and to the Prime Minister of the State of Israel, Menahem Begin; to the great peoples they serve, the people of Egypt and the people of Israel, now joined together in hope; and to the cause we all serve: salaam, shalom, and to peace.
PRESIDENT SADAT. President Carter, Prime Minister Begin, dear friends:
Only a few hours ago we laid down a solid foundation for a lasting peace in the Middle East. We did so in a determined effort to heal the wounds of the past and usher in a new era of love and fraternity. At long last cousins will be able to revive the traditions of the glorious past when they lived side by side in peace and harmony.
Our great friend, President Carter, who was the architect of the entire process, spoke of the new reality which is dawning. We all share his hopes and aspirations. We want to see a steady progress on the road to peace. This will require a positive movement on all fronts.
Within a few weeks, we will be entering into negotiations with the goal of establishing a self-governing authority with full autonomy on the West Bank and Gaza. The success of these negotiations will depend largely on the ability of all parties to rise to the level of events and demonstrate their good faith. Above all, it depends upon an active American role. President Carter has promised me to spare 'no effort to ensure the coronation of our efforts.
I have full confidence in him. He has been a wonderful partner and a courageous statesman. He has shown an unparalleled understanding of the plight of the Palestinian people. He is sensitive to their legitimate call for the eradication of the injustice that was inflicted upon them in the unhappy past.
We all realize their need to be reassured that they will be able soon to take the first step on the road to self-determination and statehood. A dialog with their representatives will be very helpful. It would also be consistent with American tradition.
It is with this in mind that we proceed towards the completion of this sacred mission. None of us can bear the responsibility of defeating the expectations of millions across the borders. None of us can interfere with the course of history or turn the clock back.
We should seize this opportunity. We should seize this opportunity, this historic opportunity in this historic gathering, which is hosted by the American people, to pledge ourselves to the continuation of the process. We should vow to employ all the moral strength we muster, to ensure the ultimate success of our endeavor.
Dear friends, I ask you to rise in a tribute to President Carter, his spouse, the American people, and to the millions of people of good will everywhere, Mr. Begin and Mrs. Begin.
PRIME MINISTER BEGIN. President Carter, Mrs. Carter, President Sadat, Mrs. Sadat, ladies and gentlemen:
Amongst the many guests assembled here, there is a lady from Norway. Her name is Mrs. Lionaes. She was, until recently, the chairman of the committee of the Norwegian Parliament for the Nobel Peace Prize. I invited her to come today and to be with us, because when the award was granted by that committee to two men, she was under certain criticism from some circles. And I asked her, after the ceremony of signing, whether now she can say that she and her colleagues did not make a mistake. And she said, with very characteristic bravery, ""I never had any doubts."" [Laughter]
Now, my dear friend, Mrs. Lionaes, when you come back home, I have a request to you, respectfully, to get in touch with your former colleagues, the members of the Nobel Prize committee of the democratic parliament of your country. I suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that all of us—President Sadat and myself, members of the three Cabinets of the United States, of Egypt, and Israel, Members of Congress of both Houses, Members of the Knesset, writers, singers, all of us assembled here—do decide to nominate President Jimmy Carter as a candidate- [applause] —I didn't yet say a candidate for what— [laughter] —as a candidate to receive the Nobel Peace Prize of 1979. And please, no sharing of the award. [Laughter] All the prize is due to the President of the United States. And, Mr. President, if on the 10th of December, this year, you go to Oslo, and you invite President Sadat and me to be witnesses for that ceremony, I am positive that both of us will be in Oslo. It is due to you, my dear friend, Mr. President. You deserve it amply. And I am sure on the 10th of December you will be crowned with the great, international, famous award, the Nobel Peace Prize.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pay tribute to a man who is the main adviser of the President of this great country, and his friend and my friend. And as I know all the goings and comings and all the legal formulations about every word or letter, or even comma, I can say to you tonight that a great service was rendered to the United States, to Egypt, to Israel, and to the cause of peace by a gentleman who did so much day and night with his inventive mind, with his great learning and knowledge, and who bears another title. He is also the husband of the perfect lady whom my wife and I love dearly and respect highly. I refer to the Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance.
And the last remark, ladies and gentlemen, will be absolutely personal. And I will apologize for making it, but I have to. In the afternoon, I spoke about survival and perseverance. Tonight, in your presence, I would like to thank for that ability to persevere one human being who is here, whom I met when she was 17 years old, my own wife.
And again, I will quote a prophet, Yirmeyahu. This time I will translate.
[At this point, the Prime Minister spoke in Hebrew.]
""And I will remember the grace of your youth, the love of your nuptials following me into the desert, into a land sown with mines.""
Now we arrived to be here on this day. Let us thank God Almighty that he gave us, together, and our children and our grandchildren the strength to withstand all the tests, which sometimes were quite difficult, until I could, on behalf of our people, to do the greatest human act, sign a peace treaty. In the circle of friendship of President Carter, President Sadat, and myself, we stand together. And we vow to continue to be always together and work for peace.
And therefore, I raise my glass. I raise my glass to President Carter, President of the United States of America, the mighty democracy which saved the world twice from the danger of tyranny, militarism, and totalitarianism, and which is still the guarantee for human liberty; and to President Sadat, whom I met for the first time in Jerusalem. And since then—as it is true, it comes from my heart—I have a deep sentiment for him. And under any circumstances, I will guard it in the depths of my heart.
And let us raise a toast to friendship between America, Egypt, and Israel, forever. Thank you.
PRESIDENT SADAT. Ladies and gentlemen, until last night, whenever I meet with Premier Begin, we seldom come in conformity. [Laughter] The miracle was achieved today. And let me say this in all candor: I am in full conformity with Premier Begin, and let us hope that we shall continue. I support his proposal that our dear friend, President Carter, be elected as the man of peace of '79. Thank you.
PRESIDENT CARTER. Thank you.
I might point out to President Sadat and to Prime Minister Begin that if the next 9 months of negotiations are completely harmonious, constructive, cooperative, and in a spirit of friendship, and if we meet all the requirements of the Camp David agreements and the peace treaty we signed today, then I might consider accepting their nomination. Otherwise, they have made their toasts in vain.
I think we've proven today, and in the last 18 months or so, that there can be peace between our three nations and an inspiration for the whole world. I can feel a certain sense of satisfaction and gratitude, of harmony, friendship, inspiration, kind of an electrical current of common purpose in this group tonight. And I think it extends to Egypt and to Israel and, indeed, throughout the world.
Political achievement has been wonderful. But now I think it's time for us to shift our attention to another sense of harmony, to show that superb talent can indeed transcend national boundaries. Each of our nations, through the leaders, have suggested for tonight's program superb performers. President Sadat has requested Omar Khorshed to come to represent Egypt; a superb musician, a superb composer, and a superb actor. Prime Minister Begin, to represent Israel, has asked Itzhak Perlman, a very well-known and beloved performer, and Pinchas Zukerman, who will accompany him, two of the most talented men who have ever lived. And my wife and I have requested Leontyne Price to sing to represent the United States of America.
We will witness, without further introductions, a higher reality of human achievement, beauty, excellence, high ambition, reached by human beings.
Some of the performers had to overcome great handicaps, physical handicaps, racial handicaps. But they will all show tonight that what they are is the exemplification of humanity that can indeed be an inspiration to us all.
Now for a few minutes, I think we will enjoy some of the finest examples of achievement from our three countries.
I am indeed grateful that you've come tonight. It's a wonderful and historic evening. And I believe it will be an exciting and enjoyable evening as well. And you will certify that, I am sure, with your own applause after these performers give us the inspiration for which they are so greatly qualified.
Thank you again. Good evening.
"
state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"June 16, 1974","
Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, and all the very distinguished guests on this very great occasion:
I say it is a very great occasion, because for Mrs. Nixon and for me, for Secretary Kissinger and all of your American guests, it is a great moment for us to be entertained here in this place which means so much to this country, which has won our admiration and affection and respect over the years and also because of the very gracious and eloquent remarks that have been made by the President in proposing the toast to the President of the United States.
To President Katzir, of course, I will propose a toast in response. But it is the prerogative of presidents sometimes to break precedents. Normally, there is only one toast in an evening, particularly a state dinner.
Tonight, I would like to propose a second toast and propose it first, not in derogation of your President, but because I discussed the matter with him and have his permission.
I have had the great privilege over the past 27 years to travel to over 80 countries. I have met most of the leaders of the world. Some were called great, some near great, and some were called things much worse than that. I also have had a chance as President to meet, talk to, and evaluate most of the leaders on the current scene today and those who have been on it over the past 5 years.
And I can say to this audience here gathered in the Knesset in Israel that no leader I have met, no president, no king, no prime minister, or any other leader has demonstrated in the meetings that I have had with that leader greater courage, greater intelligence, and greater stamina, greater determination, and greater dedication to her country than Prime Minister Meir.
The President has informed me that this is the first state dinner that has been held in this room, this great hall, since she left that post, and consequently, I thought that I, having worked with her, having become her friend, and she has been my friend, that I might have the honor and the privilege to ask you to join me in a toast to the former Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Golda Meir. To Golda.
MRS. MEIR. As President Nixon says, presidents can do almost anything, and President Nixon has done many things that nobody would have thought of doing. All I can say, Mr. President, as friends and as an Israeli citizen to a great American President, thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. In responding also to the very eloquent remarks of President Katzir, it gives me an opportunity to reflect for a moment on the contribution that has been made to my country, the United States of America, by those of Jewish background. I could mention them in many fields, and the names are legion. Their accomplishments in many cases certainly exceed those of any group that we could possibly imagine. And I suppose that sometimes those who do not know America and do not know our system wonder how it happens.
We have no quota system. We don't do it because we are trying to recognize people, because they happen to represent a particular group in the society. Oh, there is some of that in politics, there always is. But just to give you an idea as to the standard that most of us, as Americans, have applied and that I have tried to apply, I recall that when I made the appointment of Dr. Kissinger as Secretary of State, much ado was made about it, and they said, ""Well, President Nixon has appointed the first Jewish Secretary of State.""
And I can say to this audience here, I appointed him not because he happened to be of Jewish background, I appointed him because he was absolutely the best man for the job, and he has proved to be the best man for the job.
And when we speak of the programs for peace to which the United States is dedicating itself now and to which we have been dedicated throughout this Administration, a great deal of the credit goes to this man, one who worked long and hard when he was an Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and now who works twice as hard when he holds that position and the position of Secretary of State and three times as hard since he is also now married.
The other point that I thought was appropriate to touch upon in responding to the toast by the President of Israel was for me to pay a tribute to those who have served in the armed forces of this country. I had an opportunity, as I pointed out when I arrived at the airport, to see some of them at the conclusion of the war in 1967. Some of them had been wounded and some of them, of course, most of them, were well, all of them were enormously impressive.
I saw an honor guard today, and I can see, as I look here at the present chief of staff, that the quality of the Israeli Armed Forces is as high now as it was then.
Throughout the world, Israeli soldiers, airmen, sailors have earned respect for their courage, for their discipline, and of course, for their enormous effectiveness in the battles that they have had to fight. And one of the reasons that Israel has survived is that in addition to having the arms which they have had, that they have had the personnel, the skilled personnel, the dedicated personnel, the patriotic personnel that could use those arms effectively in defense of their country.
And as I think of those armed forces and what they have done, I would like to reiterate what has been American policy not only in this Administration--it was in the previous ones and ever since Israel became a modern state, and it will be, I think, in the next Administration, whatever the outcome of the next election may be--to reiterate the fact that the United States and Israel are friends, that the United States has responded when Israel has had problems involving its defense. We have tried to respond as generously and effectively as we can.
We have known that when we have responded, that whatever help we have been able to give will be used well. And that is a tribute to the men and the women who serve in the armed forces, the men and women who led them, and certainly in this respect, Israel can be proud of those in uniform who have had to go to war too often, but necessarily, in order to see that this state survived.
Now, I suppose many of you wonder what a tribute to the Armed Forces of Israel has to do about talking concerning the Secretary of State who has worked for peace and of responding to a toast by the President of Israel which is concerned about peace.
Very simply, I would like to tell you how I felt as I drove through the streets of this city today. I saw many people, and of course, as an American I was proud to see so many with the American flags and the Israeli flags, their friendly welcome.
But as is often the case as I travel through cities with my wife and we see people along the sides of the street, knowing always that they are there not to welcome us personally so much as to perhaps to pay their respect to the great nation that we are proud to represent, what impresses me the most always are the children. They are so young, they are so full of hope, they are so full of life, and they deserve, I think, a better chance than we had, not that we have any complaints.
All of us who live in these times should recognize that whatever our hardships are, these are great times, great times because they are times in which we are changing the world, and we are changing it, we trust, for the better.
But what we are all trying to do in our governments, be they large or small, what we are all trying to do in serving our countries, whether proudly wearing the uniform or in the Foreign Service, as the case might be, or as a member of the Parliament, we are trying to create a better nation and a better world for those thousands of children we saw on the streets here, yes, and the thousands of children I have seen in the streets of Cairo, Leningrad, London, Japan--all over the world.
This may sound rather idealistic and overly simplistic, but I am convinced that what motivates the great majority of the leaders of the world today, whatever their differences may be on major matters, is a desire to have progress within their countries and is a recognition that without peace there cannot be sustained progress.
And so we now come to the problems we confront in building that kind of peace. It takes courage, and great courage, to fight in war, and we admire that courage. And I pay tribute particularly tonight to those in the Israeli Armed Forces who have shown courage far beyond the call of duty in their service to their country every time they have been called to serve.
It also takes courage, a different kind of courage, to wage peace. It requires risks, just as war requires risks, and the stakes are high, just as the stakes in war are high. And so, this is what has characterized our foreign policy which has been subject perhaps to some legitimate criticism, because we have taken risks, the opening, for example, of relations on a new basis with the People's Republic of China, not because there was any difference in our attitude toward their system of government or their attitude toward ours, but because the leaders of the People's Republic of China had one-fourth 'of all the people in the world, and unless the United States of America, as the most prosperous nation in the world today, finds a way to start a dialog with the most populous nation in the world today, 15, 20, 25 years from now, the whole human race may pay a very great price.
And so, we began. All differences are not ended. But the dialog is begun, and peace in the Pacific has a better chance to survive as a result of that risk we took.
Our dialog with the Soviet Union has been subjected, as we know, to some rather sharp criticism. It also contains risks for us, perhaps for them as well. But the alternative to negotiation, of course, is confrontation, and the alternative to talking is to return to the cold war where there would be no influence whatever of the United States on their policies, or theirs, for that matter, on ours, where they might come into armed confrontation.
And it is in that spirit that we will go to Moscow again, just a week after returning from the Mideast, on June 27, go there to continue a dialog between the two strongest nations in the world, but to continue it recognizing that under no circumstances, will we negotiate at the expense of any other nation, large or small.
We believe that is in the interest of peace, because if the two strongest nations are unable to find a way to live together in peace, uneasy, competitive, call it what you will, the chances for civilization to survive, the civilization which we feel so strongly as we stand in this place here tonight, the chance for that civilization to survive is infinitely less.
And that brings us, of course, to the area of the Mideast. I would be, as a pragmatist, and my colleague, Dr. Kissinger, also as a pragmatist, would agree that when we talk about bringing an era of peace to the Mideast, we do not consider this to be a simple task, an easy task, or even one in which the goal can surely be achieved. But we do know that we must try. We do know that we must begin. There have been four wars in a little over a generation in this area, and unless we change the situation some way, somehow, there will be another war and another one, and each one, of course, is terribly costly to the nations involved and particularly to this nation, of course, since you feel it, since you are here, and also potentially very dangerous to the peace of the world.
What is the U.S. role? Let me state it very simply: Under no circumstances does the fact that the United States is seeking better relations with some of Israel's neighbors mean that the friendship of the United States and the support for Israel is any less. What it simply means is this: We feel that if by creating a different relationship, by bringing a new element into the discussions that may take place in this area, by bringing perhaps some new ideas to the attention of those other nations in the area who have been involved in war over these past years, that there is a chance that the process that has begun, the two disengagements with which you are familiar can be and will be continued, and that eventually we can achieve the goal of a just and enduring peace for this area.
And that brings me, finally, to the leaders in this room--and they are leaders of very great quality. And if those in the diplomatic corps and those in the American community who are guests will forgive me for a moment, let me address these remarks only to those who are here from our host, from Israel. There is a new Prime Minister and a new government. I know the new Prime Minister well. He is, as we know, one of Israel's and one of the world's most famed military men. He was a man of great courage, great discipline, and unusual ability, a leader in war.
And then he demonstrated that he could be a diplomat when he came to Washington, and after having met him first briefly in 1967, I learned to know him very well when he was there serving in Washington. And now he succeeds Golda Meir as head of government of this nation. And as I think of him, I think of the members of Parliament, I think of the members of his government, there are two courses that are open to them. The one is an easy one, an easy one particularly politically, I suppose, and that is the status quo. Don't move, because any movement has risks in it, and therefore, resist those initiatives that may be undertaken, that might lead to a negotiation which would perhaps contribute to a permanent, just, and durable peace.
But there is another way. The other, I believe, is the right way. It is the way of statesmanship, not the way of the politician alone. It is a way that does not risk your country's security. That must never be done. But it is a way that recognizes that continuous war in this area is not a solution for Israel's survival and, above all, it is not right that every possible avenue be explored to avoid it in the interest of the future of those children we saw by the hundreds and thousands on the streets of Jerusalem today.
And so, for that reason, let me say that we have been honored and proud to work with Israel and to support Israel in times when Israel found it necessary to go to war.
And now, we hope and trust that this great creative ability, which is here in such great abundance in this room and in this nation, will be used to the works of peace in the same dedication as has been shown whenever war was concerned. Because with that kind of intelligence, that kind of dedication, I am confident that together we can find a way in this very difficult area of the world, where the hatreds go back over many years, where the differences seem insoluble, where nations many times are unstable, that we can find a way to build a permanent, just, and durable peace.
I would simply close my remarks on this point by saying it is more difficult, perhaps, than the opening to China was, and that was a difficult mission and venture, but worth taking the risk. It is more difficult than our bringing America's longest and most painful war to an end and bringing it to an end in the right way so that America would remain respected in the world, respected by its allies and its adversaries alike.
It is more difficult perhaps even, some would say, than the continuing dialog between the two strongest nations in the world which must go forward if we are to have any chance for a peaceful world. Here, where civilization began, we have the greatest challenge, but also the greatest opportunity to make sure that civilization continues. This is the cradle of civilization. We must make sure that it does not become its grave.
And it is that challenge that I am confident that the leaders of Israel will join with us in trying to seek those solutions to those differences which remain, so that we can build that permanent peace that we want in this area, because peace for Israel, peace for the Mideast, will mean that the whole world has a better chance for peace.
And, Mr. President, I know from having talked to you that you are dedicated to such ideals, and consequently, in proposing this toast to the people of your country, the people of Israel, I suggest that we raise our glasses to the President of Israel.
President Katzir.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"January 10, 1984","
The President. Premier Zhao and distinguished guests, this house has been the scene of many an historic occasion, and tonight we celebrate another milestone. Premier Zhao, you are the first Chinese head of government to visit the United States, and we're honored to welcome you.
The magnitude of America's esteem and respect for Chinese civilization may not be fully understood in China today. As a boy going to school in a small town in our Midwest, I learned of the venerable Chinese culture, and it seemed then that China was a million miles away. Today our children are still taught about the great contributions China has made, and yet as we approach the 21st century, our young people think of your country as only hours away by jet plane. Technology has made us neighbors. It's up to us to make certain that we're also friends.
Mr. Premier, your visit gives me the opportunity to express the great value I place on the positive and expanding ties between our two countries. Our cooperation helps the well-being of both our peoples to blossom and serves the cause of world peace. Good will and friendship do not always, as we've found, bring agreement on every issue. But friendship gives us the freedom to disagree, even to criticize without fear of lessening cooperation in our many areas of mutual interest.
Let us always remember that open and frank dialog is the foundation that supports the bridge between us.
Mr. Premier, I remember well our last discussions in Cancun 2 years ago. I am grateful for the progress that we've made since then and look forward to even greater cooperation in the years ahead. I'm particularly pleased with the wide-ranging and constructive discussions that we enjoyed today. It was certainly a promising omen for the future and a positive way to begin a new year. Of course, the Chinese new year will not come for several weeks, but this past Year of the Pig has proven that we can feast together at the table of cooperation.
There's reason for optimism, but we must look past tomorrow and the day after and prepare with mutual trust and confidence for the next century. The bonds between our two proud and independent nations can be made a wellspring of hope and progress, of security and prosperity.
We've been watching with interest and admiration your efforts to modernize by offering incentives to your people in stimulating economic competition. We have been pleased to contribute what we could as you expand the vistas of economic opportunity for the Chinese people.
Tonight we congratulate you, Premier Zhao, for the part that you're playing in the rebirth of China's economy. Before ascending to your current position, you were a leading force in turning around the economic decline of Sichuan. Under your guidance, the province went from stagnation to vibrancy, from hunger and food importation to abundance and the export of grain. In fact, I understand that because of the work you did there it is said in China, ""If you want rice, go see Zhao."" [Laughter]
Ladies and gentlemen, to give you an idea of the significance of the Premier's economic achievements, Sichuan Province, which the Premier managed for 4 years before moving to Beijing, has a hundred million people, making it the most populous province in China and bigger than all but seven of the countries of the world. The Premier is now putting that same creativity to work on a national basis.
Premier Zhao is also known for his personal commitment to vigorous physical exercise. Tonight I would ask all of you to join me in a toast to his health and to the health of China's other distinguished leaders and to peace, prosperity, and friendship between the Chinese and American people.
The Premier. Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, from the very beginning of my visit to your country, I have been warmly received. I am greatly honored to be invited to this grand state dinner tonight. Please allow me, on behalf of my colleagues and in my own name, to express our hearty thanks to the President and Mrs. Reagan, to the U.S. Government, and friends from all circles.
Five years ago, the normalization of Sino-U.S. relations gave the people of both our countries great joy and made a far-reaching impact on the world situation. Over the past 5 years, Sino-U.S. relations have gone through twists and turns, with both advances in many fields and difficulties and obstacles cropping up along the way. The jolts and uncertainties in Sino-U.S. relations do not serve the interests of the two peoples, nor those of world peace. We hope that this disturbing situation will soon be brought to an end.
Our two sides share the desire to develop Sino-U.S. relations. I appreciate what President Reagan said, to the effect that China and the United States are destined to grow stronger through cooperation, not weaker through division. I believe that both the Chinese and American peoples hope to see advances in our friendship through joint efforts and not the undermining of our friendship by aggravation of our differences. The Taiwan issue is the major difference between China and the United States, or in other words, the principal obstacle to the growth of Sino-U.S. relations. I hope that our two sides will strictly abide by the principles guiding our bilateral relations, which we jointly established in the Sino-U.S. communiques, and fulfill the commitments each of us has undertaken, so that our differences may be resolved.
The world today is still in turbulence. The confrontation between the two military blocs has become sharper, while the North-South contradictions are not yet resolved. Before the flames of one aggressive war are extinguished, those of another have started raging. The grim reality constrains everybody to worry about the future of the world. It also heightens the sense of responsibility and urgency of all the peace-loving countries and people for the maintenance of world peace. China will work in concert with them to ease international tension, stop the arms race, oppose power politics, and maintain world peace.
China has always been opposed to arms race, particularly nuclear arms race, and stands for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. We have long declared that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. We are critical of the discriminatory Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but we do not advocate or encourage nuclear proliferation. We do not engage in nuclear proliferation ourselves, nor do we help other countries develop nuclear weapons. We actively support all proposals that are truly helpful to realizing nuclear disarmament, terminating the nuclear arms race and eliminating the threat of nuclear war.
[At this point, the Premier paused, and his interpreter addressed the dinner guests as follows.]
Interpreter. Ladies and gentlemen, there's some changing in the last paragraph, so I have to translate it.
""Today I have had talks with President Reagan and some of his Cabinet members in a friendly and candid atmosphere. These talks have helped to enhance our mutual understanding, and both sides have expressed a desire to further develop Sino-U.S. relations. We both agreed that there are great potentials for economic and technological cooperation between our two countries, and are willing to take a positive attitude to further increase our cooperation.
""I sincerely hope that my visit and President Reagan's visit to China in April will help to promote steady and durable growth of Sino-U.S. relations on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. This will serve the interest of our two peoples and that of world peace.""
The Premier. Allow me to propose a toast to the health of the President and Mrs. Reagan, to the health of the Vice President and Mrs. Bush, to the health of all our friends present here, to the happiness of the American people, to the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, and to world peace!

state-dinners,George Bush,"September 10, 1991","
President Bush. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House. And to President and Mrs. Diouf and members of the Senegal delegation, a very special welcome.
Nine years ago, Barbara and I were hosted in Senegal, never forgotten that trip. And today, we have the opportunity to try in this manner to repay Senegal's marvelous hospitality. And we welcome to America's home, to this White House, a first citizen of the continent of Africa. This week provides an opportunity for our countries to renew the shared interest which link our two nations and peoples and the values that join us, the values we hold so dear. We both revere liberty and human dignity and respect for the rights of man. And we each believe for individuals, choice; for society, pluralism; and for nations, self-determination.
And together, by lifting minds and horizons, we are helping to shape a new world order. You see, Senegal was the first sub-Saharan African nation to say to Saddam Hussein, ""Your aggression will not stand."" And America, sir, applauds your courage in opposing this threat to world security. You lifted up, you buoyed the coalition, and you showed that strength of character will always outlast strength of arms.
Mr. President, you know, as recent events have verified, totalitarianism is crumbling because democracy would not, will not be denied. And now, let us all pledge to help Senegal's democratic system serve as a model for those countries seeking to embrace the principles of self-government, self-determination, and freedom of expression.
We seek a world in which the lamp of liberty brightens every corner of the Earth. And in that spirit, I would like to close with words from Leopold Senghor, a poet-politician who was the first President and founder of independent Senegal. Forty-six years ago, near the end of World War II, President Senghor wrote ""A Prayer For Peace,"" and he spoke of the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America and concluded this way: ""Grant that their warm hands embrace the Earth in a band of brotherly hands under the rainbow of your peace.""
Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen, now I would ask that you guests and others join me in a toast: to the health of our good friend, President Diouf, to the happiness and prosperity of the Senegalese people, and to those brotherly hands which can build a peace for our children and all the children of the world.
God bless you, Mr. President. Welcome to the White House.
President Diouf. Mr. President, allow me to say how happy my wife and I, and also the delegation accompanying me, are to be in this great country and among its friendly people. I come at the invitation of a very close, personal friend and a great respected leader, whose dynamism in terms of ideas, clear-sightedness, and steadfastness of purpose evoke admiration.
I come to meet a great people who have established themselves as staunch defenders of the ideals of freedom, democracy, peace, and respect for human rights. They are the people whom you have referred to as ""a beacon of hope shining for the whole world.""
The developments that have taken place in recent months have brought to the fore how you view these peoples' responsibilities, and they have demonstrated the correctness of your vision. They have given us Senegalese added reasons to be proud to be counted among your friends and to share with you the same ideals.
By this, I'm not just referring to the crucial part that your country played in solving the Gulf crisis. What I also have in mind, and I should like to emphasize this, is the triumph of the principles which form the basis of the societies we are striving to build and our common wish to see a new order prevail in international relations. I know that I also speak for you when I stress that this new order should be characterized more by the rule of law, a greater solidarity among peoples and nations, as well as a full respect for human rights and basic freedoms. But I hasten to point out that it should also foster a process of democratization of international relations so that we are able to entrench democracy better within all states and to usher in a world in which the ballot paper will permanently replace the bullet. This would indeed be a wonderful posthumous victory for one of your illustrious predecessors, who said of the ballot that it is stronger than the bullet.
The United Nations, which has yet again proved its usefulness and effectiveness, appears to me as the prime instrument to achieve that objective. And with the United States at the forefront, the outcome of the struggle is never in doubt. For all these reasons I should like to express, in addition to my compatriots' deep admiration for Your Excellency, my government's determination to intensify, strengthen, and diversify the excellent relations that happily exist between our two countries. Better still, we want to reinforce day by day the age-old links that our two peoples have established and that will be symbolized by the Goree-Almadies Memorial.
The exceptionally warm welcome showered on my wife and me and on my delegation, and your determination to help Senegal succeed in its development efforts, are clear indications that you are similarly well-disposed towards us. That is why my visit could not have got off to a better start. That is also why I look forward to seeing our already exemplary bilateral cooperation develop further. And I'm delighted to meet again a very dear friend of mine.
With this fond hope, I invite you, ladies and gentlemen, to raise your glasses and drink to the health and personal happiness of His Excellency, Mr. George Bush, and Madam Barbara Bush, to whom I pay my humble respects: to friendship and co- operation between the United States and Senegal, to the sustained prosperity of the friendly American people, to freedom and democracy for all peoples.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"April 26, 2014","
King Abdul Halim. The Honorable President Barack Obama, President of the United States; Excellencies; honored guests; ladies and gentlemen: The Raja Permaisuri Agong joins us in warmly welcoming you, Mr. President, and your delegation to Istana Negara on the occasion of your state visit to Malaysia.
The visit clearly manifests the excellent state of the longstanding relations between our governments and people of Malaysia and the United States.
Your Honorable, we are heartened that your visit builds upon the close bond of friendship between our two countries on the recent missing flight MH370 involving many nationalities, including Malaysians and Americans. We wish to express our utmost gratitude for the U.S. unwavering support and cooperation. Your involvement since the beginning of the search and rescue mission and the ongoing recovery operation indeed exemplifies the strong commitment established between our two countries.
We are pleased to see the ties between our two countries gaining so much traction. Over the years, the two countries' common interests and shared values have flourished. We are also delighted that both our countries will be discussing ways to strengthen cooperation in wide-ranging areas of economy, security and defense, education, energy, science and technology, and people-to-people relations.
The economic ties between our two countries have been very strong. Your continuous support to our country's economic growth would prepare Malaysia in its aspiration to reach the developed nation status.
We welcome the United States to continue working hand in hand with Malaysia to ensure the peace and stability of the region. This could be attained through the shared values and mutual respect, understanding, and moderation, coupled by the strong people-to-people relations, testifying both our countries' good will and mutual understanding.
Mr. President, you can be rest assured that Malaysia will continue our efforts to build a strong, nourished, and lasting relationship between the United States as a foundation for the stability and prosperity of our countries.
We hope that your visit to Malaysia is both meaningful and memorable. It is our hope that you will enjoy our hospitality and return to the United States with fond memories of Malaysia. We pray for your continued good health, as well as for that of your family and for the people of the United States. We pray also for peace, stability, and prosperity for both our countries in the years to come.
Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to invite all of you to join us in proposing a toast to the President and the people of the United States.
Thank you.
[At this point, a toast was offered.] President Obama. Good evening. Selamat petang. Your Majesty, thank you so much for those warm words. To you; Her Majesty; Madam Rosmah; Prime Minister; distinguished guests and friends: Thank you for the extraordinary hospitality that you've shown me and my delegation. And on behalf of my country, I want to thank the Malaysian people for the wonderful welcome that you extended to us today.
I'm delighted to make this historic visit. As some of you may know, it has been nearly 50 years since an American President visited Malaysia. In his memoirs, Lyndon Johnson wrote of how impressed he was by the ""extraordinary vitality and eagerness"" he saw in the faces of people here and throughout Southeast Asia. And I'm eager to see that same boleh spirit tomorrow when I have the opportunity to speak with young people from across Southeast Asia at the University of Malaya.
Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to our work together, and I pledge to infuse our efforts with that same spirit. Tonight I simply want to express my gratitude for the generosity that you've shown us today, a generosity the people of Malaysia have extended to my family since I was elected.
As some of you may know, 2 years ago, the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia hosted an exhibit that showcased some of my mother's batik collection. Now, my mother loved batik.I remember when I was a boy growing up in Jakarta, she'd come home from village markets with her arms full of batik, and she'd lay them around the house and look at them and make dresses out of them. And I was a young boy, so I wasn't as excited as she was. [Laughter]
And they weren't particularly fancy or expensive—although, later in life, she would get some antiques that were extraordinary—but for my mother, batik wasn't about fashion. It was representative of the work and the livelihood of mothers and young women who had painstakingly crafted them. It was a window into the lives of others, their cultures and their traditions and their hopes. And it meant so much to her, and it was part of her spirit, and so I'm deeply grateful to the people of Malaysia for celebrating that part of my mother's life. It was very kind of you.
And I tell this story because my mother believed, and I believe, that whether we come from a remote village or a big city, whether we live in the United States or in Malaysia, that we all share basic human aspirations: to live in dignity and peace, to shape our own destiny, to be able to make a living and to work hard and support a family and, most of all, to leave the next generation something better than was left to us.
These are the aspirations that I believe illuminate a new era of partnership—of berkerjasama—between the United States and Malaysia. For while we may be different as nations, our people have similar hopes and similar aspirations. And we can draw strength in both our nations from our ethnic and religious diversity. We can draw hope from our history. And we dream of a brighter future for all of our children.
So I would like to propose a toast: To the strength of our relationship, the power of our friendship, the peace and prosperity of our peoples, and the good health of Their Majesties the King and Queen.
[A toast was offered.]
President Obama. Terima kasih banyak. Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"September 25, 2015","
President Obama. Well, good evening, everyone. On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. President Xi, Madame Peng, members of the Chinese delegation: Once again, I want to welcome you as we honor the ties between our nations and our peoples.
In our visits to China, Michelle and I have experienced the traditions, the culture, the cuisine of a civilization that spans thousands of years. And I understand that in China there's a saying, ""Food is heaven."" [Laughter] I dare not stand in the way of the divine, so I will be brief. [Laughter]
Today President Xi and I agreed to expand our cooperation between our two nations. I know that some—in both countries and around the world—question whether we can sustain the cooperation that we need and the world needs. I think we can draw encouragement from the ties that have long connected our peoples.
I think of the American airmen during the Second World War who went down over China. Chinese villagers sheltered them, fed them, clothed them, and treated their wounds. And decades later, one Chinese man said of the American he saved: ""He is like the thumb on the hand . . . and I am like the finger. . . . We are brothers together.""
I think of the ties that are forged every single day and that we've worked to expand in our work today: American tourists in China visiting the Forbidden City and the Great Wall, Chinese tourists visiting our Statue of Liberty and Independence Hall, our students who cross the Pacific to learn from each other, our scientists who discover new treatments together, our health workers who fought Ebola together.
There will be times where there are differences between our two countries. That's inevitable. There will be times where our interests entirely overlap. But what I think will be sustaining is the friendship between our peoples, the foundation of the ties between our nations. And just as you say in China that a ""sea accepts a hundred rivers,"" our countries together are stronger as—when we accept the diversity and the views and contributions and uphold the rights of all of our peoples.
And so I propose a toast: To the people of China and the people of the United States, may they work together, like fingers on the same hand, in friendship and in peace. Ganbei!
[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]
President Xi. Mr. President and Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: Good evening. It gives me great pleasure to attend this grand dinner. On behalf of the Chinese delegation and in the name of my wife and myself, I wish to extend heartfelt thanks to you, Mr. President, and to Mrs. Obama.
I also extend my cordial greetings to all the friends present and, through you, to all those across American society who take a strong interest in China-U.S. relationship and support its growth. My state visit to the United States is an unforgettable journey. From the West Coast to the East Coast, what strikes me most is that the American people have a lot of good will toward the Chinese people. And they hope much more can be accomplished through enhanced China-U.S. cooperation. I want to assure you that such good will is fully reciprocated by the Chinese people.
Since yesterday evening, I have had three meetings with President Obama. We had candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and the major issues that are vital to world peace and development. And we reached broad and important agreement. Our discussion has yielded many positive outcomes.
Thirty-six years ago, during his visit to the United States, Mr. Deng Xiaoping predicted that China-U.S. relations would make major progress under new, historical conditions. Bracing against wind and rain, our relations have forged ahead and have made extraordinary achievements in the past 30 years and more. I am convinced that the future of U.S.-China relations will be even more bright.
This morning my wife and Mrs. Obama visited the panda house at the National Zoo. [Laughter] She later told me that she was deeply touched by the American kids' love of panda and their curiosity about and a fondness for China, the home of panda. My wife said at the event, the seeds of China-U.S. friendship have already taken root in the hearts of the kids. I cannot agree more with her.
Mr. President and Mrs. Obama, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, as an ancient Chinese saying goes: ""Only those who take actions can achieve their goal. Only those who stride forward can reach their destination."" President Abraham Lincoln once said, ""The best way to predict the future is to create it."" Let us continue to respect and learn from each other, turn our blueprint into reality, and write in a creative way a new, historic chapter in China-U.S. relations.
In closing, let me propose a toast: To the friendship between Chinese and American peoples, to the prosperity of China and the United States and the happiness of our two peoples, and to the health of President and Mrs. Obama and all the friends present. Cheers!
[President Xi offered a toast.]

You ever had the feeling you've been here before? [Laughter]
Governor and Mrs. Romer and distinguished Governors and spouses and our very special guests from around the Nation, Hillary and I are delighted to welcome all of you here to our first state dinner. This is something that I have looked forward to for some time, and as I'm sure you know, I am delighted that this is the first official dinner we're having in the White House. I couldn't be more pleased to see you here.
Many of you were kind enough to come to the luncheon that I hosted, along with Hillary and Vice President Gore and Tipper, for all the Governors and former Governors with whom I had the honor to serve. And I would just like to say tonight on this occasion that I'm looking forward to getting to work with you tomorrow.
This country needs your involvement and your support to deal with the health care crisis, which is threatening to bankrupt many of you; to deal with the budget crisis, which is undermining the economic stability of every State in America; and to seize the opportunities that are out there.
The time I spent as a Governor and the time I spent working with you and those who preceded you was some of the best time I ever spent in my life. I look back on it with great pride and gratitude. And to all of you I say that I honor the work that you must do, and I look forward to being a real partner.
I'm delighted that you're here, and I hope you have a great time tonight as we move from the dinner into the entertainment. I want to say that I expect to have a special treat tonight for you in the entertainment. I think you'll all enjoy it very much.
But please know here that this house is your house, that I am well aware of the fact that I am just a temporary tenant, and that while here I intend to do my very best to be faithful to the lessons that I learned as a Governor that most of what you do ought to be done by you and not by us. And I will try to be a good partner, and I hope you will be mine, as we get this country to face its problems and seize its promise.
I now propose a toast to the Governors and their spouses, friends, and family members.

state-dinners,Gerald R. Ford,"August 02, 1975","
Mr. President, Mrs. Ceausescu, ladies and gentlemen:
My visit to Romania is a very, very great pleasure. Because of summit, high-level meetings between our Governments and the growing number of contacts at the ministerial level, and between officials and specialists at all levels, we have witnessed in recent years improvement in U.S.-Romanian relations.
It seems very fortuitous and unique that within a day following the signing of the agreements in Helsinki that we have reaffirmed and expanded our fine personal relationship, that we have seen concrete evidence of better relations between the Romanian people and the American people, and that we have listened to the words of one of the leaders of the nations in Europe who has been strong and forthright, that we should meet here on this occasion.
Our talks today, Mr. President, reaffirmed in the most positive terms our mutual interest in continuing to build our excellent bilateral relations.
Mr. President, my visit to Europe is of significance for another reason. We both participated in the final stages of the European Security Conference in Helsinki.
As you, Mr. President, have pointed out on many, many occasions, the dynamics of change--social, technological, global, and dimensional--affect all nations. So can and should the results of Helsinki.
We welcome, Mr. President, the changing relationship being forged between East and West. This is a relationship in which Romania continues to assume a most important role. The efforts of the United States and Romania and those of the other [thirty-] three participating nations will be very useful, and deeds equal words.
Not the least result of the Conference has been to show that smaller nations can make an independent, can make an equal and valuable contribution to the world.
While recognizing the importance of the Conference's work, the United States views it as one important step in a continuing process. It is imperative that we work together to lessen the chances for conflict. Let all nations cooperate to lessen human poverty, human suffering, and human hunger.
The challenges we face require the best efforts and the best ideas of all concerned, and all nations must have a positive and active role to play.
Mr. President, my country fully recognizes the growing interdependence of mankind, the need for increased cooperation among the industrialized nations, and a greater recognition of the concerns of the developing nations.
The United States will make full and fair contribution. We look to the other nations of the world to join with us in this important endeavor.
Mr. President, I came to Romania for another very important reason. This complex world is marked by diversity. We recognize the importance of close ties with a country that shows such independence and such vigor. We do not always agree, but we value the courage of a nation that wants to make its contribution to a better world by its own very special efforts.
Romania has won the admiration of the American people for her positive contributions to world understanding. I am confident that Romania will contribute constructively in helping to find practical and durable solutions to the problems of today as well as for tomorrow.
Mr. President, on behalf of Mrs. Ford and myself, I thank you and your very gracious wife for your warm hospitality. I raise my glass to you, Mr. President, and to the building of a more secure and prosperous international community in which both of our peoples will find peace and progress in the future.

state-dinners,Barack Obama,"July 27, 2015","
Prime Minister Hailemariam. Your Excellency, the President of the United States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: In the history of the relationship by Ethiopia and the United States of America, this is an exceptional occasion. Never before did we have the opportunity to be able to welcome a sitting President of the United States for an official visit to Ethiopia.
And, Mr. President, we welcome you and all the members of your delegation to Ethiopia with open arms. Your visit is a mark of the long friendship between our two countries and our two peoples, a friendship that I am certain will be further enhanced in the future. It shows the strengths and depths of the diplomatic and cultural relations we enjoy today and underlines our hopes for the future.
Mr. President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, our links were formally established at the beginning of the last century when a treaty of commerce was signed during the reign of Emperor Menelik and President Theodore Roosevelt administration in 1903. Since then, and even earlier, the United States provided an inspiration for the advancement of science and technology and, indeed, of democracy and good governance.
Ethiopia, similarly, as the only surviving vessel of freedom and independence in Africa, offered an inspiration to many in America. It was a source of an inspiration for a great African American thinker and philosopher, Du Bois, as well as more recently, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And many saw a source of enlightenment in the spirit of Ethiopia. They saw the courageous struggle of Ethiopia as the symbol of the struggle of the whole community of Africans across the world for civil liberty, equality, and freedom.
Ours is a relationship established on the basis of mutual understanding, respect, and dignity and matured in the struggle against fascism. The role of the United States to the struggle can only be described as historic. People all over the country protested against Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. You raised funds and sent medical supplies. People in New York, Harlem, Oklahoma, Texas, and many other cities paraded in support of Ethiopia. Thousands offered to enlist to fight for us. And even after the war, many more came to Ethiopia to help in our post-war reconstruction.
It is perhaps appropriate to single out one person, as I feel this is an appropriate moment to mention one African American hero who grew up in Mississippi during the early 1920s and came to Ethiopia in 1935 to help us in our struggle against fascism and colonial aggression. Colonel John Robinson was, I believe, one of the first Americans to take up arms against fascism. Having earlier established an aviation school in Alabama, Colonel Robinson was largely responsible for founding the Ethiopian Air Force during the Italian invasion. Called here the Brown Condor of Ethiopia, he then became the first commander of the Air Force.
He was a wonderful example of those Americans who did so actively support Ethiopia both in time of peace and conflict. And here, let me also mention the exemplary dedication displayed by your youth in the Peace Corps, both in the 1960s, all over the way through today. In this context, let me also remember all those Americans who have given their lives to Ethiopia, not least the late Congressman Mickey Leland who worked so hard to build the relationship between our two countries on the basis of dignity, faith and hope. He would have very much appreciated this visit as a symbol of the friendship that has been built up over the years and which he did so much to encourage.
We, and indeed other Africans, who owe very real gratitude to your administration and the Members of Congress for the recent renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity Act for another decade. And this bipartisan action by Congress was an impressive example of the way the United States is prepared to assist in the development and growth in Africa. I cannot speak too highly of those Congress women and men who were so active and for so many years in support of this cause. I believe I can see a number of you here today. May I offer my very sincere thanks for your determined efforts. You showed a very real example of the understanding that the people of America have for the problems of Africa.
Your effort also provides another clear demonstration of the way we can and do work together, closely and harmoniously, for joint development of our people.
Mr. President, Excellencies, today we are celebrating a longstanding, time-tested, and exceptional relationship. I believe I can speak for us all when I say that this closeness could now be expressed at a new level of contact and development. The United States, of course, continues to play major role in global efforts for peace and development.
There are the central issues for us as well, and I believe I can say that we have similar views on major regional and global issues. We have been cooperating closely at the United Nations, in the African Union, and in our regional organization, IGAD. We greatly appreciate this support we have received and continue to receive from the United States for the resolution of conflict and peace-building and stability in our region. We are most grateful for your steadfast support to our collective efforts in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism.
Mr. President, with all this in mind, we in Ethiopia would like to infuse a new level of commitment into our relationship with the United States. We have built a firm relationship on the basis of mutual trust and respect, and now we'd like to extend this and raise our links to a new level, to explore further opportunities for development and build a wider network of activity that can strengthen our bilateral relationship. It is something from which I believe we can both benefit.
Mr. President, you have here a very trusted friend, a country and people that highly appreciate what the United States stands for. Now, in the spirit of the friendship, I would therefore like to propose a toast to the bright future that awaits the people of our two countries and to the good health and happiness of Your Excellency.
Distinguished guests, may I ask you to stand and join me in a toast to the President of the United States of America and to all the people of the great nation. Long live Ethiopia-U.S friendship. Cheers.
[At this point, Prime Minister Hailemariam offered a toast.]
President Obama. Thank you so much. Good evening, everybody. I would greet you in all the languages of Ethiopia, but I'm told that there are more than 80. [Laughter] So that would keep us here all night. [Laughter] So let me just say indemin walachu.
Prime Minister Hailemariam and distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: It is a great honor for me to be here tonight as the first sitting United States President to visit Ethiopia. And I want to thank the great people of Ethiopia, including Teddy Mak—he's the one who sang that catchy song upon my welcome. I want to thank all of you for the wonderful reception we've received.
You know Ethiopians are an ancient people in an ancient land. We honor Ethiopia as the birthplace of humankind. In fact, I just met Lucy, our oldest ancestor. [Laughter] As your great poet laureate wrote, ""Here is the land where the first harmony in the rainbow was born. . . . Here is the root of the Genesis of Life; the human family was first planted here.""
When you see our ancestor, 3.5 million years old, we are reminded that Ethiopians, Americans, all the people of the world are part of the same human family, the same chain. And as one of the professors who was describing the artifacts correctly pointed out, so much of the hardship and conflict and sadness and violence that occurs around the world is because we forget that fact. We look at superficial differences as opposed to seeing the fundamental connection that we all share.
And for more than a century, our two nations have enjoyed a harmony that enriched us both. We've worked together to lift up the fortunes of those most in need. Tonight we also remember former Prime Minister Meles and his dedication to reducing poverty. Together, we've sheltered and cared for refugees fleeing conflict. We've sought to secure our shared future against those who would threaten us.
Of course, of the many contributions Ethiopia has made to the world over the centuries, I'm certain that Americans want to thank you for one in particular, discovering something that sustains people around the world, day and night, and many people in the White House, and that is coffee. [Laughter] Thank you, Ethiopia. We are large consumers of coffee in the White House. [Laughter]
And Ethiopia has ignited the imagination of Americans for generations. Before African Americans won their civil rights, many of them were inspired by this country—a nation that never suffered the indignities of colonialism, people who defended their freedom and their right in self-determination. You already mentioned, Mr. Prime Minister, Colonel John Robinson, an American who was one of the fathers of the Tuskegee Airmen, he was nicknamed the Brown Condor, who then came to Ethiopia and trained Ethiopian pilots to tame their heavens and, as you indicated, helped to set up the Ethiopian Air Force. You sparked the passion of American poets like Paul Laurence Dunbar and Langston Hughes, who saw in Ethiopia a dignity to be celebrated and emulated.
Ethiopia kindled a commitment to service for generations of young Americans who volunteered for the Peace Corps and who have for decades worked alongside the people of this proud land. For my part, I was impressed by the courage of the Ethiopian journalist that I welcomed to the White House earlier this year, moved by her determination to champion a robust free press, and I very much appreciated the comments you made at the press conference today about the evolution that's taking place to deepen democracy here.
So the deep connections between our peoples is built on the values that we share. We saw that so clearly 2 years ago when the Boston Marathon suffered that horrendous terrorist bombing. And in a gesture of great solidarity and compassion, the runner who won the race, an Ethiopian, returned his medal to honor the victims of the attack. And at this year's Marathon, Americans cheered all the harder when he once again crossed the finish line first with an even faster time. And that, I think, is the hallmark of the American and Ethiopian bond. We don't give in or give up when things get hard, but we come back better and we come back stronger. So there's no doubt that Ethiopians and Americans are sprung from the same root of life—we have evidence of that. Tonight I'd like to offer a toast: To another century of friendship, to our one human family, and to a bright future for the land where the first harmony of the rainbow was born. Letenachin. For you Americans, that means ""to our health"" or ""cheers."" [Laughter]
Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"October 12, 1982","
President Reagan. Well, tonight, we welcome good friends back to the White House, friends who have been too long absent.
In the years since your last visit, President Soeharto, much has transpired in your country and in ours, and in Asia and the Pacific, where we both share so many interests. Yet, during these dynamic and often turbulent years, there have been elements of stability, important elements.
Foremost among these has been the wise and steadfast leadership which you have given Indonesia since 1966. Out of a period of uncertainty and disorder, you have guided your country into the forefront of the Asian community of nations and made its influence felt throughout the world.
You will pardon me I hope, Mr. President, if I recognize here tonight what is already apparent to the nations of the world—that Indonesia, under your leadership, has assumed its rightful position as a great nation of Asia and of the world.
The second factor of stability since the 1960's, Mr. President, has been the excellent bilateral relations which have existed between Indonesia and the United States. Our relationship has stood the test of time in a changing world. It's firmly rooted in mutual respect and a clear-sighted recognition of where the interests of both our nations lie.
Mr. President, I fully share the importance that you attach to the further strengthening and expansion of the relationship between our two countries. To that end, it is my pleasure to announce tonight my decision to nominate as my personal representative to your government someone well known to you, and in whom I have the utmost confidence, Assistant Secretary John H. Holdridge.
As you are aware, Assistant Secretary Holdridge is our most senior diplomat experienced in East Asian affairs. In commending him to the Senate for its advice and consent, I shall do so assured that no one is better qualified to continue, on my behalf, the frank and mutually beneficial dialog which has marked your visit here, and which is so essential to the advancement of mutual understanding between our two countries and the achievement of our common purposes.
During our most fruitful discussions today, I've had the benefit of your experience and insight. You've clearly outlined the great challenges facing your country, the Association of South East Asian Nations, and the other nations of Asia which seek to live in peace. I come away from our talks more convinced than ever that we share this common view: that the greatest need for the countries of Southeast Asia is for rapid, equitable development free from outside interference and in an atmosphere of peaceful change.
I also appreciated your views on the situation in the Middle East. The special interests of both our nations in that troubled region make it imperative that peace be pursued vigorously. Lasting solutions will not come easily, however, and I earnestly ask that all nations support efforts in this pursuit of peace.
In our talks, we devoted much attention to global economic recovery. I'm convinced the world economic conditions will improve with national self-restraint and sound financial management for continued growth. These qualities have characterized Indonesia's economic policies since 1966 and serve as a persuasive example for other nations of the developing world.
I would also take note of the important role which Indonesia plays in the Association of South East Asian Nations. In our view, ASEAN offers the best hope for the fulfillment of national aspirations in the region, and it provides an important example of common purpose for us all.
Finally, I wish to compliment the wide range of charitable and humanitarian programs inspired by Madam Soeharto.
Nancy and I personally wish you both good health and the utmost success in realizing the aspirations of your people.
President Soeharto. Your Excellency, Mr. President, and Mrs. Reagan, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, once again, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the warm welcome and hospitality accorded me during my present visit to the United States in accepting the invitation of Your Excellency, Mr. President.
Your kind words, Your Excellency, have impressed me as indication of the close friendly relation and mutual understanding between our two countries. As I have said this morning, Your Excellency, the main purpose of my current visit is to reiterate the friendship between our two countries.
Your Excellency, Mr. President, the friendship between our two countries has a solid foundation because of the similarity of our two nations with regard to the noble values which we hold dearly—such as freedom and independence, democracy and humanitarianism. We perceive the manifestation of such friendship from the deep understanding and support of the American nation when we struggled for and defended our national independence 37 years ago. We acknowledge such deep understanding again are, among other things, the willingness of the United States, together with other IGGI [Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia] countries a dozen of years ago, to assist our economic and social development.
For all this, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to extend once again the highest appreciation of the Government and people of Indonesia to the Government and people of the United States of America.
We consider that the problem of development that we face is also actually a part of the problem of the human race. If until now, two-thirds of the human race are still striving in the struggle against poverty, backwardness, ignorance, and disease, this clearly indicates the real situation of what I have said earlier. It is, therefore, necessary to create an international climate that enables the unhindered development of all nations. But today such a climate is still far from expectation. Today the world is suffering from a long, drawn out economic recession beside the upheavals occurring in various regions.
Indeed, there have been many efforts made to overcome these various disturbances. But the outcome has not ensured its total solution. In the framework of trying to find a fundamental solution and to achieve an overall improvement of the inequalities in the world, the one and only answer is that all nations, big or small, strong or weak, strive together, motivated by the firm determination to build a new world order which guarantees political justice, economic justice, and social justice.
Unavoidably, it must be the common stand and concerted efforts of all nations on our unitary planet, because with the growingly closer relation amongst nations, due to the progress brought about by the human civilization at present and in the future, whether we like it or not, we must consider the world as the common homeland of all nations.
I'm aware that it is not easy to build a new world order. There must be, therefore, concrete steps which will at least prevent the deterioration of world developments, which may cause our solitary world to fall into the abyss of greater disaster, which may probably terminate the history of man and mankind. In such a world situation, filled with anxiety, obviously the world's attention, particularly of the developing countries, is focused for its umpteenth time on the United States.
We hope and believe that under the wise leadership of Your Excellency, Mr. President, the United States will try unceasingly to create world stability and peace and to prevent catastrophe to the human race. The strengths of this great nation, its glorious past history, its commitments to mankind, provide ample chance to the United States to play an important role in the endeavors of the whole of mankind to create a stable, peaceful, and prosperous world.
It is primarily to carry the common responsibility of creating such a world that I consider as highly significant the exchange of views that I have had with Your Excellency, Mr. President, and other American leaders during my current visit. I am convinced that my present visit will further reinforce the friendship, enhance the mutual understanding, and expand the cooperation between our two countries, particularly in the economic field.
In conclusion, permit me to kindly invite the distinguished guests to raise your glass and join me in a toast to the health and happiness of His Excellency, Mr. President, and Mrs. Reagan, to the prosperity of the people of the United States of America, and to the everlasting friendship between our two countries.
Thank you.

state-dinners,Richard Nixon,"June 14, 1974","
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Your Excellencies, and distinguished guests:
Your Majesty, speaking for all of us here who are your guests from the United States, I express appreciation for this magnificent dinner and also for your very gracious remarks.
This is indeed a very historic visit as far as I personally am concerned and as far as the United States is concerned, because, of the five nations that we are visiting on this journey for peace through the Mideastern area, Saudi Arabia has the longest record of unbroken friendship with the United States of all those nations. And while I have had the opportunity on several occasions to receive not only Your Majesty but others representing your country in the United States and to meet and talk to you there, I am honored that this is the first visit of an American President to Saudi Arabia.
And I believe that it is important and significant to point out to all of those assembled here that this visit is not one that is necessary because of any differences we have in a bilateral sense, because as Your Majesty pointed out and as Prince Fahd's recent visit to the United States1 underlined, we have embarked on new areas of cooperation in the economic and security fields which we are sure will serve the interests of not only our two countries but the interest of peace in this part of the world.
We live in a very decisive time in the history of world diplomacy. Over these past 3 years, we have seen the United States of America establish a new relationship with the People's Republic of China, where one-fourth of all the people in the world live. We have seen the end of America's longest and most difficult war in Vietnam. We have had a series of meetings with the leaders of the Soviet Union to resolve differences and develop, where possible, areas of cooperation for peaceful purposes.
But I would be certainly much less than candid if I were not to admit that despite these advances in the cause of peace, we know how difficult and long the road ahead is if we are to have a permanent peace.
I think, for example, of His Majesty's background, the fact that when he was only 14 years of age he attended a conference at the end of World War I, a war that was described at that time as one that would end all wars. But that, of course, was not the case. Versailles left only the seeds for a war that was to follow in the next generation.
And then His Majesty attended another conference after the Second World War in San Francisco, the conference that set up the U.N. And yet with all the high idealism that motivated so many of those who attended that conference, it did not produce a framework which guaranteed what so many wanted, a lasting peace, because wars continued to come.
And that is why, to the extent that we can contribute to a great goal, our goal is not simply a peace that will be an interlude between wars but a peace that can last, and such a peace must be built carefully, step by step, having in mind the fact that if mistakes are made in the making of the peace, the result inevitably will be simply another conflict.
So, I can say tonight that while we do have a new and promising relation with the People's Republic of China, while we do have a dialog discussing many constructive items with the Soviet Union, we realize that the process of peace is one that never ends. We must continue to work in order to preserve it.
And that brings me, of course, to the area of the world in which we are most interested at this time--the Mideast. We want to play a helpful role. And our Secretary of State, we believe, has played a helpful role working with the governments in the area to settle longtime differences. But we are aware that we cannot produce an instant formula to solve all longtime differences. But what is new in the present situation is that the United States is playing a role, a positive role, working toward the goal of a permanent peace in the Mideast.
And it is for this reason, Your Majesty, that this visit to Saudi Arabia, clearly apart from the very great pleasure it gives us to see you personally again and to see so many of our friends, it is for this reason that this visit is important. Because over the past 27 years, I have had the privilege of meeting and knowing the leaders of over 80 nations in the world.
And I can assure all of those assembled here that in terms of years of experience, in terms of wisdom, in terms of vision, not only for his own country and his own area but for the whole world, there is no man on the world scene who can surpass our host tonight, His Majesty King Faisal.
I know that most people--at least, it is assumed that most people come to Saudi Arabia to get oil. We can use oil. But we need more, something that is worth far more than oil. We need wisdom.
And that is why I am sure that the talks that His Majesty and I have already been privileged to have and that we will continue tomorrow, will help me, help the Secretary of State in our developing the policies and developing the programs that can continue the momentum toward the goal that we all seek, a just and lasting peace for the people of the Mideast and all of the nations in this area.
And finally, just to demonstrate that I am somewhat of a practical politician, let me say that while we will treasure most the wisdom that we will take with us after this visit, we, of course, will need the oil to carry us to our next stop.
And, Your Majesty, I just want to make clear, we, of course, will pay the world price.

state-dinners,George W. Bush,"May 07, 2007","
President Bush. Your Majesty and Your Royal Highness, distinguished guests: Laura and I offer you a warm welcome to the White House. We are really glad you're here.
Tonight is the fourth state dinner held in Your Majesty's honor here at the White House. On previous such occasions, you've been welcomed by President Eisenhower, President Ford, and another President named Bush. [Laughter] Over your long reign, America and Britain have deepened our friendship and strengthened our alliance.
Our alliance is rooted in the beliefs that we share. We recognize that every individual has dignity and matchless value. We believe that the most effective governments are those that hold themselves accountable to their people. And we know that the advance of freedom is the best hope for lasting peace in our world.
Based on our common values, our two nations are working together for the common good. Together, we are supporting young democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Together, we're confronting global challenges such as poverty and disease and terrorism. And together, we're working to build a world in which more people can enjoy prosperity and security and peace.
Friendships remain strong when they are continually renewed, and the American people appreciate Your Majesty's commitment to our friendship. We thank you for helping us celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown settlement. We're confident that Anglo-American friendship will endure for centuries to come.
So, on behalf of the American people, I offer a toast to Your Majesty, to Your Royal Highness, and to our staunch allies, the valiant people of the United Kingdom.
Queen Elizabeth II. Thank you very much, indeed.
President Bush. Your turn, Your Majesty.

state-dinners,George Bush,"December 07, 1990","
Mr. President, thank you for those very kind words and a very important speech. It is wonderful to be back in this great nation and this lovely city of Caracas. I well remember my last visit to Venezuela, a much more somber occasion. I was in your country as Vice President in December of 1981 to pay my respects to a great founding father and defender of Venezuelan democracy, Romulo Betancourt.
Now, 9 years later, there is cause to rejoice, for the vision of Betancourt and Carlos Andres Perez is being realized in the Americas. Just look at what's happened in one decade: Democracy has been restored in Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, Chile, and Paraguay, leaving Cuba as the lonely totalitarian holdout in our hemisphere. So, we are close, very close, to a democratic hemisphere, from Alaska to Argentina. And I am here today to declare that this era of peaceful change came about, in no small part, because of the unwavering leadership and example of a democratic Venezuela.
Like President Betancourt, you, Mr. President, have been a creative democratic leader. Like Simon Bolivar, you have carried on a legacy as a standard-bearer of liberty. Mr. President -- CAP, to me and many other leaders in this hemisphere -- [laughter] -- those who love freedom in the Americas know that you and Venezuela are always on their side. And it's because of your leadership that we're seeing, once again, that freedom at the ballot box inevitably leads to freedom in the marketplace, that free political systems and free enterprise go hand in hand -- just one more reason why Venezuela's future is as limitless as your people's industry and imagination.
I know that the economic reform program that you launched upon taking office has been, at times, difficult. But you've stayed true to principle, and you stayed true to Venezuela's future -- a future of prosperity and democracy.
The good relations that exist between my government and yours are especially welcome because my family, the Bush family, has had a close connection to Venezuela. Our son Jeb lived and worked here in Caracas not so many years ago. And I certainly know firsthand how important Venezuela's leadership is to my country and how a prosperous and democratic Venezuela is essential to our hemispheric community. And that is why I especially look forward to cooperating closely with Venezuela in carrying out our Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.
It is my hope that the day will be brought closer when, as Simon Bolivar wrote in 1818, all of the New World can assume a place ""with a description of majesty and grandeur unprecedented in the Old World.""
And so, with a heart full of gratitude and thanks, let me close with a toast to President Perez and the Venezuelan people. I believe it will be recognized and appreciated here: ""Manos a la obra!"" [Let's get on with it!]

Ladies and gentlemen, President Robinson, Mr. Robinson, members of the Irish delegation, Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, distinguished guests. Welcome to the largest gathering of Irish-Americans since the last Notre Dame football game. [Laughter]
Hillary and I were hoping that we might with this wonderful dinner tonight in some small way repay President Robinson and the people of Ireland for the wonderful reception that we and our American delegation received there late last year. It was, I think it's fair to say, two of the most extraordinary days in the lives of all of us who went. And we hope now to give a similar honor to the extraordinary President of Ireland.
From the beginning of her career in public life—and she was elected to the Seanad at the age of 25—Mary Robinson has stood unfailingly for those on the margins of society, for those without a voice in public affairs, for those most in need, for the rights of women and the care of the children at home and around the world. She said, ""You have a voice; I will make it heard."" And she has. And Ireland has heeded her strong and compassionate call, and indeed the entire world has applauded her leadership.
We are truly glad you are here, Madam President, especially at this moment when Ireland is thriving, stronger, more prosperous, and prouder than at any time in its rich history. Modern Ireland has stepped forward as a nation whose goods are traded around the world and whose music, movies, and literature are treasures of global culture. And Ireland is playing an even greater role on the world stage to the benefit of nations everywhere. Indeed, every day for the last 40 years, somewhere in the world an Irish citizen has worked for peace and humanity.
In the North, though the way is not always easy, a lasting and peaceful settlement is closer than at any time in memory, in good measure because Ireland has worked so steadfastly for every chance for peace.
The friendship between the United States is stronger than ever. Indeed, friendship is an inadequate word for the relationship between two nations as intertwined as ours. From the earliest times of our history, the Irish have been at the heart of our striving to be a better nation. By supporting Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, Irish immigrants helped to prod America to improve and broaden the reach of our democracy. They stood unflinchingly for freedom all the way. Two hundred thousand Irish-Americans fought in our Civil War, the most costly part of our journey toward a more perfect Union.
While the Irish made their presence felt in America, we like to believe America's presence was felt in Ireland as well. Ideas about selfgovernment that developed here were carried across the ocean and espoused by leaders like Wolfe Tone, Daniel O'Connell, and Charles Stewart Parnell. The devotion of Irish-Americans to the cause of Irish liberty and their support of the Irish state is renowned here at home and around the world.
Today we celebrate all these ties and others that go to the deepest part of our life and character as a nation. But we cannot imagine America without the Irish-Americans. Whether in business or politics, the arts or entertainment, or making the life of every community in this country a little stronger, they have graced our country in immeasurable ways.
President Robinson, in 1916 Patrick Pearse, the Irish poet and patriot, described Irish-Americans as the ""sea-divided Gael."" It was a haunting phrase from a year of bloodshed. Tonight we see that on both sides of the sea the Irish are flourishing. The love and joy that unites us is far, far broader and stronger than the sea which divides us.
So ladies and gentlemen, let us all raise a glass to the partnership of Ireland and America, to the extraordinary community of Irish-Americans for which we are so grateful, and to the President of Ireland and her health, well-being, and the future of her beloved country.

General Torrijos, President Lakas, President Perez, President Michelsen, President Carazo, Prime Minister Manley, distinguished [fiends from Panama and the United States:
It's a great pleasure for me to be in a country where people are so hospitable and friendly, where the President has the first name of Jimmy and the Foreign Minister is a graduate of the University of Georgia, and where the Chief of State is the only person in the world that knows better than I do the Senators of the United States. [Laughter]
I noticed tonight that when he has not met the Senators before, as soon as he hears their voice, he knows who it is. [Laughter] We've brought the Senators with good voices. [Laughter]
We have found the Panamanian negotiators and their Chief of State to be tough, prudent, fair, tenacious, friendly, and gracious.
As we move toward a time of increased friendship, equality, and partnership, many people in the United States have taken the time and effort to learn more about Panama. We have learned about the pride of the people, their dignity, and we've seen at first hand now the tremendous new investment, under this administration, in those who in the past have been deprived and poor.
We have seen the rapid development of the poor in the rural and urban areas and the heavy investment that has been made in alleviating hunger here, increasing the economic well-being of the people, and the heavy emphasis on better health care and better education. Primary education is available to all, and the enrollment in the schools increased, at one time, 80 percent in just 3 years.
I grew up on a farm in Georgia that did not have running water, and I've observed the statistics that show that formerly less than 50 percent of the people in this country had running, fresh water. Now more than 85 percent are scheduled to have this very basic need filled by the year 1980.
General Torrijos has a great slogan. He wants to do away with the class struggle and have a classroom struggle instead.
We in the United States know that the world is changing. We've recognized this fact by establishing a new relationship with our longtime friend and neighbor, Panama. And I believe that we have now seen the clear need to recognize the innate and sacred sovereignty of the people in this great country, to reaffirm our commitment to the principle of nonintervention, and to face the future with a realization of the benefits to us as well as to Panama from a new partnership that has now been formed.
My friend Omar Torrijos and I have decided to serve our nations in a time without challenge and without difficulty. [Laughter]
We have been successful, I believe, in convincing the people of both nations that the difficult decisions that have been made were the proper ones. And the reception today is a vivid demonstration, beyond anything we had anticipated or had hoped for, that there is a deep and abiding friendship among the Panamanian people for those of the United States. And we share the same feeling for your people, General Torrijos.
The years ahead will not be easy. There will inevitably be differences of opinion, and perhaps the partnership which we celebrate this evening will have its trying moments. But with the foundation of friendship and mutual trust and good will and easy communication between us, there is no doubt in my mind that we can protect and preserve the Panama Canal for the benefit of our people and for the benefit of the world and minimize those differences that might otherwise cause dissension among our people.
I look forward to this coming time, and I believe that we can avoid any challenge to this commitment which we have made together.
After the interpreter repeats my next toast, I would like for us to drink to General Torrijos for his patience and determination, to President Lakas for his leadership which inspired the Panamanian people to approve the terms of the treaty, to the people of this great country for their sense of equality and their sense of trust and their willingness to assume a new partnership, to the leaders and people of Latin America, and to the principles which bind us together—liberty, dignity, equality, mutual respect, peace, and permanent friendship.

Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Cheney, Madam Speaker, Members of Congress, Justices of the Supreme Court, members of my Cabinet, honored guests: Laura and I are so pleased to welcome you to the White House.
Every year on Columbus Day, we remember the remarkable history that unites America and Italy. That history began more than five centuries ago when an Italian explorer sighted land after a long ocean voyage. Many believed Christopher Columbus had reached the Far East, but another Italian explorer helped show otherwise. Amerigo Vespucci's journeys revealed that the land was a new world, and America will always be proud to carry his name.
Through the years, generations of Italian immigrants have made their own voyage to the New World. They brought with them a vibrant culture and a strong sense of family. And today, their children and grandchildren have risen to some of the highest offices in our land. Among our guests tonight is the first Italian American Speaker of the House, and first woman, Nancy Pelosi. And we're also honored to be joined by the first Italian American Justices of the United States Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito.
The ties between the people of America and the people of Italy run deep, and the friendship between our countries has never been stronger. The United States and Italy are standing together against the forces of tyranny and terror. We're partnering to meet the challenges in our economies and expand trade and prosperity. And we share a vision of a future of freedom and hope for all the people.
Mr. Prime Minister, you're a strong leader. I admire your enterprising spirit, your visionary leadership, and your commitment to your word. I've enjoyed serving with you on the world stage. I'm honored to call you a close friend.
And it is now my privilege to offer a toast to the Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi.

Your Excellency, it's always a great pleasure to join old friends again. And just as delightful, it's exhilarating to celebrate the stirrings of spring with a visit to your lovely country, as I did in 1981 and '85. I'm looking forward to returning again next spring for the economic summit that Canada will host in 1988. You know, when I started out from Washington, I had the feeling that I was the first political figure this year who left Washington flying north who wasn't going to New Hampshire. [Laughter] The truth is, I feel an extra kinship with Canada on this trip. For me, too, it was a long winter. [Laughter]
It's commonplace at gatherings such as this to reflect on our similarities, of all that we share together. Surely one such experience is that of a sense of great adventure, of opening a new land, of beginning anew and for the good of us all. Your Excellency, as pioneers of this great continent, the citizens of our two countries have shared, and continue to share, a faith in progress, a belief in cooperation and hard work, and a vision of a future free of war and want. Ours are optimistic people, ingrained with the confidence that no problem is insoluble. Together, we faced the ultimate challenge to peace and freedom during the two great world conflicts of this century. Today, in NATO and in NORAD and in our consultation at the economic summit, the G-7, the United Nations, and a host of other cooperative endeavors, we continue to stand together for freedom and democracy and for the economic advancement of mankind.
Just as the frontier once stretched before the trappers and frontiersmen who surveyed and opened the North American Continent, today we face challenges that require courage, commitment, good sense, and intellect. As we hurtle toward the 21st century, we're confident that the future is on the side of the free and that, with God's grace, the greatest days of Canada and the United States are still ahead. Economic challenges are, of course, always present. Prosperity, economic advancement, improving the lot of large numbers of people is no easy task. Critical choices will determine if our children and grandchildren are to live well and possess the same opportunity we've enjoyed. It comes down to this: How can Canada and the United States, mature industrial powers, best meet the competition and remain the business, commercial, and industrial leaders of the 21st century?
Mr. Prime Minister, your proposal that we cooperate, that we combine and draw upon the collective energy of two economies, was bold and farsighted. It has opened an historic prospect. Setting the goals, however, is easier than achieving them. Our intense negotiations to bring a comprehensive free trade agreement into being certainly suggest this. There is still much hard bargaining ahead, yet let us not lose sight of the grandeur of what we seek. We remain hopeful that we can conclude an agreement this year. And if we do, it will be an agreement that will promote the economic prosperity of both countries—fair, equitable, and mutually beneficial.
This trade agreement will send a number of messages. First and foremost, it is a resounding ""no"" to those who would stand pat, to the naysayers, and to the fearful who advocate protectionist barriers. It is a resounding vote of confidence in our own abilities to meet world competition with an unleashed ingenuity, which is prized on both sides of the 49th parallel. It's an exciting idea, and it's a real possibility within our reach. It can reinforce the already impressive strength of our economic relationship. The free flow of goods, services, and investment will be an impetus to sustained economic growth, a trump card in resolving the economic difficulties of today. So, let's look forward to the day when our California wines, toasted the world over, are available throughout Canada without hindrance for your dining delight— [laughter] —just as Molson's Ale is available to every American table. The children of today will enjoy the fruits of our labor in many ways, not the least of which is strengthening the enduring ties between our peoples.
Thank you, and God bless you.
And now, to Her Excellency, the Governor General of Canada, to Mr. Sauve, would you join me in a toast?

The President. It's been a pleasure for Nancy and me to welcome to Washington today His Highness Shaykh Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa, the Amir of Bahrain.
Your Highness, in view of the long history of technical cooperation our two countries have enjoyed, I can think of no more appropriate guests tonight than our five astronauts from the space shuttle Challenger. The members of that crew typify the highest American accomplishments, both in technical skill and teamwork, which benefit all of mankind. And the teamwork between our two countries, Your Highness, has led to growth, prosperity, and development of human and natural resources. We must draw on our foundation of partnership as we search for stability and peace with justice in the Middle East.
I'd like to restate the commitment of the American people to fulfilling our role as a loyal friend and cooperative partner to Bahrain. As an island country, Bahrain has prospered by reaching outward. You have been especially sensitive to the ebb and flow of international events while others were content to look inward. Your recent economic accomplishments have been the result of hard work and effective government, but they also reflect your personal imagination and leadership. That same vision has made you, Your Highness, a leader in the cooperative effort with your friends to strengthen the security of your region.
We in America understand the importance of maintaining steady economic growth in an uncertain world so that the lives of the Bahraini people can continue to improve. The United States stands ready to consult with you on whatever we can do to participate more fully in your remarkable economic and social progress. I'm particularly pleased that you'll be meeting with Secretary of Treasury Regan to discuss the world economic outlook.
As in the days when it was known as Dilman, Bahrain is a crossroad for the cultures of the globe. As a banking and financial center, an important ship-repair port and site of international petrochemical and metallurgic cooperative ventures, your country is an open and inviting land of growth and opportunity where Arabs and Westerners can freely share their lives and views. As such, Bahrain contributes immeasurably to peace and mutual understanding.
Americans deeply respect your personal courage and vision, Your Highness. We've seen you guide your people with confidence through a turbulent period in the history of the Gulf, never sacrificing your personal commitment to a humane and just society.
Your Highness, I salute you. The American people are fortunate to have you as a friend and proud to stand side by side with the people of Bahrain in seeking stability, prosperity, and peace for us all. Thank you very much, and on behalf of the American people, it's been my pleasure to welcome you to Washington and to the White House.
The Amir. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen:
Our initial delight in visiting this friendly country has been greatly increased during our useful meeting with you, Mr. President, this morning. Our discussions with Senator Charles Percy and his colleagues today were informative and positive. We are sure that two more happy days are awaiting us.
Thank you, Mr. President, for your invitation to us tonight and for the kind words you have spoken about Bahrain and its people. Needless to say, that we have always admired the enterprising spirit of the American people. Today, we in the Gulf are enjoying many of the fruits of their achievement in all field—notably in science and technology.
Mr. President, you will be pleased to know of two similarities between American past and the Gulf present. Firstly, two centuries ago, 13 British colonies succeeded in building a free and strong nucleus of future America. Two years ago, 6 Arab States of the Gulf decided to follow a similar path of cooperation and ultimate unity. If your 13 managed to survive and later increase, surely our 6 must have an equal chance.
Secondly, like your country—that's so an awaking of the American mind during and immediately following the Jacksonian era-the Arab States of the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] are the scene of growing activities in the field of economy, industry, social services, education, communication, and culture. We are confident that the help and understanding of our friends will make the aspiration of our people and the process of achieving those aspiration peaceful for all mankind.
However, Mr. President, there is one notable difference so far: We have not been offered to buy a Louisiana or an Alaska. [Laughter] The oil money seems unable to match the American gold. [Laughter]
We are, indeed, happy and proud that Astronaut Crippen and his colleagues are among us tonight. They surely deserve a decent, earthly meal. [Laughter] We hope that, while cruising in outer space, they noted an island that swam in a sea of spilled oil. For their information, that was Bahrain. [Laughter] We take this opportunity to salute their daring skill and achievement. God bless you all. Thank you very much.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"June 08, 1999","
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House. And a special welcome to President and Mrs. Goncz, members of the Hungarian delegation.
Exactly 150 years ago, in 1849, a young Congressman from Illinois, serving his first and only term in the U.S. House of Representatives, offered a resolution supporting the Hungarian people's struggle for independence and democracy. At that time, the leader of the Hungarian freedom movement, of course, was Lajos Kossuth. The Congressman was Abraham Lincoln. The bonds between our citizens, based not only on the large number of distinguished Hungarian-Americans in our country but also on our shared aspirations for freedom and democracy, have very deep roots.
I would like to say a special word of thanks to Congressman Tom and Annette Lantos, and others who have helped them, because they are responsible for the fact that a bust of Kossuth now stands in the rotunda of our Capitol. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him ""the angel of freedom."" He was only the second non-American— Lafayette being the first—to address both Houses of Congress. Crowds greeted him wherever he went. He was a true American hero.
Mr. President, like Kossuth, you taught yourself English while you were in prison, at a time when you had just escaped a death sentence and faced a life term because you stood for liberty. Later, you translated the works of many great writers: Edith Wharton, Thomas Wolfe, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Arthur Miller, James Baldwin, John Updike, Alice Walker. And at least two I think are here tonight, William Styron and Susan Sontag. These translations offered Hungarians a window on the West and earned you many admirers at home. This work is just one part, but it is a vital part, of your contribution to ending the division of Europe.
I even noted in preparing for this that you translated into Hungarian President Bush's 1988 campaign biography, ""Looking Forward."" [Laughter] Now by the time Al Gore and I published our book, ""Putting People First,"" in 1992, you were already President of Hungary and unfortunately too busy to translate this profoundly important work. [Laughter] At least, I choose to believe that is the reason you did not choose to translate it. [Laughter]
In this decade, your own works have been translated and published in English, your plays performed in the United States. They are a brave set of explorations of political conflict and war, freedom and betrayal, the struggle for daily survival and dignity in the face of adversity. Americans have absorbed these works as we have watched you lead your nation, deepening freedom there and promoting human rights and ethnic tolerance around the world and especially in your own region. The only Hungarian head of state to make an official visit to Romania in this century, you told the joint session of Parliament there that ethnic minorities enrich their nations and form a valuable connective link in strengthening relations between nations.
Your vision of people living together and nations living together, resolving differences peacefully, drawing strength from their diversity, treating all people with equal dignity, this will form the basis of a better future for Europe and the world. It is at the heart of what we have been trying to do in our efforts to reverse ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and to build a southeastern Europe in which all people can live together in dignity and freedom.
Now, Mr. President, normally when I propose a toast to a visiting head of state, I say something like ""cheers."" I have been advised by the State Department that the Hungarian word for ""cheers"" is, and I want to quote from the memo I got—[laughter]—""practically impossible to pronounce correctly."" [Laughter] I have accepted their considered judgment. [Laughter] So, instead, I would like to salute you and Mrs. Goncz with the words that greeted Kossuth on streamers all across New York City on the day he arrived in America: Isten Hozta. Welcome.
I ask all of you to join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Goncz and to the people of Hungary. Thank you very much.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"December 30, 1977","
THE FIRST SECRETARY. Dear Mr. President, dear Mrs. Carter, ladies and gentlemen:
I wish to express, Mr. President, our satisfaction of your visit to Poland. I rest assured that together with the highest authorities of the Polish People's Republic, it is indeed shared by the entire people of Poland.
We take great pleasure in seeing Mrs. Carter in our midst. We also welcome prominent members of the party accompanying you on this visit.
In your visit, Mr. President, we see a reaffirmation of the friendly feelings of the American people for the people of Poland and a reflection of the intentions to further expand cooperation between our two countries. Indeed, these feelings and intentions enjoy our full reciprocity as the expansion of Polish-American cooperation remains in keeping with the tradition of friendship between our two peoples.
It is in the interest of our two countries. It helps deepen detente and shape up constructive international relations. Rich and noble are the traditions we jointly refer to. Poles were among the first settlers on the American soil. In the American struggle for independence, a splendid chapter has been written by Kosciuszko, Pulaski, and other great Polish patriots, for whom the cause of freedom of their own land was inseparably linked with that of all peoples.
It can be assumed with all certainty that from the outset of and all through the Bicentennial of the United States, which, along with the American people, we marked here with friendly observances, a significant share to the expansion of the American economy, civilization, and culture has been contributed by Poles.
We are glad that today the overwhelming majority of the multimillion masses of Americans of Polish extraction as good United States citizens keep maintaining their sentimental and cultural ties with the land of their ancestors, that they wish favorable development of cooperation with the Polish People's Republic. The people of Poland are also cognizant of our common struggle in the great anti-Nazi coalition.
Mr. President, I trust that the paramount cause guiding us mutually is the consolidation of peace. The Polish people in particular only too well know both its price and value, for wasn't it so that the city of Warsaw--which we have risen from the ashes--had been doomed to total extinction? For its heroic resistance, for its contribution for the victory of nations over the fascists, our nation paid the price-of more than 6 million human lives, of the loss of over 40 percent of the national wealth.
It paid the price of most cities turned to ruins and thousands of villages reduced to ashes. The memory of those tragic experiences impressed forever in the Polish minds and hearts imposes the loftiest of obligations upon us to do all in our power to ensure security and peaceful development.
It is with lasting peace, the joy of which we want to share with all other countries of Europe and the world, that we are linking our aspirations, our plans and expectations, for today and for tomorrow. Hence, it is only natural and understandable, Mr. President, that we view with due attention and support warmly actions which serve that great and supreme cause to all nations.
The key factor of the process of detente we perceive in relations between your country, Mr. President, and the Soviet Union. The dialog between the two big powers determines the climate, the overall climate, of international relations in saving mankind from a nuclear holocaust.
This is why theirs is a special responsibility for world peace. Hence, our profound satisfaction over the incipient progress in the talks on offensive strategic arms limitation. Hence our hopes, in fact shared by the broadest public opinion, for a prompt new agreement, as well as for positive results of discussions between the two powers on other important questions.
Together with its Socialist allies and friends, Poland spares no effort to consolidate the process of detente and make it irreversible, for detente is the only alternative. It indeed represents a great chance of our times. Its proper utilization depends in particular on containing the arms race, which weighs heavily upon international relations, wastes economic resources, and poses great threats.
I am sure you are aware, Mr. President, that Poland has always attached special significance to preventing proliferation of nuclear armaments. We have been advancing our own initiatives to this effect, which have enjoyed general recognition.
Today, when the danger of proliferation of those armaments and the introduction of new kinds of weapons of mass destruction is greater than ever before, we are bound to appeal for moderation for the containment of the dangerous phenomenon, for the strengthening and extension of the system of treaties to protect against it.
Remembering, as we do, what you, yourself, Mr. President, have been saying on that matter, we trust it will be given the maximum of attention. By the same token, we lend our full support to the initiative made by Leonid Brezhnev to conclude an agreement to mutually renounce the production of neutron weapons.
Poland proceeds from the principle of full and integrated implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the Final Act of the Helsinki conference, which we treat as the magna carta of peace in Europe. Guided by its principles, we are favorably shaping up our bilateral relations with all states, signatories of the Final Act to take efforts to achieve positive results of the Belgrade meeting.
Progress in the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe would, too, no doubt, serve to strengthen the general sense of security.
There is much to be said, Mr. President, of the climate of international relations. There is need for mutual understanding and trust; only in such circumstances there can be progress in constructive and friendly international cooperation.
Dear Mr. President, we are glad that you share our desire of continuation of the positive processes in Polish-American relations. Our constructive discussions today have confirmed this.
In recent years, important joint statements, agreements, and contracts were signed between our two countries. They do provide a good basis for further mutually beneficial cooperation. Our economic relations have dynamically expanded. As you know, we attach special significance to them and wish to continue expanding them. Our scientific and technical exchanges have grown, constantly enriching is our cultural cooperation, as is the growing tourist traffic, more frequent, our contact serving to get our respective nations to know better and bring them closer together.
It gives me satisfaction to expect that your visit will effect in a further growth of Polish-American cooperation.
Mr. President, we are sorry you are visiting us for such a short time. We would certainly wish that you could get to know our country better, a country of great progress and, at the same time, still overcoming century-old underdevelopment.
Following the gravest tragedy in its own history, our nation has made a choice which offers it lasting safeguards of independence, sovereignty, and security, which provides for the best premises for development. These premises comprise its own ever more growing potential of present day Poland, its alliances with the Soviet Union and .other friends.
Today Poland belongs to the group of countries of the world which are having the greatest development scale as far as production in industry is concerned. And for the last 7 years, we are maintaining very high indices of further growth.
There has been a tremendous revival, biological revival, of our people. in the current decade, the age of maturity is being reached by 7 million of young Polish girls and boys. We ensure to all of them education and work. We have created just, democratic, socio-political conditions. We are implementing the fullest possible code of socio-economic and political rights.
In maintaining and cultivating all what has been most precious in our national tradition, we are enriching contemporary life of Poles by new, profoundly humanistic contents.
Our greatest achievement is the moral and political unity of our people, in which we perceive the paramount safeguard for successful implementation of all noble aspirations of Poles and also a dignified place of our country among other states of Europe and the world.
Mr. President, tomorrow you will be leaving Poland, departing for other countries. May I be permitted to express my conviction that the impressions you will be taking with you from the first leg of your trip and, first of all, the friendly feelings of the Polish people to the American people and our strivings to peace and cooperation will stay in your good memory for long.
I wish to propose a toast and ask all those present to join me to drink to you, Mr. President, and Mrs. Carter, to the successes .of the great American people, to the further expansion of friendly Polish-American relations.
THE PRESIDENT. First Secretary and Mrs. Gierek, distinguished leaders in politics, the military, music, drama, art, poetry, education, science, engineering:
We are very proud to be here in Poland and to have had a chance to meet with and to learn from First Secretary Gierek. We have already become close personal friends. He has taught me things that I can use in my own Nation. He has this afternoon discussed with me--and tonight--how he proposes to have a balance of trade in Poland. He sells hare or rabbits to adjacent countries for a lease in hunting preserves, and the rabbits are trained to return to Poland. [Laughter]
When I was running for President of the United States for 2 years, I met hundreds of thousands of Americans of Polish ancestry. I saw very quickly that they had a deep love for the United States and, simultaneously, for Poland. They recognize the historical ties which have bound our nations together since the very origins of our country. They have a natural hospitality inherited from their ancestors, and this made us look forward to this trip with great anticipation.
Our country has observed closely the distinguished Poles who have affected world history and our own Nation--ancient and modern scientists like Copernicus and Madam Curie, favorite authors like Joseph Conrad, musicians, Artur Rubinstein, who still loves Poland very deeply, and one of the greatest engineers of all time, Admiral Hyman Rickover, who developed the peaceful use of atomic power.
We have much to learn from Poland-how to use coal, and particularly brown coal, efficiently in this day of short energy supplies. We share cultural and scientific and engineering knowledge.
A hundred and twenty thousand Americans each year come back to visit their homeland here. And today I have seen at firsthand at your memorials a demonstration of affection for those who suffered so bravely in recent wars.
Georgia's capital city of Atlanta was completely destroyed in war, as was the city of Warsaw. But although we have suffered greatly, no other nation has borne such suffering as Poland. In the World War, six million Poles died--800,000 in Warsaw alone. Poles were the first people to fight the horrors of Nazism and earn the admiration and appreciation of the world. You were the ones who demonstrated a deep commitment to human rights, a belief in the value of human freedom and human life.
You have seen the horrible consequences of racial hatred when the Polish Jews were exterminated by Nazi terrorists. From these terrible experiences, valuable lessons have been learned. There is a tendency for those in the West to distrust those nations in the East. Sometimes, perhaps, you distrust our motives and our judgment. Sometimes we feel that you might be a danger to us as the NATO allies face the Warsaw Pact nations. But I know in more vivid terms than before that nations like your own and like the Soviet Union, which have suffered so deeply, will never commence a war unless there is the most profound provocation or misunderstanding brought about by lack of communication.
We also want peace and would never start a war except by mistake, when we didn't understand the motives and attitudes and desire for peace on the part of our potential adversaries.
I am pleased to know that there is increasing communication, consultation, and cooperation between the Socialist nations and the nations of the West. Although we belong to different military alliances, our hunger for peace is the same. We are working closely with the Soviet leaders to eliminate the constant and horrible threat of atomic destruction. This is an extremely complicated and technical discussion, but good motivations and common purposes can resolve those differences.
I have every expectation that this next year will bring success. We will do our utmost to realize this dream. We want to prevent the development of new and more powerful weapons and also to prevent any tests of atomic explosions. We want to prevent nations which do not presently have atomic explosions from desiring those capabilities. We want to reduce the sale of conventional weapons to nations around the world. And we want to seek in every possible way closer communications, better trade, closer friendship between our countries.
Poland and your leaders have an ability and experience to look knowledgeably both to the East and to the West, and you can contribute greatly to the mutual efforts of ourselves and the Soviet Union to reach those agreements which we both desire.
The ancient alliance between the United States and Poland in peace and war has given our people good lives. We have helped to establish and to maintain the independence of one another. This sharing of culture, blood kinship, and close cooperation in the past can give us a basis for even better future together.
I hope that at the earliest convenient time we might be permitted to repay the hospitality to your leaders, First Secretary Gierek and others, that you have extended to us on this visit. It is very valuable to have Polish and American friendship combined together to give us what all men and women want--peace throughout the world.
On behalf of the people of the United States, I would like to propose a toast to the indomitable spirit and to the freedom of the Polish people, to your enlightened leaders--particularly First Secretary Gierek and his wife--and to peace throughout the world.

state-dinners,Joseph R. Biden,"April 26, 2023","
President Biden. Good evening, everyone. Please, have a seat.
Welcome to the White House. Jill and I are honored to have you here tonight to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States. And to President Yoon and Mrs. Kim, thank you for making the journey. We're delighted to have you here.
I believe this visit tonight has brought two nations even closer together. Yesterday evening, President Yoon and Mrs. Kim joined Jill and me at the Korean veterans war memorial. And we walked past the solders standing in steel—there were steel carvings and standing sentinel, and read the names of the fallen etched in the granite.
And, as many of you know, at the end of the memorial, there's an engraving that reads: ""Our Nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met."" It's a solemn reminder that our alliance was born out of not shared borders, but need—shared beliefs—a belief in democracy, liberty, security, and above all, a mutual belief in freedom.
A little over 70 years ago, Korean and American troops stood together for those beliefs, serving and sacrificing so that children in both our countries might have a better future. And it's a future we're living today.
The way the Korean people have transformed your country, Mr. President, through courage and hard work is one of the most prosperous—it's one of the most prosperous and respected nations in the world—is testament to the boundless possibilities our people can achieve when we do it together. And we know that our work is not yet done.
Today, it's our duty to answer the call, that call to make the world better for those who will come after us. You know, this visit is about reaffirming all that unites our two nations. It's about a commitment to bear one another's concerns and listen to each other's dreams that allows us to overcome every difficulty and with great determination.
That allows us to further—to move further and faster in space, cyber, technology, and in all the areas that matter most to our future. And that allows us to build, build a world that is worthy of our highest hopes and a world that we want for our own children and grandchildren.
We stand at an inflection point—many of you have heard me say before—where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of our future for decades to come.
But I've never been more optimistic—and I mean that—I've never been more optimistic about our nations and what we can achieve together if we continue to work together as allies and as friends.
So please join me—and I'm looking for my—something to toast with here. [Laughter]
[At this point, President Biden was handed a wine glass by a White House aide.]
Thank you so much.
So please join me: To our partnership, to our people, to possibilities, and to the future the Republic of Korea and the United States that we'll create together. May we do it together for another 170 years.
[President Biden offered a toast.]
President Yoon. Mr. President, Dr. Biden, esteemed guests, and supporters of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, thank you for your warm welcome. Each of you at this magnificent and wonderful state dinner today is a reliable stakeholder and sponsor of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, which is one of the greatest in the history.
Mr. President, allow me to quote an Irish poet of yours. [Laughter] Seamus Heaney once wrote, ""Behavior that's admired is the path to power among people everywhere."" We admire sacrifices and actions of those who have propped up the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance for the past seven decades, have come together to forge a strong alliance in action, moving toward the future.
The seeds of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, sown in the ruins of the Korean war, have steadfastly grown over the past 70 years to form a rich and dense forest. The Republic of Korea's unprecedented economic growth and dynamic democracy have always been rooted in the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance.
Today President Biden and I, together, celebrated the 70th anniversary of the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance and had in-depth discussions on ways to further deepen our partnership in the future. We've reaffirmed that our trust in the alliance and our willingness to closely work together going forward will remain ironclad.
The alliance will last another seven decades and beyond. And it will open endless opportunities to the future generations of our two countries.
And going forward, the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance will take on more roles and responsibilities in order to tackle the complex crisis of our times. We will together embrace the future of the alliance, undergirded by our shared core values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.
The alliance will not only ensure the security and prosperity of both countries, but also contribute to the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and of the world. And those of you joining us here today are the main drivers for building such an alliance.
And there's an old saying—and, Mr. President, this one is also Irish—[laughter]—that goes: ""A good friend is like a four-leaf clover, hard to find and lucky to have."" Today will be remembered as a historic day where the R.O.K.-U.S. alliance, like a four-leaf clover, spreads its new roots wide beyond the glory of the past 70 years.
Now I ask you to join me in the toast. To our alliance, confidently marching toward the future. To our ironclad alliance.
[President Yoon offered a toast.]
President Biden. Very good.

state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"May 06, 1997","
Mr. President, Mrs. Zedillo, members of the Mexican Cabinet and other distinguished public servants, citizens of Mexico, on behalf of Hillary, of all the members of our delegation from the administration and the Congress, I first thank you for the graciousness and warmth with which you have welcomed us. We live side by side as neighbors, we work together day-in and dayout as partners, but the warmth of your reception has reminded us today that we are also close friends.
Just before the dinner began, President and Mrs. Zedillo took Hillary and me to see the magnificent murals of Diego Rivera that adorn this great palace. They are very moving works. Along with the paintings of Orozco and Siqueiros, they represent the peak of artistic achievement in this century and one of the many contributions of Mexico to the culture of the world. Anyone who has seen it knows that the power of Rivera's ""Epic of the Mexico People in Their Struggle for Freedom and Independence"" comes from more than mere technical skill. In this grand work we see the proud spirit of Mexico's revolution and Mexico's heart.
Instantly, I saw Rivera's extraordinary love of the Mexican people, the same passion which then and now inspires Mexico's journey toward a better and freer society. Rivera never actually finished his epic, and perhaps that is fitting because the journey of every nation to increase the freedom of its people, the labor at the very heart of democracy, never ends.
I am delighted to be in Mexico at another time when this struggle is making a dramatic stride forward. Mexico's leaders and political parties are opening the doors of democracy wider than ever. New citizen groups have sown the seeds of a vibrant civil society that promises to deliver to all Mexicans a better and freer future.
Mr. President, you reminded us that it was in this palace where Benito Juarez corresponded with Abraham Lincoln. Our President, Mr. Lincoln, who many of us consider to be our greatest President, called in the United States in his time for a new birth of freedom. The murals here remind us here that the birth of freedom is more than a matter of improving our political systems. We must also strive to see that our citizens are free from want and hunger, free from the dangers our new age brings, and free to make the most of their own lives.
The partnership we seek with Mexico is one that will advance that kind of freedom, here and throughout the Americas. We want to work together to lay the foundation of an enduring prosperity. We want to join together to improve the air and water we share. We want to work to turn our border into a region of growth, to defeat disease, to defeat the threat of drugs, organized crime, and corruption.
Mr. President, we can succeed because we have forged a relationship as broad and deep as that which exists between any two nations. And today we have made important progress. We are answering the demands of our time, advancing the common goals of our people, serving a friendship that is at the heart of what we all want for our future. In so doing, we honor the legacy of Benito Juarez and Abraham Lincoln and the constant quest for a new birth of freedom.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you now to join with me in toasting President and Mrs. Zedillo and their family, to partnership of our nations and the new day of freedom it will bring to the friends and neighbors of our shared continent.
"
state-dinners,William J. Clinton,"October 10, 1995","
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by the members of the Mexican delegation. To all again welcoming President and Mrs. Zedillo and of our distinguished guests, Hillary and I are pleased to welcome you back to the White House.
I have known President Zedillo less than a year now, but I feel as if I have known him for a very long time because of the remarkable similarities in our lives, some of which will surprise you, perhaps some of which will amuse you.
Both of us were lucky enough to come from families where everyone worked hard. His mother was a nurse, and so was mine. We both had the chance to do graduate work in England and both continued our studies at Yale on scholarships. We both married up. [Laughter] Like her husband, Mrs. Zedillo is a trained economist, and a quite good one. And I thought I would be a pretty good lawyer until I met Hillary. [Laughter] Most important of all, and most unbelievably to me, we both went to Acapulco on our honeymoons. [Laughter] And we both went on our honeymoons not only with our wives but with our in-laws. [Laughter] Now, what that says about our judgment, character, and vision, I leave for you to determine. [Laughter] But Mr. President, we clearly have a lot in common.
We are also privileged to lead two great nations whose histories and destinies are intertwined. Our strides are longer and our burdens are lighter because we advance together in partnership.
President Zedillo, you took office at a time of great challenge for your country. You held up a vision of Mexico for the future, a Mexico united in democracy and in prosperity. You also knew that Mexico would have to change to succeed, and you called on the Mexican people to join in your campaign for progress.
Only 3 short weeks later, financial crisis struck, and pessimists predicted collapse. But while those people were wringing their hands, Mr. President, you and I were ringing each other on the telephone. I knew that you were determined to lead Mexico forward, and we both knew that we were in the fight for the future together. The United States rallied the international community to Mexico's cause, and you, Mr. President, made the courageous and difficult choices that opened the door to recovery without closing the door to reform.
Because of your faith in the people of Mexico, because of your love for your homeland, because of your willingness to lead by example, putting long-term good ahead of short-term gain, Mexico's economy is back on track, and its democracy is stronger than ever. And Mr. President, the United States is proud to be your partner.
In your inaugural address, you offered the following challenge: Let it be said of us that we have dared have high aspirations and we knew how to make our dreams come true.
With respect to your achievements, let us raise a glass to your dreams and honor the President and the people of Mexico, the ties that bind us and the friendship between us, and our common vision and destiny in the future.
Viva Mexico.

state-dinners,Jimmy Carter,"May 02, 1979","
THE PRESIDENT. A poem written by the Emperor Meiji says, ""All the seas everywhere are brothers to one another. Why, then, do the winds and the waves of strife rage so violently to the world?""
I think that there are two countries on Earth which have seen the winds and the waves rage violently between them, and then to realize that all the oceans on Earth are brothers—it would be Our country and Japan.
We are honored tonight to have you here as guests. And we are also honored, of course, to have our friends from Japan, a delegation come to visit us, headed by Prime Minister Ohira, accompanied by his lovely wife.
Prime Minister Ohira has been a Finance Minister. He's been Foreign Minister, I think, twice. He's been the Minister of Trade and Development, and now he has been elected in the most popular type of election in the history of Japan, to hold the highest office, the highest elective office in his country.
Recently I have read his autobiography, and I have noticed with great attention that he comes from one of the southernmost islands of Japan. [Laughter] I'm not surprised. [Laughter] I have always had a conviction, never yet contravened, that statesmanship is not incompatible with residence in the South. [Laughter]
I met Prime Minister Ohira in 1975. And in a very concise, but interesting, even an exciting interview—I did not hold public office; I was a relatively un-' known candidate, in May of 1975, while Bob Strauss was supporting two other candidates— [laughter] —and I could not get an appointment with him- [laughter] —Mr. Ohira was kind enough to give me his ear and to give me his advice. And when I got through talking to him, he said, ""Well, what do you think your chances are?"" And I said, ""My friend, Mr. Ohira, the next time I see you we'll be in the White House."" [Laughter]
And I never thought he would be Prime Minister. [Laughter] So, I was really much more frank with him than he was with me. [Laughter]
But I can say for the benefit of this audience and for the benefit of the press, after my own experiences today, consulting with Bob Strauss, our trade representative, consulting with Secretary Vance, that this has been one of the most productive days in my own diplomatic life.
The economic problems are well on the way to being resolved. And I believe that I can state without concern to the American people that we have made tremendous progress and that the hopes for success are very good, thanks to the statesmanship of Prime Minister Ohira and thanks to the common purpose that binds our nations so tightly together, that I can't think of any predictable problem that could possibly separate us for more than a few months.
This is a powerful nation. Japan is emerging, as you well know, as one of those countries on Earth bound most closely to us because of their commitment to democratic principles; because of their deep commitment to peace; because of their concern, based on experience, about the proliferation of nuclear explosives; a nation of great economic achievement, based on the dedication, the hard work, the innovation, the scientific knowledge, the cohesiveness of their society, the individual workers; intense competitors who keep us all on our toes; but still a nation comprised of people who are gentle and who are polite and modest, who are cultural in their inclinations, dedicated to the finest, most sensitive exhibitions of artistic achievement.
I have never talked to a diplomat, a public official, or an average American tourist who came back from Japan disappointed. But there's always been a sense of compatibility and a realization of hospitality and of a mutual destiny. This is important to us, as you well know.
I will be going to Japan next month, at the end of the month, for an official state visit to return this one. My wife and Amy will go with us. And I look forward to that opportunity.
And Japan, for the first time in its history, will be the host for a multinational summit meeting, where the leaders of several of the great democratic nations will meet to discuss mutual problems and mutual opportunities.
My prediction is that this will be one of the most exciting visits that I myself have ever made to a foreign country. And I look forward to it with a great deal of anticipation and pleasure.
Japan is a nation, too, that's been able to accommodate extremely rapid change, which has aroused the legitimate admiration of the world. But at the same time, the Japanese people have been able to preserve the cohesiveness and the unity of their society, their nation, and the cohesiveness and unity of communities, and I think perhaps even more importantly, the cohesiveness and unity of the Japanese family.
We have a great future together, and I think all of you realize that with the explosion of technology and communications and population, the shortage of food, the intense competition in trade, the potential divisiveness between developed nations and nations still struggling for the basic elements of life, the vast advancement in the quality of weapons, the contentiousness of regional arguments spreading instantaneously throughout the world—it's become increasingly difficult for nations to live in harmony, but it's become increasingly imperative for nations to live in harmony.
And I believe that our own experience with Japan is a very good pattern or model for other nations to emulate in the future, not only distant nations but our Nation in its relationship with other countries. When we have differences which are profound and of great importance, we are absolutely dedicated to resolving those differences without delay. And the negotiators, the Presidents, the Prime Ministers have no doubt that that inclination to restore friendship and to restore understanding and to eliminate disagreements is an imperative forced on us by the deep feelings of the citizens whom we represent.
Well, in closing, I would like to say that I'm very proud of the productive partnership that we enjoy now with Japan and which will be a foundation for our Nation's foreign policy in Asia and one of the foundations for our worldwide foreign policy throughout the 1980's. And a great deal of the credit for this achievement can rest upon the superb leadership which has represented the people of Japan so well.
Trees in America are kind of a precious thing, and I know that the first assignment that Prime Minister Ohira had to a foreign nation was to Inner Mongolia. He accepted the assignment with a great deal of anticipation. When he arrived there—I won't go into detail—but one of the disappointments was that there was not a tree in the city where he had to live for 18 months.
But when the people of this Capital City think of Japan, or when the people of Georgia think of Japan, the first thought is the beauty of a cherry tree in April. And the Japanese, recognizing this characteristic of Americans, on our 200th birthday for a gift gave us a superb collection of bonsai trees, which we enjoy frequently in the White House and which visitors also enjoy.
I would like to say, in closing, that I have learned a lot from Prime Minister Ohira. I'm a little too impulsive, perhaps, as a politician, and maybe this is a characteristic of Americans—we don't have the patience to deal with intransigent problems in a careful, considered, often a productive way.
And in his book, in one of the latter chapters, when a young politician asked him for his best advice, he said something that's caused me to think a great deal today. He said, ""It's better to correct a wrong than it is to initiate many rights.""
We had quite a discussion here at the table between Bill Rogers, our finest athlete, who's won the Boston Marathon three times, and Joan Benoit, who is one of the most superb women athletes in the world, and Peter Falk, who's a great actor and who has one of his finest fans sitting across the table from him—two of his finest fans. But we discussed what the Prime Minister meant about that. And we decided that to correct wrongs was a great attribute of a political leader.
I would like to propose a toast: To the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Ohira, to his wife, to the wonderful people of Japan, to peace, to prosperity, to progress, and through the political system, to the correction of wrongs.
Mr. Prime Minister, we are proud to have you here, sir.
THE PRIME MINISTER. President and Mrs. Carter, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
I appreciate your kind words, Mr. President, for my countrymen and for me.
When we last met in 1975—you, as the former Governor of Georgia, and I, as Japan's Minister of Finance—I recall that you said, ""Next time, let us meet in the White House."" And here we are. [Laughter]
Mr. President, I also recall one piece of my personal history. Some 30 years ago, I was a guest of your Government's National Leaders program, under the auspices of the Department of Army, for a 3-month orientation visit to this country. It was a deeply rewarding experience.
On my return to Japan, I visited towns and villages of my constituency to make speeches on contemporary American affairs by making good use of my American experiences. It was my first campaign for a seat in the Diet. In a sense, therefore, the political career that has brought me to the White House this evening began three decades ago, in my first exposure to your great country.
Both of us, Mr. President, have been given by our fellow citizens the highest trust they can bestow—to lead them, as best we can, and with faith, through the difficult choices, domestic and foreign, which our two democracies now face in the world.
The responsibilities of the President of the United States are indeed awesome, because of America's unique power and mission in the maintenance of global peace, and because of your wide commitments in leadership of the free world.
Japan's responsibilities are also great and growing, and I am determined that we shall play an increasingly creative and effective role in world economic and political affairs, in closest partnership with our trusted friend and ally, the United States.
One of the great satisfactions of my present post as the Prime Minister of Japan is the opportunity to work with you, Mr. President, and your Government and people. I am eager to work to make the Japanese-American partnership a more powerful and productive force for the progress of the world community toward a more stable peace and a more widely shared prosperity.
I welcome this opportunity, because I know you share the deep conviction that there is spiritual meaning to man's being. I also believe that the eternal now is the only time we have to act on our convictions, and that you and I will, therefore, always be ready to make the difficult decisions which cross our desks each day.
I look forward to our collaboration.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you join me in toasting the health of the President of the United States, and the well-being and success of the American people.
Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much. That's beautiful English—beautiful.

Good evening. Welcome to the White House and to this wonderful dinner. As you can see, we had so many people who wanted to be here, who love Argentina and respect you, Mr. President, that we're in more than one room tonight. But we're all happy to be here, and Hillary and I welcome you all.
Mr. President, we hope that we have, in some small way, repaid the hospitality you showed us during our unforgettable visit to Argentina in October of 1997. At our dinner in Buenos Aires, I cited the memory of Domingo Sarmiento, who loved the United States but who complained that we ate our meals far too fast, often in 5 minutes or less. [Laughter] Tonight I hope our guests from Argentina will see that we value constructive criticism. This will be a long, leisurely meal. [Laughter]
The friendship between our two peoples reaches back to our earliest days as sister republics. In fact, our first envoy to Buenos Aires was sent well before there was a nation called Argentina. In 1810, as Joel Poinsett was leaving to take up his post in Argentina, he was instructed by the State Department to ""promote the most friendly relations"" between us, and remember that all nations lie under—and I quote—""a common obligation to maintain that system of peace, justice, and good will which is the only source of happiness for nations.""
Mr. President, those words are still a good description of our warm, rich, friendly relations. We share aspirations old and new, to deepen democracy, to strengthen justice, to educate our children, to preserve and enhance what we have inherited from our descendants, and to give other peoples a chance to live as peacefully and as prosperously as possible at the dawn of this new century.
Now, there are certain disputes we will never resolve, like which country has the better beef or whose cooks have better mastered the ancient art of barbecue. [Laughter] But as we approach the 200th anniversary of our official relationships, our friendship has never been stronger. We have a common enthusiasm for the future and a common parallel in our history: two nations generously blessed, blessed by nature, blessed by hard-working immigrants eager to build a better life.
Mr. President, I know how much this legacy means to you personally. It says a great deal about Argentina that a child of Syrian immigrants would grow up to be its President. It is remarkable to consider how far you have come and how far the nation has come under your leadership in the last 9 years.
Over the last decade, the world has undergone a remarkable transformation. Nowhere has it been more dramatic or complete than in the Americas, where Argentina has led by its example at home and its commitment abroad to freedom and democracy, to peace and prosperity. A great deal of the credit for South America's achievements and for its promise belongs with the man we honor this evening.
Borges once wrote a poem about our great 18th century theologian Jonathan Edwards. It included this line: ""Today is tomorrow and yesterday."" Tonight let us remember the best days of our past and plan even better days yet to come. But first, let us enjoy an unhurried dinner together. [Laughter]
I ask you to join me in a toast to the President and to the people of Argentina.

state-dinners,Ronald Reagan,"March 31, 1987","
The President. Mr. Prime Minister, Madame Chirac, Mr. Foreign Minister, and honored guests, and ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House. And if this had been 24 hours earlier, I was going to say, ""And, if I may, welcome to this splendid spring evening."" [Laughter] Well, we've spoken today of the challenges that confront our two great nations. This evening, Nancy and I'd like to invite you to relax. Mr. Prime Minister, Madame Chirac, you'll always be welcomed friends in this house. And by the way, I hope you all enjoyed this evening's dinner wine. You see, it was produced in California— [laughter] —as part of a joint French-American venture. [Laughter]
But no one can live in this house for long without feeling the vibrant spirit of our French and American forebears, of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, of Lafayette and Rochambeau. And I just have to believe they'd be proud to know that the common commitment to freedom that served as the foundation of our friendship so long ago remains alive in the White House tonight. But even as we look to the legendary figures of the past, we look as well to the major French and American figures of the present. And certainly, there are many here tonight, many who personify the bonds between us in diplomacy, in culture and commerce, in entertainment and science. Just recently we reached an important agreement regarding AIDS research, an agreement recognizing that French and American scientists stand together in the forefront of the battle against this tragic disease.
To everyone, all of our eminent guests, welcome. This evening, too, Nancy and I cannot help but recall our own travels to France during these last 6 years. I remember especially meeting with my summit colleagues in the halls and gardens of the Palace of Versailles, that place of immense beauty so alive with the history of France. And we remember standing on the beaches of Normandy, with the Channel waters behind and the cliffs above, thinking of the men who fought and died on that terrible day nearly 43 years ago when the fate of the free world hung in the balance, of the men who fought and died for freedom.
As is only befitting with close friends, Mr. Prime Minister, our discussions were frank and constructive. We covered East-West issues, arms control, the struggle against terrorism, regional conflicts—a broad agenda. We discussed our differences on trade issues, and how to narrow those differences in ways that would advance the economic well-being of our peoples. I know that you continued those discussions through the day with Secretary Shultz, Secretary Weinberger, and Secretary Baker, and that tomorrow you will meet with Vice President Bush.
As always, our discussions were able to take almost for granted certain shared values. Yet these values—liberty, democracy, the dignity of each individual—these values are sacred. And nowhere are they more important or more in evidence today than in the strength of the Atlantic alliance and in the unshakable commitment of the United States to share in the defense of Europe. So it is that, even as we seek to negotiate arms control and other agreements with the Soviet Union, we'll continue to consult closely with our European allies. Our message is clear to friend and foe alike: America stands with Europe.
And permit me now to invite you all to join me in raising a glass in friendship: To France and to our honored guests, Prime Minister Chirac and Madame Chirac.
The Prime Minister. Mr. President, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, my wife and I are extremely touched by the warmth of your welcome, as we are by this beautiful reception, which marks the end of a day we have just spent under the sign of friendship in this city of Washington. I wish to extend special thanks for this warm reception which brings together in this famous and beautiful house men and women of America and France from the worlds of the arts, of science, and of politics. And these thanks go to you, Mrs. Reagan, especially, because I know the personal part you have played in preparing this reception. And let me say how much we appreciate the elegance, the warmth, and the friendship of it all.
And let me tell you also, Mr. President, how happy we are to be with you here tonight, with a man who has managed to reconcile America with itself, to restore its self-confidence, and to give it the chance to hope anew—in other words, to restore the vigor of the American dream. And you know what high regard, friendship, and yes, indeed, affection Europeans and the people of France, in particular, have for you, sir.
When I arrived here this morning, what I said came from the heart. France is more than an ally; France is a faithful friend. America is sometimes convinced that she is insufficiently loved and does not always, however, set sufficient store by the intensity of France's feelings for America. These feelings are not only the result of the trials we have always borne side by side. They are not solely due to the fact that we share the same values: liberty. Today these ties are stronger than ever before because we naturally ask ourselves the same questions, because we have to meet the same challenges, and because we share a common will precisely to do so.
I'm rediscovering the same self-questioning spirit, the same will to go forward, to face the future with open eyes, to make hope triumph over doubt which I first experienced 30 years ago when I visited your country as a student. But I also want to emphasize how much France, in the alliance of Western democracies, is indeed a strong European partner that the United States can rely upon. And this strength is due to the deep commitment of the whole of the people of my country to the principles that govern our foreign policy and our national security. These principles are those which General de Gaulle defined 30 years ago, and all of the Governments of France since then, without fail, have abided by them.
In no other European country is there such a large consensus on the main lines of foreign policy: respect for existing alliances, national independence, and being present in world affairs. In Europe, France is working both for the development of unity and respect, at the same time for diversity. In Africa, she's fighting attempts of destabilization. In Latin America, defending democracy against dictatorship. In the Middle East, she wishes to engage in dialog with all parties concerned, so as better to explore the paths of peace. In the Pacific, she wishes to enhance the region's harmony and stability. And finally, France fervently hopes that the rich countries of the world through greater generosity will be able to prevent a larger number of countries from sinking even deeper into debt and experiencing even worse poverty. And France intends to work steadfastly towards the attainment of this goal.
In no other European country is there such a consensus in favor of development and modernization of defense capabilities, and more particularly, in favor of a nuclear deterrent that guarantees respect for national independence and liberty in all circumstances. And finally, one cannot forget the French people's unanimous agreement not to give in to terrorist blackmail and remain in adversity, one and determined.
But, Mr. President, the message which I bear today is also that of a new France which has learned the lessons of economic crisis and has decided to turn its back on outdated remedies and patterns and to undertake deep change, modifying century old habits in order better to meet the requirements of tomorrow. Over the last thousand years, monarchy has shaped France's identity, and the price of this was a necessary process of centralization, which under the revolution and the Napoleonic empire were indeed consolidated. And as you were mentioning yourself, Mr. President, to me, Alexis de Tocqueville quite aptly remarked: In a country where for centuries at end everything was handed down by the top of the power structure, things had to change.
And indeed, an actual revolution is today underway in which hitherto nationalized companies are being handed back to the private sector, in which the audiovisual media still under state control are being given over to private initiative, in which regulations that long stifled the economy's efficiency are being eliminated, in which an increasing number of responsibilities are being transferred to local authorities.
Now, a year ago Francois Mitterrand, President of the French Republic, appointed me Prime Minister. The people of France have entrusted to my government the mission to release the energies of our country and to give free rein to its creativity and can-do spirit, which have traditionally found an outlet in the arts, in which most today show their mettle in economy, business, and industry. Loyal, strong, open to the world around it, Mr. President, such is the France that is visiting you today.
I wish to raise my glass in honor of Mr. Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America; Mrs. Nancy Reagan, to whom I present my most respectful regards; to the future of friendship and cooperation between France and the United States. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mrs. Reagan.

state-dinners,John F. Kennedy,"July 11, 1961","
Ladies and gentlemen:
I want to express, first, the appreciation of us all to our hosts, and I would not want the President of Pakistan and his party to think that he was being entertained by the United States Government, or the President. We are all guests here tonight--the Americans and our visitors from abroad--of a somewhat obscure group, but nevertheless extremely powerful and significant, the Ladies of Mount Vernon.
It is a source of great satisfaction to my wife, far surpassing anything else that has happened to her, that she is related by marriage to Connecticut, which is the title given to the Lady of Mount Vernon who comes from that State.
We are also, though Members of Congress never probably realized it, we also have in Congress, Ohio-which is Mrs. Bolton, who is the Lady who is very active in politics but hides many of the things that she does under a bushel, and has labored long for Mount Vernon and for many other causes, and as usual none of us knows about it. So we want to express our great satisfaction in having a member of our lowly profession so honored by the Ladies.
I want to express our thanks to the Regent, Mrs. Beirne, who has been so generous, and to Mr. Wall, who is the Director of Mount Vernon. I want to say, and I am sure I speak on behalf of my fellow countrymen and women, the great pride and satisfaction that we have in Mount Vernon. This is the first time, I am sure, that any of us have dined here. This is a great object of regard and respect by our fellow citizens. It is intensely felt by the Members of the Congress and members of the Government, and therefore for all of us, not only from abroad but from home who come to Mount Vernon, we feel the greatest pride in it.
Mr. President, we feel a special satisfaction because you are our guest tonight and because we feel that what Mount Vernon stands for is understood by you. Mount Vernon means to us not merely a beautiful home, but it also is, we hope, the symbol of the United States--in the past, the present, and we hope the future.
This country was developed by an extraordinary group of men who had wide talent, who came from among the most prosperous group in our country, and yet were revolutionaries, and who made this country's independence possible. And we hope that the same principles with which our hosts tonight honor President Washington, we hope this country stands for today.
We recognize in you a leader who stands for those things in his own country, who recognizes that the independence of his own country is not enough, that there is a link which binds your country and ours all the way across the globe. And it is a particular source of satisfaction to my wife and to myself that this dinner here honors you who, as I said at the airport this morning, has been a friend of our country long before I became the President; but even in the short time that I have been President, I have seen a most particular manifestation of your country's willingness to commit itself for the cause of freedom.
George Washington once said, ""I would rather be at Mount Vernon with a friend or two about me than be attended at the seat of government by the officers of state and the representatives of every power in Europe.""
We have got a friend or two about us tonight. We nevertheless feel that Washington would be glad we are here, and would be glad that we are his guests and particularly, I believe, that you brought your daughter and her husband here, and the members of your party. And I hope you realize that among both Republicans and Democrats, and among all the Americans here tonight, that no one could be a more welcome guest.
I hope that you will all join with me in drinking a toast to the President of Pakistan and the people of his country.
