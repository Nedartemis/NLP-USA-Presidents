CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE
11TH TACTICAL RECONNAISSANCE SQUADRON
The 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force in Southeast Asia, from 26 July 1966 to 31 March 1967. During this period, the 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was responsible for providing the major portion of all daylight tactical reconnaissance and all night tactical reconnaissance over North Vietnam. Although operating under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions of an enemy air defense system that was expanding daily and becoming more complex and deadly, aircrews of the 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron accomplished their arduous missions in an outstanding manner. Their exemplary performance contributed significantly to the success of the United States Air Force's tactical reconnaissance program in North Vietnam. The extraordinary heroism and outstanding combat professionalism consistently displayed by the Unit's aircrews were matched by similarly superb efforts from the Squadron's maintenance and support personnel. By their gallantry, professionalism and untiring devotion to duty, personnel of the 11th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron upheld the highest standards of performance and traditions of the military service and reflected great credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION (ARMY) FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
TO 1ST PLATOON, COMPANY B, 1ST BATTALION,
69TH ARMOR UNITED STATES ARMY
The 1st Platoon distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism and outstanding professionalism while serving under the operational control of the 9th Company, 1st Cavalry Regiment, Republic of Korea Army during the defense of Landing Zone Twenty Seven Victor, Pleiku Province, Republic of Vietnam during the night of 9-10 August 1966. About one hour before midnight the sounds of digging outside the defensive perimeter were reported to one of the tank commanders by a Korean officer. The tank commander illuminated the suspicious area with the tank searchlight and reconnoitered it with machine gun fire. This action triggered the first of a series of violent attacks made against the position by a North Vietnamese Army battalion and reinforced by heavy fire from recoilless rifles, mortars, and rockets. During the next six hours, the foe made repeated assaults froth different directions, only to be beaten back by the coordinated fire of the stalwart defenders. Battlefield illumination was augmented by the two available tank searchlights until the latter were destroyed by enemy fire. Despite one fourth of its members being wounded, the 1st Platoon greatly assisted the 9th Company in holding the position under the intense ground attacks. The tenacious defense and subsequent mop-up of the battlefield virtually eliminated the enemy battalion as an effective fighting unit. The heavy losses inflicted upon the numerically superior enemy force attest to the physical courage, determination, and skill of the defenders. The close coordination and mutual cooperation between the Republic of Korea and the United States forces resulted in a fighting team undaunted by the enemy onslaught. This action of the 1st Platoon, Company B, 1st Battalion, 69th Armor is in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army.

GENERAL OF THE ARMY Henry H. Arnold, United States Army. For exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service in the performance of duties of great responsibility as Chief of the Air Corps from September 29, 1938 to May 31, 1941, as Deputy Chief of Staff for Air from November 29, 1940 to March 8, 1942, and as Chief of the Army Air Forces from June 20, 1941 to March 8, 1942. He performed the duties required by the office in a superior manner during the most strenuous and trying period in the history of the air arm. During this period, an Air Corps Program of Expansion and Procurement was inaugurated whereby the personnel of the Air Forces was increased in excess of a thousand per cent and the number of aircraft increased proportionately. A program of expansion and procurement of this magnitude demanded comprehensive planning, its execution required outstanding ability, foresight, and leadership, all of which were exhibited by General Arnold in a high degree. He impressed this high quality of leadership, so vitally needed during this period of readjustment and difficulties, on the Air Forces as a whole, thereby maintaining at the highest standard the morale and efficiency of the personnel of the Army Air Forces for the accomplishment of the tasks before them.

CITATION FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL
(Oak Leaf Cluster)
AS COMMANDER of the Army Air Forces during World War II, General Henry H. Arnold gave his nation outstanding service. To him fell the mission of building American air power for a global war in which victory or defeat depended on control of the skies. He fulfilled his mission in a manner that overwhelmed this nation's enemies and awed its allies. He welded the civilian productive genius of the aircraft industry, an expert military nucleus and more than 2,000,000 American soldiers to form an indomitable, unprecedented destructive weapon which coordinated with our land and sea forces to obliterate the Axis powers. As a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States and British Combined Chiefs of Staff, General Arnold helped shape the strategy and direct the resources of the victorious Allied forces. His wide knowledge of the employment of air power was of great value to the deliberations of the Chiefs of Staff. From concept to execution, General Arnold's leadership guided the mightiest air force in history. No single factor of the great allied victories was more vital than the destruction of the capacity of Germany and Japan to wage modern technological warfare. The long range precision attacks of massed air power which accomplished this objective were the products of his genius. At the same time General Arnold directed the training and equipment of the United States Tactical Air Force so that when the great decisive three-dimensional battles of World War II were joined, his fighters and attack bombers were ready to sweep the skies of the enemy and deny him mobility on the surface. During the growth of the Air Arm, General Arnold constantly increased the effectiveness of its activities by imaginative conceptions concerning the application of air power to strategy and tactics and by the development of potent new weapons. By his personal leadership, his driving spirit, and his professional genius, General Arnold made a great contribution to our war effort.

for exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility:
General Gruenther performed exceptionally meritorious and distinguished service to the Government of the United States while serving in positions of great responsibility during the period 10 December 1950 to 31 December 1956. As Chief of Staff of the SHAPE Advance Planning Group from 10 December 1950 to 1 April 1951, he displayed a superb grasp of the many complicated problems inherent in the unprecedented establishment of an international military headquarters. His foresight and brilliant planning contributed in a large measure to the effective and orderly activation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. As Chief of Staff of SHAPE from 2 April 1951 to 10 July 1953, his handling of the complicated matters involved in developing an integrated staff, coupled with his manner of leadership and consequent ability to gain the confidence of all nationalities and services, resulted in the creation of a cohesive and enthusiastic staff. His executive skill and his profound understanding of multi-service problems did much to make possible the development of sound plans and objectives for the most effective utilization of Allied Forces in the common defense of the free world. As Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and Commander in Chief, United States European Command, from 11 July 1953 to 20 November 1956, his inspiring leadership, his keen appreciation of the individual difficulties confronting each of the member nations, his administrative soundness, and his personal capacity for presenting solutions to existing problems to the various national authorities were major contributing factors in increasing the strength of the alliance. His candor, integrity, brilliance, and unswerving belief in the principles of collective security have won him the respect and confidence of leaders at the highest level in all NATO nations. In so doing, General Gruenther has made an exceptional contribution to the defense of the free world and has carried on the highest traditions of the military service and reflected great credit on himself and the United States.

for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Machine Gunner of Company I, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on the night of 4-5 September 1952. Volunteering for his second continuous tour of duty on a strategic combat outpost far in advance of the main line of resistance, Private First Class McLaughlin, although operating under a barrage of enemy artillery and mortar fire, set up plans for the defense of his position which proved decisive in the successful defense of the outpost. When hostile forces attacked in battalion strength during the night, he maintained a constant flow of devastating fire upon the enemy, alternately employing two machine guns, a carbine and hand grenades. Although painfully wounded, he bravely fired the machine guns from the hip until his hands became blistered by the extreme heat from the weapons and, placing the guns on the ground to allow them to cool, continued to defend the position with his carbine and grenades. Standing up in full view, he shouted words of encouragement to his comrades above the din of battle and, throughout a series of fanatical enemy attacks, sprayed the surrounding area with deadly fire, accounting for an estimated one hundred and fifty enemy dead and fifty wounded. By his indomitable courage, superb leadership and valiant fighting spirit in the face of overwhelming odds, Private First Class McLaughlin served to inspire his fellow Marines in their gallant stand against the enemy and was directly instrumental in preventing the vital outpost from falling into the hands of a determined and numerically superior hostile force. His outstanding heroism and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

The 366th Tactical Fighter Wing, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary gallantry while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia from 23 April 1967 to 1 August 1967. During this period, the members of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing achieved outstanding success while challenging the North Vietnamese Air Force for aerial supremacy over North Vietnam. Aircrews of the Wing destroyed twelve MIGs and probably destroyed two others during fierce aerial battles. The success of these air battles was due in a great measure to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Wing personnel who pioneered the use of the externally carried 20 mm Galling gun. Four of their aerial victories were achieved with this unique weapon. In addition to assuring control of the skies over North Vietnam, personnel of the 366th attacked many key targets with great precision destroying vast quantities of supplies needed by the enemy and disrupting his transportation system. The extraordinary heroism displayed by this unit in the pursuit of its mission is in keeping with the highest standards of .performance and traditions of the United States military service.

The foregoing companies of and units attached to the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry, 173d Airborne Brigade (Separate) distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in action against hostile forces in the vicinity of Bien Hoa, Republic of Vietnam, on 8 November 1965. The morning after the Battalion had conducted a search operation and learned from patrols that a strong hostile element was in the general area, Company C, the lead Company, encountered a well-entrenched and camouflaged Viet Cong force. When the insurgents opened fire with a volume of automatic weapons fire, the United States forces retaliated.
As the battle grew in intensity and it became evident that Company C had engaged a battalion-size Viet Cong element which attempted to surround the flanks of this American unit, Company B was committed to secure the right flank of Company C. Simultaneously, elements of Company A attacked the left flank of the insurgent force. Although Company B met strong resistance and fought at close range in a dense jungle area, it succeeded in penetrating the hostile circle around Company C. Then, as Company B's open flank was being enveloped, the brave men of this Company broke a hostile encirclement for the second time.
Despite the constant Viet Cong assaults, their continual attacks in human waves, and the many casualties sustained by the American units, the gallant and determined troops of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry repulsed the Viet Cong and inflicted severe losses upon them. After a battle which raged throughout the afternoon, elements of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry defeated a numerically superior hostile force and, on the following morning, counted four hundred and three Viet Cong dead in the immediate area.
The devotion to duty, perseverance, and extraordinary heroism displayed by these members of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry and the attached units are in the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit upon themselves and the armed forces of their country.

SAMUEL I. ROSENMAN, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the President of the United States and his country. As an unofficial adviser to the late President Roosevelt, he gave freely of his time and many talents, coming to Washington whenever called by the President. During the critical war years, he came to Washington, at a great personal sacrifice, to become Special Counsel to the President, the first to occupy that important position. In order so to serve, he resigned as Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. Through his great talents, his vast experience as a lawyer, legislator, and judge, and his ability to organize and dispatch work, he was of inestimable service to the President and the country in carrying to a successful and speedy conclusion World War II. He rendered sound advice on many matters of national and international policy, legislation and government administration and lifted from the shoulders of the President many vexatious problems, thus lessening materially the burdens of the Chief Executive and Commander in Chief, and permitting him to give his attention to more important problems. Through his assistance in the reorganization of many of the Executive Departments, and agencies of the Government as required by war needs, the business of government was carried on with greater effectiveness. He served with distinction not only in this country, but also abroad, where he represented the President in matters of great international importance. After the untimely death of President Roosevelt, he continued as Special Counsel to President Truman and has rendered great assistance to him in the initial stages of the reconversion period. Justice Rosenman brought to his office not only high professional attainments, but a marked devotion to duty, great perseverance, outstanding administrative ability, and a deep sense of public service.

For exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 16 July 1966 to 31 August 1967, in the conduct of naval unconventional warfare operations against the Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam. Although often required to carry out their operations in treacherous and almost impenetrable mangrove swamps against overwhelming odds, SEAL TEAM ONE personnel maintained an aggressive operating schedule and were highly successful in gathering intelligence data and in interdicting Viet Cong operations. On one occasion, a six-man fire team ambushed one junk and two sampans, accounting for seven Viet Cong dead and the capture of valuable intelligence data. During this daring ambush, all members of the fire team remained in exposed, waist-deep mud and water in order to obtain clear fields of fire. As a result of their constant alertness and skillful reading of Viet Cong trail markers, patrols of SEAL TEAM ONE succeeded in discovering numerous well-concealed Viet Cong base camps and supply caches, and captured or destroyed over 228 tons of Viet Cong rice, as well as numerous river craft, weapons, buildings, and documents. The outstanding esprit de corps of the men of this unit was evidenced on 7 October 1966 when a direct hit by an enemy mortar round wounded sixteen of the nineteen men aboard the detachment's armed LCM, and again on 7 April 1967 when three members of the SEAL TEAM ONE LCM were killed and eleven were wounded in a fire fight with Viet Cong positioned along the banks of a narrow stream. On both occasions, SEAL TEAM ONE men who were able, even though seriously wounded, returned to their positions and continued to fire their weapons until the boat was out of danger, thereby helping to save the lives of their comrades. The heroic achievements of SEAL TEAM ONE reflect the outstanding professionalism, valor, teamwork, and selfless dedication of the unit's officers and men. Their performance was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

The 52d Ranger Battalion and the above attached units, Army of the Republic of Vietnam, distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in action against hostile forces in the vicinity of Phu Hai, Phuoc Tuy Province, Republic of Vietnam on 11 November 1965.
After providing relief for an outpost that had been under attack, the Rangers were returning to their home station and engaged in a road clearing operation when information was received that a large force of Vietcong planned an ambush along the return route. Without hesitation, the Rangers deployed to advantageous positions and used sound counter-ambush techniques. When contact was made with the numerically superior force, the friendly troops launched an assault on the Vietcong which drove them toward the northeast. Having regrouped, the Rangers again assaulted the Vietcong positions just as hostile reinforcements began moving toward them from the north.
In close, fierce fighting, the Rangers forced the insurgents from their positions in the northeast into the path of their reinforcements approaching from the north, causing both the advancing and retreating hostile elements to be caught in the open and become the target of accurate air strikes. Then as an insurgent unit, moving to the west, attacked a small force of Rangers left to guard vehicles near Kim Hai, a Ranger Company quickly moved back to the ambush site, drove off the Vietcong, and retrieved all but three of their vehicles.
The determination, devotion to duty, indomitable courage, and extraordinary heroism demonstrated by the members of the 52d Ranger Battalion and its attached units in defending their homeland are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon themselves and the Republic of Vietnam.

His entire administration was marked by a deep devotion to our democratic ideals of justice and freedom.
Conditions in Germany were such that he could not be spared from his task until May fifteenth of this year.

MERIT DEGREE OF COMMANDER
GEORGES BIDAULT, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, was called to the colors in the autumn of 1939 and devotedly served his country as a sergeant of infantry until the spring of 1940 when he was taken prisoner by the Germans. In July 1941, after more than a year of captivity, he regained his freedom, whereupon without regard for his own safety or well-being he immediately became extremely active in French underground affairs. Displaying at all times zealous determination to drive the invader from France, he played a major part in organizing the French Resistance Movement for effective cooperation with the Allied armies, and became President of the National Council of Resistance, which post he occupied on the Day of Liberation. Continuing as Minister of Foreign Affairs to cooperate with the United Nations in the pursuit of their ideals, M. Bidault fostered a spirit of friendship and harmony between his republic and that of the United States.

CITATION FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE MEDAL
AS SECRETARY OF WAR from the beginning of the actual mobilization of the Army to the final victory over Japan, Henry Lewis Stimson gave the United States of America a measure of distinguished service exceptional in the history of the nation.
Following 40 years of conspicuous public service in which he fought as a combat officer in one war and twice served in the cabinets of Presidents, Mr. Stimson unhesitatingly accepted the vast responsibility for the development of the American armies to play a determining part in the desperate human conflict now victoriously terminated.
His fearlessness, his integrity, his rich experience, his wisdom and his statesmanship were largely contributory to the successful mobilization, deployment and operations of an Army in which his countrymen may take everlasting pride. His steadfast purpose and unselfish devotion were an inspiration to men-at-arms in American forces throughout the world in their bitter fight to maintain moral right, freedom, justice
and civilization itself.

GENERAL HUMPHREYS, a career officer in the Air Force Medical Corps, has just returned from 2 years in Vietnam. He was there, as part of our AID program, to help develop a national medical program for the Vietnamese people.
In the midst of war, he was deeply committed to advancing the works of peace. And he succeeded outstandingly.
When he arrived, there were 80 Americans working on health programs for the benefit of that sorely beset people. Today there are some 900--eleven times as many. And they have been joined by some 500 medical personnel from other free nations.
They are now at work in 40 provincial hospitals, district, village, and hamlet health stations throughout South Vietnam.
Their work has revolutionized the care of the sick. They have brought hope where once there was only despair. They have helped us, and the Government of Vietnam, demonstrate anew that we are determined to bring them the better life for which they long, and which is their right.

THE EIGHTH AIRBORNE BATTALION, AIRBORNE DIVISION, ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC
OF VIETNAM
The Eighth Airborne Battalion, Airborne Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against a hostile force from 25 to 28 February 1966. During this period, the Eighth Airborne Battalion conducted several successful assaults against strongly fortified insurgent positions after other friendly units had failed in their attempts to defeat the hostile forces. In the first engagement, the hostile forces had repulsed a coordinated attack by two ARVN battalions. After the friendly battalions withdrew, the Eighth Airborne Battalion advanced in the face of heavy small arms, machine gun, and mortar fire across 800 meters of open rice paddy in an assault against the fortified hostile positions. In heavy fighting at extremely close quarters, the Battalion routed the insurgents and forced them to retreat in disorder from their fortified positions, leaving many dead and wounded personnel and a significant amount of equipment on the battlefield. Two days later, in a second engagement at another location, the enemy, in dug-in and heavily fortified positions, again repulsed an attack by ARVN battalions. The Eighth Airborne Battalion was again ordered to attack across 2,000 meters of open rice paddy through heavy flanking fire to seize the enemy position. In spite of heavy casualties, the gallant and determined paratroopers swept into the enemy positions and, in close combat, again defeated the enemy and forced him into a disorderly retreat. The next day an enemy force was located in well-entrenched positions along a tree line adjacent to a small village. When the friendly main attack was repulsed, the Eighth Airborne Battalion, initially in reserve, was committed to the attack. The Battalion advanced across 500 meters of open rice paddy against intense enemy machine gun and mortar fire to assault the positions. After reaching the tree line, the Battalion closed with the enemy and, employing small arms, hand grenades, and bayonets, forced the enemy to withdraw from his prepared positions, leaving behind many casualties and weapons. In each engagement, the Eighth Airborne Battalion was supported by minimal artillery and air support and had to rely almost entirely upon its light organic weapons and the valor, skill, and determination of the individual soldier and small unit leaders to accomplish its mission. The exemplary actions of the Eighth Airborne Battalion under these extremely difficult and hazardous conditions are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military profession and reflect great credit upon itself and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

The 12th Air Commando Squadron, Pacific Air Forces, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an opposing armed force while conducting defoliation missions throughout the Republic of Vietnam, from 21 August 1966 to 30 June 1967. During this period, members of the 12th Air Commando Squadron repeatedly encountered extremely heavily defended target complexes while flying at a very low altitude and airspeed required for successful accomplishment of proper defoliation. Despite the constant personal danger inherent in the performance of their vital mission, these men defoliated over 1,200,000 acres of jungle canopy which concealed hostile forces. The subsequent and continuing ground and air operations in the defoliated areas have been aided immeasurably by the accomplishments of these men. Their esprit de corps, great heroism, and devotion to duty in the performance of this hazardous mission typify the noblest traditions of the military profession. By their extraordinary courage, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of hostile forces, the members of the 12th Air Commando Squadron have reflected the highest credit upon themselves and the United States Air Force.

Throughout this period, the gallantry, professionalism, determination, and esprit de corps consistently demonstrated by the personnel of the 6234th Tactical Fighter Wing were instrumental factors in the successful completion of their assigned mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions. During this period, personnel of the Wing flew 10,797 sorties, totaling 26,165 hours, in the face of fire from modern, sophisticated enemy air defense weaponry, to include surface-to-air missiles. The pilots of the 6234th Tactical Fighter Wing were responsible for the destruction or damage of important military targets in North Vietnam, including airfields, petroleum storage areas, railroads, and missile sites. As a result of the Wing's operation against the infiltration routes used by the North Vietnamese, the support of the hostile forces in South Vietnam was made more difficult and costly. During this period of sustained combat operations, the Wing developed and implemented a new training program and perfected techniques for use in the F4C (Phantom) night operations, which proved exceptionally effective in assuring target destruction and providing security for aircrews . The extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance demonstrated by this unit in the pursuit of its mission are in keeping with the highest standards of performance and traditions of the United States military service and reflect great credit upon the unit and the United States Air Force.

At a time of bitter industrial strife, with the vision of a statesman he worked effectively to stabilize labor-management relations and in that sphere of complex and conflicting interests set a pattern out of which grew a more equitable relationship between employer and employee. Through all the active years of a busy life, in peace and in war, this remarkable man with a deep sense of public service has been a patron of the arts and sciences and' a liberal benefactor in the fields of education and philanthropy. Happily he is now in the zenith of his powers--a hale veteran in high service. As a diplomatist Mr. Taylor has been the Personal Representative of two Presidents of the United States to His Holiness the Pope with the rank of Ambassador. On many missions to His Holiness and to other leaders in church and state throughout Europe he has labored diligently with men of good will in parallel efforts to promote peace and concord among nations torn asunder by jealousy, hatred and ill will and to ameliorate the misery which inevitably follows in the wake of war. He has carried out his manifold and arduous duties with selfless disregard of incessant demands upon his own health and strength.

Although initially outnumbered more than ten to one and completely surrounded, Troop A tenaciously contained the fierce Viet Cong attack. As the enemy pressed its coordinated attack with mortars, automatic weapons, recoilless rifles and anti-tank rockets, the courageous defenders of the artillery fire support base at Ap Bau Bang sustained many direct hits on their combat vehicles, destroying two of the vehicles and wounding over half the troopers. With dauntless courage, ignoring their wounds, they struck back at the fanatical enemy, breaking up the enemy's repeated assaults. In violently executed moves, the besieged Troop A perimeter was reinforced by elements of Troop B, C and Headquarters, to relieve pressure on the defenders and destroy the Viet Cong forces. As the armored reinforcing columns raced to the battle area, they broke through the Viet Cong ambushes prepared for them, continued on to the embattled perimeter under intense fire, charged through the heavy enemy concentrations, and accomplished the first successful night reinforcement by armored units of a perimeter under heavy Viet Cong attack in the Vietnamese conflict. Massed fires of the cavalrymen and supporting artillery, armed helicopters, and tactical air fires poured into the enemy masses, as the troopers conducted successive counterattacks to complete the rout of the 273d Viet Cong Regiment. As dawn broke, after the six hour battle, enemy dead covered the battlefield. The indomitable fighting spirit and gallantry of the cavalry troopers achieved a signal victory at Ap Bau Bang which contributed significantly to the success of Operation Junction City in the Vietnamese campaign.

CITATION
For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government of the United States as Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Areas, from June 1944, to August 1945. Initiating the final phase in the battle for victory in the Pacific, Fleet Admiral Nimitz attacked the Marianas, invading Saipan, inflicting a decisive defeat in the Japanese Fleet in the First Battle of the Philippines and capturing Guam and Tinian. In vital continuing operations, his Fleet Forces isolated the enemy-held bastions of the Central and Eastern Carolinas and secured in quick succession Peleliu, Angaur and Ulithi. With reconnaissance of the main beaches on Leyte effected, approach channels cleared and opposition neutralized in joint operations to reoccupy the Philippines, the challenge by powerful task forces of the Japanese Fleet resulted in a historic victory in the three-phased Battle for Leyte Gulf, October 24 to 26, 1944. Accelerating the intensity of aerial offensive by pressure exerted at every hostile strong point, Fleet Admiral Nimitz culminated long-range strategy by successful amphibious assault on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. A wise, steadfast and indomitable leader, Fleet Admiral Nimitz, by his daring strategy and his faith in the courage and skill of the officers and men under his command, finally placed representative forces of the United States Navy in the harbor of Tokyo for the formal capitulation of the Japanese Empire. Through his mastery of naval warfare, his strategical skill, his sound judgment and his inspiring leadership, he demonstrated the highest qualities of a naval officer and rendered services of the greatest distinction to his country.

Sergeant Bleak, Army Medical Service, United States Army, a member of the Medical Company, 223d Infantry Regiment, 40th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and indomitable courage above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy in the vicinity of Minari-gol, Korea, on 14 June 1952. As a medical aidman, he volunteered to accompany a reconnaissance patrol committed to engage the enemy and capture a prisoner for interrogation. Forging up the rugged slope of the key terrain, the group was subjected to intense automatic weapons and small arms fire and suffered several casualties. After administering to the wounded, he continued to advance with the patrol. Nearing the military crest of the hill, while attempting to cross the fireswept area to attend the wounded, he came under hostile fire from a small group of the enemy concealed in a trench. Entering the trench, he closed with the enemy, killed two with bare hands and a third with his trench knife. Moving from the emplacement, he saw a concussion grenade fall in front of a companion and, quickly shifting his position, shielded the man from the impact of the blast. Later, while ministering to the wounded, he was struck by a hostile bullet but, despite the wound, he undertook to evacuate a wounded comrade. As he moved down the hill with his heavy burden, he was attacked by two enemy soldiers with fixed bayonets. Closing with the aggressors, he grabbed them and smashed their heads together, then carried his helpless comrade down the hill to safety.

SERGEANT FIRST CLASS (THEN SERGEANT)
OLA L. MIZE, USA
for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy:
Sergeant Mize, Infantry, United States Army, a member of Company K, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and outstanding courage above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy near Surang-ni, Korea, on 10-11 June 1953. Company K was defending ""Outpost Harry,"" a strategically valuable position, when the enemy launched a heavy attack. Learning that a wounded comrade lay helpless at a friendly listening post, Sergeant Mize with a medical aid man moved through intense enemy fire and rescued him. On returning to his position Sergeant Mize organized an effective defense and inflicted heavy casualties against the continuously and fiercely attacking enemy. During this period he was knocked down three times by the concussion of artillery and grenade blasts but each time he dauntlessly arose and resumed the violent combat. When enemy onslaughts ceased temporarily with the enemy in possession of friendly emplacements in the outpost area, he led his few remaining men from bunker to bunker, firing into the apertures, throwing grenades at the entrenched foe, and effectively neutralizing their positions. When an enemy soldier suddenly stepped from cover prepared to fire at one of Sergeant Mize's men, Sergeant Mize killed him saving the life of his fellow-soldier. After rejoining the platoon, he observed that a friendly machine gun had been overrun. Unhesitatingly, he fought his way to the position, single-handedly killing ten of the enemy and dispersing the remainder. Fighting his way back to his command post he took a position to protect several wounded soldiers. Later, securing a radio, he directed friendly artillery fire upon the attacking enemy's routes of approach and at dawn he helped regroup for a counterattack which drove the enemy from the outpost. Sergeant Mize's valorous conduct and unflinching courage reflect lasting glory upon himself and uphold the noble traditions of the military service.

THE 2D BATTALION (AIRBORNE) 503D INFANTRY, 173D AIRBORNE BRIGADE ( SEPARATE )
AND ATTACHED UNITS
The 2d Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry, 173d Airborne Brigade (Separate), with attachments, is cited for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against a hostile force near Phouc Vinh, Republic of Vietnam, on March 10, 1966 The Battalion was participating as part of a larger force on a search and destroy mission sweeping a portion of war zone ""D"" during operation ""Silver City"", and had been in contact with small groups of Viet Cong during four days of operations in the dense jungle area. On the morning of 16 March the Battalion was deployed in a defensive perimeter in preparation for resuming operations.
At approximately 0700 hours a patrol from Company ""B"" had begun to move from its positions to initiate action against the enemy. At the same time, a resupply helicopter was descending onto the landing zone located within the Battalion perimeter. Suddenly the helicopter came under heavy automatic weapons fire from the enemy and was destroyed, and the jungle erupted in gunfire all around the defensive perimeter. The leading elements of the patrol were caught in this initial concentration of murderous fire. The Viet Cong forces, supported by a tremendous volume of automatic weapons, mortar and artillery fire, attacked all around the perimeter. The enemy exerted considerable force at a point between Company ""A"" and Company ""C"" in an effort to effect a breakthrough at this location.
Personnel of the two companies, including the wounded, steadfastly remained in their positions, responded at close quarters with fire that was both deadly and accurate, and succeeded in breaking up the determined enemy attack. Maintaining continuous contact around the perimeter, the Viet Cong launched another strong attack to breach the defenses. This effort was focused on the center and left flank of Company ""B"". Time and time again the Viet Cong charged the positions, but the indefatigable and determined paratroopers of Company ""B"" exacted heavy casualties and beat back the enemy attackers.
Regrouping and concentrating their forces, the Viet Cong made a final assault on the flank of Company ""C"". This time the desperate Viet Cong ran forward in waves under the protective umbrella of a heavy volume of their supporting fires. Again, however, the gallant and resolute paratroopers repulsed the enemy, inflicting severe losses, completely disrupting his efforts to destroy the Battalion, and forcing the Viet Cong to withdraw. Documentary evidence indicates that the attacking force consisted of the entire Viet Cong 271st Main Force Regiment, reinforced by two artillery battalions. A total of 303 Viet Cong dead were confirmed by body count. An estimated additional 150 were killed and numerous Viet Cong were wounded during the battle. The courageous and exemplary actions of the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry, in decisively defeating a determined, numerically superior, and well trained and equipped enemy force reflect great credit on the members of the Unit and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Army.

CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE MEDAL FOR MERIT TO FRED M. VINSON
FRED M. VINSON, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the United States from May 1943, to June, 1946. Mr. Vinson demonstrated the peculiarly exacting qualities of statesmanship needed in a global war whose economics and organizational complexities created problems of a scope hitherto unknown to history. To the people he was a human symbol of the strength of American leadership, and to the two commanders-in-chief he served, he was one of the Nation's greatest contributors to victory in the war and to the successful reconversion to peace afterwards. In personality, in speech, in the tone and justice of wartime decisions whose wisdom have since been amply proved, he displayed solid knowledge of detail governed by a true perspective and a shrewd eye to the over-all needs of the Nation. His outstanding qualities as administrator, negotiator and conciliator were rooted deep in American character, and his words and acts, determining some of the greatest decisions of the war and postwar period, had their base in the principles that go back to the founding fathers. As the Director of the Office of Economic Stabilization he kept America's war economy pointed to victory without the concomitant chaos that had been the major disease of production in past wars. Few Americans contributed so much to the check of inflation during the war as this economist, financial expert and lawyer with the judicial mind, the broad-gauge imagination and the simple American talent for practical judgment. His policies as Director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion lubricated the Nation's transition from the overwhelmingly strenuous war effort in the two-front war to the reduced pace required after Germany's capitulation and before Japan's surrender. He directed the liquidation of the Nation's nervous strain finally from total war to total peace so that the change created a pattern of economic smoothness and harmony unparalleled in previous postwar periods and hardly anticipated in this one. As Secretary of the Treasury, he maintained the same high level of statesmanship, carrying his talents into the international field. The job he had done before as a leader in America's war and reconversion economy he now repeated on an international plane in the effort to rehabilitate world economy. Here, and in every post to which his President and his country assigned him, Mr. Vinson sustained the reputation that he had securely established as one of the foremost Americans of his generation.

With his unit ambushed by an intense concentration of enemy mortar and small-arms fire, and suffering heavy casualties, he was forced to seek cover with the remaining members of the patrol in a near-by trench line. Determined to save his comrades when a hostile grenade was hurled into their midst, he unhesitatingly threw himself on the deadly missile, absorbing the shattering violence of the exploding charge in his own body and shielding his fellow Marines from serious injury or death. Gravely wounded as a result of his heroic action, Private First Class Simanek, by his daring initiative and great personal valor in the face of almost certain death, served to inspire all who observed him and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

The 42d Ranger Battalion, 21st Infantry Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in action while engaged in military operations against a hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam. On 17 May 1966, the 42d Ranger Battalion was committed in battle against the Viet Cong elite Soc Trang Provincial Battalion in the vicinity of Vinh Chau, Vietnam. After being helilifted into the objective area the Battalion moved tactically to establish contact with the insurgents. As advance elements cleared a heavy mangrove thicket, the Viet Cong opened fire from well-prepared defensive fortifications. The Battalion immediately countered the enemy fire, deployed its forces, and assaulted the positions, with the main effort to the north. The left flank of the Battalion received intense machine gun and small arms fire from enemy positions to the west, impeding their advance. Determining this to be the main core of enemy resistance, the Battalion maneuvered to engage the insurgents and advanced to the west against increasing resistance. 1st and 3d Companies assaulted the enemy's flank, but were able to make only small gains even in heavy hand-to-hand combat. To preserve the momentum of the attack, the Battalion Commander moved 2d Company into position with 4th Company at the center, and in a coordinated effort the Battalion assaulted, vigorously, the Viet Cong stronghold. The Viet Cong positions were staggered, with three separate lines of entrenchments concealed in thickly vegetated canal lines. In the face of murderous fire from these positions, the determined Rangers closed with the enemy and engaged him in fierce hand-to-hand combat until the objective had been cleared and the Viet Cong resistance silenced. Throughout this action, the Rangers demonstrated outstanding courage and professionalism. The conspicuous gallantry of the 42d Ranger Battalion is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam.

for service as set forth in the following
CITATION;
For exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 1 June 1966 to 18 February 1967 while conducting minesweeping operations in the Rung Sat Special Zone of the Republic of Vietnam. During this period, Mine Squadron ELEVEN, Detachment ALFA was responsible for keeping the Long Tau/Saigon shipping channel open to Military Sea Transportation Service and friendly merchant ships delivering large quantities of vital supplies to the Saigon port complex. As a direct result of the efforts of Mine Squadron ELEVEN, Detachment ALFA, only one merchantman was lost to an enemy mine. This superior operational record was achieved despite the fact that U.S. Naval Forces had not previously engaged in Riverine Warfare of this nature. Under the constant threat of mines exploding under their small craft, and ambushes by Viet Cong insurgents, Detachment ALFA personnel developed new concepts and tactics to carry out their hazardous and extraordinarily difficult mission. Enemy ambushes, launched from well-concealed positions on both river banks, brought units of Detachment ALFA under withering fire from automatic weapons and large-calibre recoilless rifles. Disregarding these perils, personnel of Detachment ALFA on numerous occasions maneuvered their lightly armed and armored craft to within point-blank range of enemy fire to conduct their highly effective minesweeps. After conducting their dangerous minesweeping throughout the day, Detachment ALFA personnel returned to work long and arduous hours at night, performing virtually all maintenance on their craft, including extensive hull repairs and engine replacements. Through supreme dedication and motivation, they maintained the exhausting tempo of daily operations. Their outstanding performance of duty, indomitable courage, and heroism, in the face of a determined enemy campaign to stop river traffic by destroying the United States Minesweeping capability in the Rung Sat Special Zone, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

During the period cited, the Squadron was given the mission of conducting a reconnaissance in a vast, heavily defended area extending from the South China Sea, west to the Kim Son River in the coastal plains region of central Vietnam. Elements of a North Vietnamese army division were believed to be located in this area. The Squadron conducted a series of classic cavalry operations, comparable with any recorded in the United States military history, with devastating effects on all Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army units engaged. By the unparalleled application of exceptional imagination, fearless courage, and unrelenting determination, the Squadron succeeded in locating the enemy units within the vast area. The Squadron conducted air and ground reconnaissance with its 88 organic armed helicopters, highly mobile organic rifle platoons and other attached non-organic infantry elements. Scouting over the area, the Squadron aggressively engaged every enemy force encountered, regardless of its size. On 2 October 1966, a rifle platoon on a reconnaissance mission engaged an estimated enemy battalion-size force and annihilated approximately onethird of the numerically superior force in the first few hours of contact. The Squadron developed a major portion of all targets successfully destroyed by the Division throughout the period.

For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government of the United States in a duty of great responsibility from July 1944 to November 1952. With a solid background of several years of experience as an Intelligence Officer in the United States Naval Reserve and qualified professionally and intellectually to render a vital service to the cause of national security, Rear Admiral Souers, as Assistant Chief of Naval Intelligence in Charge of Plans and Deputy Chief of Naval Intelligence during the period July 1944 to January 1946, served as a representative of the Secretary of the Navy on a special committee whose recommendations with respect to the formation of a government-wide central intelligence culminated in the creation of the National Intelligence Authority and the Central Intelligence Group. Postponing a return to private life, he became the first Director of Central Intelligence and remained with this group from January to July 1946, during which time the new organization was firmly established.
Responding to a request of the Atomic Energy Commission within a few months after his return to private life, Rear Admiral Souers conducted a thorough survey of the intelligence requirements of the Commission during the period May through August 1947 and submitted a plan resulting in the creation of an intelligence unit within the Commission and the coordination of the activities of that unit with the Central Intelligence Group. As First Executive Secretary of the New National Security Council from September 1947 to January 1950, he utilized his vast knowledge of the problems of national security and his marked ability to achieve cooperation among all groups operating in this field to successfully integrate the functions of the Council with those of other governmental agencies and to coordinate all governmental activities in the field of internal security. After accomplishing his mission of establishing the National Security Council on a sound basis, he relinquished his role as Executive Secretary and became a special consultant to the President of the United States on problems affecting the nation's security. His brilliant administrative ability, keen foresight and tireless efforts toward the fulfillment of a strong and effective security program reflect the highest credit upon Rear Admiral Souers and the United States Naval Service.

The 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division and the attached and assigned units distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism while engaged in military operations on 21 March 1967 in Suoi Tre, Republic of Vietnam. During the early morning hours the Viet Cong 272d Main Force Regiment, reinforced, launched a massive and determined ground attack and overran elements of the 3d Battalion, 22d Infantry, and 2d Battalion, 77th Artillery, located at Fire Support Base Gold near Suoi Tre, Republic of Vietnam. As the enemy penetrated the perimeter, the American troops set up an interim perimeter and continued to fire on the enemy. When the Viet Cong directed anti-tank fire upon the artillery positions, heroic gun crews repaired their damaged guns and, at several points, fired directly into the advancing enemy. While the battle continued to rage and grow in intensity, the Brigade Commander was directing the 2d Battalion of the 12th Infantry, the 22d Infantry (Mechanized), and the 34th Armor, to the besieged fire support base. At the same time, the support and service elements of the brigade began a furious aerial resupply of ammunition and medical supplies from the brigade rear base camp at Dau Tieng. As the 2d Battalion, 12th Infantry, began its overland move to the fire support base, a heavy concentration of enemy mortar fire was directed upon their positions. Concurrently, mechanized and armor elements began moving across the Suoi Samat River at a ford which had only recently been located and which previously had been thought impassable. The mechanized unit, followed by the armor battalion, drove into the western sector of the engaged perimeter passing through engaged elements of the 2d Battalion, 12th Infantry. Striking the Viet Gong on the flank, the 2d Battalion, 22d Infantry, smashed through the enemy with such intensity and ferocity that the enemy attack faltered and broke. As the fleeing and now shattered enemy force retreated to the northeast, the 2d Battalion, 34th Armor swept the position destroying large numbers of Viet Cong. Throughout the battle, fighters of the United States Air Force, directed by the brigade's forward air controllers, provided close support to the fire support base and hammered enemy concentrations outside the perimeter. As the Forward Air Controller aircraft dived through heavy anti-aircraft fire to mark enemy positions, the plane was hit by ground fire, and crashed. After securing the fire support base, a sweep of the area was conducted, revealing a total of 647 Viet Cong bodies and 10 enemy captured. It is estimated that an additional 200 enemy were killed as a result of the aerial and artillery bombardments. Friendly casualties were extremely light, resulting in only 33 killed and 187 wounded. Through their fortitude and determination, the personnel of the 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, and attached units were able in great measure to cripple a large Viet Cong force. Their devotion to duty and extraordinary heroism reflect distinct credit upon themselves and the Armed Forces of the United States.

CITATION:
For outstanding contributions to the United States and science in the field of oceanographic research.
These officers and distinguished scientists are richly deserving of the appreciation and acclaim of the Government and the people of the United States. Their marked professional skill and resourcefulness, their scientific studies and courageous efforts while conducting operations at great personal risk, culminated on 23 January 1960 in a dive by the bathyscaph Trieste to the unprecedented depth of 37,800 feet, the deepest spot on the ocean floor known to man. This dive and others before it were made in the interest of science and to collect data for the United States Navy in this previously unexplored area of the earth. This, the first penetration of the deepest parts of the ocean, impressively demonstrates that the United States is in the forefront of oceanographic research.
As President of the United States, I extend the nation's recognition and gratitude for your resourcefulness, courage and devotion to duty and your contributions to our country and to all free men. I offer my personal congratulations.

SECOND LIEUTENANT GEORGE H. O'BRIEN, JR.,
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE,
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Rifle Platoon Commander of Company H, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 27 October 1952. With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill position on the main line of resistance which had been overrun by a numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, Second Lieutenant O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was given and, shouting for his men to follow, raced across an exposed saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly small-arms, artillery and mortar fire. Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile automatic-weapons fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position, he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward and continued to spearhead the assault, pausing only long enough to go to the aid of a wounded Marine. Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl hand grenades into the bunkers and, utilizing his carbine to best advantage in savage hand-to-hand combat, succeeded in killing at ]east three of the enemy. Struck down by the concussion of grenades on three occasions during the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for a period of nearly four hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and maintaining superb direction of the unit. With the attack halted, he set up a defense with his remaining forces to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position, attending to the wounded and expediting their evacuation. When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he remained to cover the withdrawal and to assure that no wounded were left behind. By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of overwhelming odds, Second Lieutenant O'Brien served as a constant source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

During this period aircrew members and support personnel demonstrated exceptional valor and outstanding devotion to duty in the face of extremely difficult circumstances. Flying over 11,000 sorties, many against the most heavily defended targets in North Vietnam, the Wing expended 36,091 tons of bombs, 22,224 rockets, 101 missiles and 1,160,000 rounds of 20 mm ammunition to inflict severe damage to a major military complex, an enemy arsenal, key transportation facilities, surface-to-air missile sites and major fuel storage areas. These sorties destroyed large quantities of war materiel and made the enemy's movement of equipment, personnel and supplies into South Vietnam more costly and difficult. In addition, two enemy aircraft were destroyed and eight were damaged in aerial combat. Support personnel of the Wing not only were able to maintain the high sortie rate despite the severe weather conditions and battle damage to the aircraft but also made major improvements in the base to greatly increase its efficiency and to increase its capacity three-fold.

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION (ARMY) FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM TO THE 1ST SQUADRON, 4TH CAVALRY, 1ST INFANTRY DIVISION
The 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 1st Infantry Division distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against hostile forces in Birth Long Province, Republic of Vietnam during the period June to July 1966. On 8 June 1966, Troop A, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry was moving north along Highway 13 to the vicinity of An Loc to conduct area reconnaissance and offensive operations. The lead tank was hit by a command detonated mine which was the signal for three Viet Cong battalions to open a full-scale attack from both sides of the road. The three Viet Cong battalions occupied defensive fortifications and were heavily equipped with recoilless rifles, automatic weapons and a variety of small arms. Troop A immediately closed with the insurgent force in a fierce assault. Maneuver room was limited due to marshy terrain on either side of the highway. Continuous, multi-direction assaults were attempted by the desperate insurgent forces, but in each case they were halted by accurate tank, automatic, and individual weapons fire. With an indomitable fighting spirit, continuous fire and movement was used to steadily close on the insurgent force. The courageous fighting of the cavalrymen routed the Viet Cong from their emplacements. The gallant actions of Troop A in this six-hour battle was an eminent success. In addition, the armed helicopters of Troop D, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, the supporting artillery, and Air Force fighter aircraft contributed immeasurably to the success of the battle by bringing devastating fire on the Viet Cong. The actions resulted in a count of 105 insurgents killed and a large number of Viet Cong weapons captured. On the morning of 30 June 1966, Troops B and C were conducting armed reconnaissance north of An Loc on Highway 13, when they were struck by a Viet Cong regiment. The insurgent force poured a volume of mortar, recoilless rifle and automatic weapons fire into the column from the front and two sides. Fire was immediately returned by the Squadron, engaging the Viet Cong at point-blank range. The insurgents, concealed next to the road, made repeated attempts to overrun the Squadron by use of hand grenades at close range, point-blank firing, and fanatical assaults. Maneuver by the cavalrymen was again severely hampered by dense brush and marshy soil and they were forced to conduct their fight from extremely vulnerable positions. Although four platoon leaders were killed or wounded in the first hour, the gallant stand of the cavalrymen resulted in total defeat of the hostile force, whose scattered survivors fled from the battlefield. On the morning of 9 July, the Squadron's B, C, and D troops deployed southwest of An Loc to lure the insurgents into contact. The reinforced Viet Cong regiment, again covered in the heavy growth along the road, launched a powerful attack under the cover of intense mortar, small arms, automatic weapons, and grenades and .50 caliber machine gun fire. The intensity of the threehour fight equaled the two earlier and longer engagements. The lack of proximate landing zones for the infantry delayed the planned reinforcement and required the Squadron to bear the entire force of the numerically superior insurgent force attack for two hours. The cavalrymen, with immediately responsive and continuous support by air and artillery, heroically stood their ground and broke the Viet Cong attack. The determination displayed by the 1st Squadron, 4th United States Cavalry during the three decisive battles of operation El Paso II resulted in significant victories. The Squadron's indomitable courage resulted in 712 confirmed hostile dead, an estimated 850 additional killed, and large quantities of captured weapons and equipment. The conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism of the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 1st Infantry Division is in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon all who participated in these significant battles.

for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong forces in the Republic of Vietnam, from 11 May 1965 to 15 September 1967. Throughout this period, the First Marine Aircraft Wing, operating in I and II Corps tactical -zones of the Republic of Vietnam, North Vietnam, and adjacent waters, sought out and destroyed determined enemy forces and provided combat air support to ground forces of the Free World and the Republic of Vietnam. Participating in 195 major operations, and thousands of other attacks, the Wing continuously and aggressively carried the battle to the elusive enemy in bitterly contested actions. Operations such as DOUBLE EAGLE, HARVEST MOON, STARLITE, HASTINGS, PRAIRIE, UNION, HICKORY, COCHISE, AND SWIFT, reflect the high degree of superior airmanship, valor, devotion to duty and professionalism exhibited by personnel of the Wing. Although heavily committed to increased combat operations, the Wing developed and successfully employed new weapons, tactics, and procedures against the hard-core communist forces with gratifying results. Through the aggressive actions of the Wing, military and political victories were denied the insurgent communist forces, thereby providing a more stable atmosphere for the legally constituted Government of the Republic of Vietnam. The establishment, and logistical support of many separate airfields throughout the I Corps tactical zone and the vital air supply support provided the III Marine Amphibious Force and its allied ground forces, was a tribute to the resourcefulness and determination of the Wing. This dependable support was provided under the most trying and difficult combat conditions. Flying in fair weather and foul, against a fanatical, well-armed enemy, the uncommon courage and intrepidity of the Marine pilots and supporting Wing personnel, acting in a concerted team effort, contributed to another glorious chapter in an already illustrious history. The valor, devotion to duty, aggressive spirit, professionalism, and ingenuity of the entire First Marine Aircraft Wing in battle against a well trained, dangerous, and determined enemy, reflected the highest degree of heroism and exemplary performance, and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.

Lieutenant Wilson, Infantry, United States Army, a member of Company 1, 31st Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and indomitable courage above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy near Hwach'onMyon, Korea, on 5 June 1951. Company I was committed to attack and secure commanding terrain stubbornly defended by a numerically superior hostile force emplaced in well-fortified positions. When the spearheading element was pinned down by withering hostile fire, he dashed forward and, firing his rifle and throwing grenades, neutralized the position denying the advance and killed four enemy soldiers manning submachine guns. After the assault platoon moved up, occupied the position and a base of fire was established, he led a bayonet attack which reduced the objective and killed approximately twenty-seven hostile soldiers. While friendly forces were consolidating the newly-won gain, the enemy launched a counterattack and Lieutenant Wilson, realizing the imminent threat of being overrun, made a determined lone-man charge, killing seven and wounding two of the enemy, and routing the remainder in disorder. After the position was organized, he led an assault carrying to approximately fifteen yards of the final objective, when enemy fire halted the advance. He ordered the platoon to withdraw and, although painfully wounded in this action, remained to provide covering fire. During an ensuing counterattack, the commanding officer and first platoon leader became casualties. Unhesitatingly, Lieutenant Wilson charged the enemy ranks and fought valiantly, killing three enemy soldiers with his rifle before it was wrested from his hands, and annihilating four others with his entrenching tool. His courageous delaying action enabled his comrades to reorganize and effect an orderly withdrawal. While directing evacuation of the wounded, he suffered a second wound, but elected to remain on the position until assured that all of the men had reached safety.

(AIRMOBILE), UNITED STATES ARMY
The 1st Battalion (Airborne), 12th Cavalry, and attached units distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in combat actions in the Republic of Vietnam on 2-3 October 1966. Early on 2 October 1966, the Battalion was diverted to the village of Hoa Hoi where two helicopters had been shot down. After a quick reconnaissance, the battalion commander commenced the air assault, moving his three rifle companies into positions around the enemy held village. Two platoons of Company B were in the initial air movement, and these elements came under heavy enemy small arms fire upon landing. Unhesitatingly, the men charged straight into the well entrenched enemy and pushed them back toward the village. As Company B was fighting its way into Hoa Hoi from the southeast, Company A landed to the southwest. Receiving sniper fire on the landing zone, the company immediately attacked toward the village. At this point operations were halted, and loudspeakers were used to direct the civilians away from the village and to implore the enemy soldiers to lay down their arms. Numerous civilians and soldiers did as they were directed. After an hour, it was evident that no one else was coming out of the village, and the advance was continued. The fighting was marked by violent platoon size encounters as the companies attacked through a series of well fortified enemy trenches before reaching the enemy's main village stronghold. In the meanwhile, Company C completed the encirclement, landing north of the village and attacking south. Using the same aggressive, offensive tactics employed by the other companies, Company C fought its way through rice paddies and enemy fortifications to reach its blocking positions. It became evident that the three rifle companies could not contain the enemy during the approaching night, and Companies A and C, 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, were air lifted into the area to seal off the enemy village. During the night, the enemy made numerous attempts to break out of the perimeter, but were unable to penetrate the valiant ring of soldiers. At daybreak, Company C, 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry, began the main attack through the village while the remainder of the force continued to encircle the enemy. Despite the heavy volume of deadly fire from the well entrenched, tenacious foe, the heroic troopers moved steadily forward, and position after position collapsed under their assault. By noon, the final sweep of Hoa Hoi was completed. Because the Battalion aggressively carried the battle to the enemy with uncounted incidents of individual gallantry, friendly casualties were minimized compared with near total destruction of the entrapped enemy force. The determination and extraordinary courage displayed by the men of the participating units reflect great credit upon the 1st Cavalry Division and the United States Army.

MEDAL FOR MERIT TO BYRON PRICE
FOR EXCEPTIONALLY meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services as Director, Office of Censorship, from December 20, 1941, until August 15, 1945• Faced by a choice on one hand of instituting a system of voluntary censorship with the attendant danger to our military effort from careless publication or broadcast and, on the other hand, the only alternative of compulsory censorship which carried the potentiality of blacking-out the freedom of the press for the duration, Mr. Price chose to exercise his faith in the integrity of the personnel and organizations responsible for the communication of news to the public by Initiating an experiment in wartime censorship unique in its inception and execution, previously untried in any country. Throughout this period the total American war effort was shared in its individual parts by thousands and frequently by millions of people; ships, planes, troops, munitions and supplies were assembled and moved to war theaters in overwhelming force; submarines raided the enemy's far flung supply lines; German and Japanese submarines were hunted down and destroyed by a combination of tactics, weapons and devices that could similarly have been used against us; scientific laboratories developed and factories produced radar and the atomic bomb and they were put to devastating use; knowledge of these vast activities was in possession of press and radio media and was voluntarily withheld from publication or broadcast. By his distinctive and complete success in discharging his responsibilities as Director of Censorship, Mr. Price has demonstrated the strength of this country in its unity in time of stress and has contributed vitally to our hold upon one of the freedoms for which we were fighting and essential to our democratic way of life--the freedom of the press.

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 514TH TACTICAL FIGHTER SQUADRON REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM AIR FORCE FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM AND OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF DUTY
The 514th Tactical Fighter Squadron, a unit of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, is cited for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in combat against an armed enemy of the Republic of Vietnam throughout the period 1 January 1964 to 28 February 1965. Participating in daily actions in support of Republic of Vietnam ground operations, the courageous men of the 514th Tactical Fighter Squadron carried out their attacks on military targets with indomitable spirit and determination. The fierce determination to destroy the enemy displayed by the men of this unit was exemplified in the 6,000 sorties, and 13,000 flying hours compiled in support of ground operations during this period. Frequently, aircraft were landed just long enough to secure additional armament before continuing their attacks against the Communist aggressors threatening their homeland. The determined and daring attacks launched by the valiant men of the 514th Tactical Fighter Squadron against the heavily armed and fanatical Communist insurgents, in the face of fierce ground fire, had a demoralizing effect upon the enemy, raised the morale and fighting spirit of the supported ground troops, resulted in inestimable damage to the Communist aggressors in the loss of men and material, and were instrumental in stemming the tide of Communist aggression against the Republic of Vietnam during this period. While a ground count of the many enemy killed and wounded was impossible, the heavy losses inflicted upon the enemy by this unit are known to have been significant, severely restricting his ability or desire to conduct sustained ground operations. Despite being called upon to provide key personnel to cadre the organization of three additional fighter squadrons during this period, the 514th Tactical Fighter Squadron continued to carry out every assigned mission. The actions of the 514th Tactical Fighter Squadron reflect conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on the Republic of Vietnam.

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 44TH RANGER BATTALION REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM ARMED FORCES FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
The 44th Ranger Battalion is cited for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against a hostile force in Chuong Thien Province, Vietnam on 6 April 1965. On this date the 44th Ranger Battalion was reserve element of a larger force engaged in a search and destroy operation against two Viet Cong force battalions. At 1030 hours the Battalion was lifted by helicopter into battle when the lead infantry battalion accompanied by an armored personnel carrier troop were halted by intense fire delivered on their positions by the well-entrenched and camouflaged enemy. Although the enemy delivered withering machine gun fire on the men of the 44th Ranger Battalion as they entered the landing zone, they showed undaunted courage and indomitable fighting spirit as they immediately launched an assault through the infantry and armored units, freeing them for future commitment. Despite numerous casualties, this gallant unit carried out their fierce assault against an estimated enemy battalion. After routing the determined insurgents from their position by demoralizing hand-to-hand combat, the 44th Ranger Battalion turned their heroic attack directly into the main enemy defensive positions located on a main canal. In spite of the loss of their executive officer, a U.S. Army Advisor, and three helicopters during the lift, the remainder of the battalion pursued the attack with undaunted courage and steadfast determination against the fanatical forces manning the main defense. They succeeded in rolling up the flank of the enemy and causing them to withdraw in confusion, leaving behind over fifty dead and numerous weapons. The determined, courageous heliborne assault by the 44th Ranger Battalion was the major contribution to the success of the operation and was of the highest inspirational order. The actions of the 44th Ranger Battalion reflect conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on the Republic of Vietnam.

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 197TH AVIATION COMPANY UNITED STATES ARMY FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM IN VIETNAM
The 197th Aviation Company (Armed Helicopter) is cited for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against a hostile force near Duc Hoa, Republic of Vietnam during the period 1 through 3 April 1965. This Unit was operating in a Viet Cong infested area with the hazardous mission of selecting, reconnoitering, marking and providing suppressive fire on helicopter landing zones in support of ground forces of the Republic of Vietnam. At about 1400 hours on 1 April, the Unit was providing overhead cover for the first troop landing. As the troop carriers departed the landing zone, strong enemy automatic weapons fire was received. One unit aircraft was hit early in the fighting; the co-pilot was seriously wounded and the aircraft suffered major damage. During the conduct of subsequent troop landing and overhead cover missions, the Unit's helicopters continued to receive heavy automatic weapons fire which damaged six additional aircraft. In spite of the damage and casualties sustained, the aircraft were refueled, rearmed, and returned to action. During the afternoon the ground forces were heavily engaged and required helicopter fire support as well as armed escort for medical evacuation and resupply missions. These escorts were performed in a timely and efficient manner notwithstanding the continuous Viet Cong automatic weapons fire received. As darkness fell, a Viet Cong attack penetrated friendly positions resulting in the death of two U.S. Army Ground Advisors and the separation of another from his Unit; one helicopter landed in the face of heavy ground fire and rescued the Advisor. At daybreak on 2 April the Company resumed its missions. During the day reconnaissance and suppressive fire were provided for two additional troop lifts into separate landing zones. Again intense enemy fire was encountered and three aircraft sustained combat damage. The Viet Cong broke contact during the night. At about noon on 3 April a successful effort was made to regain contact by landing Republic of Vietnam forces to the rear of the insurgents. Again, landing zone reconnaissance and suppression were accomplished in the face of extremely heavy Viet Cong ground fire. The dogged determination, gallantry and indomitable spirit with which the 197th Aviation C o m p a n y successfully accomplished all assigned missions in the face of violent insurgent fire are in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit on all members of the Unit who participated in this remarkable combat action.

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 883D REGIONAL FORCE COMPANY REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM FOR EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
The 883D Regional Force Company, a unit of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Vietnam is cited for extraordinary heroism in combat near Ha Tay, Binh Dinh Province, Republic of Vietnam on 10 March 1965. The 883D Regional Force Company was assigned the defense of the village of Ha Tay as a part of the overall defense of the important district town of Hoai An. At 0300 hours on 9 March the 883D Company, with a strength of only 71 men, was attacked by a Viet Cong battalion of vastly superior strength. It was the Viet Cong plan to overrun Ha Tay and join forces with another battalion to seize Hoai An district headquarters occupying a narrow ridge above Ha Tay. The 883D Company withstood repeated enemy assaults, all of which were supported by intense mortar and recoilless rifle fire. Through the morning this unit made its gallant stand unaided by outside fire support. By 1100 hours, the Company had sustained over 30 killed in action or seriously wounded and had nearly exhausted its ammunition and grenades. The members of the Company were undaunted. They hid their automatic weapons and in a final desperate charge broke out of their encircled position to join a larger Vietnamese unit. This gallant stand completely disrupted the Viet Cong attack. The battalion attacking Ha Tay was prevented from joining the attack on Hoai An. Hoai An was saved and friendly forces gained time in which to mount a counterattack from outside the battle area. The counterattack was successful in driving the enemy from the area. The dogged defense of Ha Tay by the 883D Regional Force Company resulted in the death Of 221 Viet Cong and the capture of two machine guns. A vastly superior force had been held at bay for eleven hours and a major enemy attack had been disrupted. The actions of the 883D Regional Force Company reflect conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit on the Republic of Vietnam.

THE PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO THE 1ST AIR COMMANDO SQUADRON 34TH TACTICAL GROUP, 2D AIR DIVISION, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE FOR OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF DUTY AND EXTRAORDINARY HEROISM
The 1st Air Commando Squadron is cited for outstanding performance of duty and extraordinary heroism while providing day and night training, combat and combat service support to units of the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces who were in conflict against an armed enemy throughout the Reo public of Vietnam during the period 1 August 1964 through 15 April 1965. During this period the C-47 section of the 1st Air Commando Squadron, with a total of only 6 C-47 aircraft and in the face of heavy enemy ground fire flew 3,763 sorties, airlifting 2,187,000 pounds of cargo and 16,862 passengers and airdropping 1,000,000 pounds of cargo and 1,125 troops. Ground lighting missions totalled 3,341 flares. The U10 psychological warfare section of the 1st Air Commando Squadron, consisting of only 3 aircraft, during the same period flew 1,600 loudspeaker and leaflet dropping sorties. These extremely hazardous missions were carried out without regard for intensive efforts by the enemy to silence the voice of truth. The AIE section of the 1st Air Commando Squadron flew 6,700 missions while training VNAF pilots in ground support missions, braving intense enemy fire from hard core Communist troops threatening friendly ground units. The intensity of antiaircraft fire and the dangers posed by entrenched and well armed insurgents did not daunt or deter the 1st Air Commando Squadron, day or night, in their collective determination to support, beyond the expected endurance of man or machine, the courageous soldiers of the Republic of Vietnam ground forces. The gallantry, courage, ability and indomitable fighting spirit displayed by the 1st Air Commando Squadron reflect great credit upon the members of the unit and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Air Force.

SECOND LIEUTENANT RAYMOND G. MURPHY,
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE,
for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Platoon Commander of Company A, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 3 February 1953. Although painfully wounded by fragments from an enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and well-entrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground, Second Lieutenant Murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small-arms fire, skillfully maneuvering his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement. Undeterred by the increasing intense enemy fire, he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire-swept hill to direct evacuation teams to the wounded, personally carrying many of the stricken Marines to safety. When reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements, Second Lieutenant Murphy employed part of his unit as support and, during the ensuing battle, personally killed two of the enemy with his pistol. With all the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage, he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces off the hill and, though suffering intense pain from his previous wounds, seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared in the trenches. After reaching the base of the hill, he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing Marines, locating and carrying the bodies of a machine-gun crew back down the hill. Wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small-arms, artillery and mortar fire, he again refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men, including all casualties, had preceded him to the main lines. His resolute and inspiring leadership, exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon Second Lieutenant Murphy and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty during the Battle of Phung Du on 7, 8 and 9 April 1965. Surrounded by numerically superior Communist insurgent (Viet Cong) forces, the Second Battalion, Vietnamese Marine Brigade, with valiant and indomitable fighting spirit repulsed wave after wave of fanatical enemy assaults thrust at the Brigade defensive positions from multiple directions.
In the face of heavy and repeated infantry attacks, and under a hail of intense mortar and machine-gun fire hurled against their positions throughout the night and in the early morning darkness, the men of the Second Battalion responded most courageously to their magnificent leadership and fought from foxhole to foxhole in hand-to-hand combat with fierce determination against overwhelming odds.
With inspiring individual bravery in the face of the enemy penetration of their defensive perimeter, they launched counterattacks which swept the advancing foe before them by bayonet and small-arms fire, decimating their ranks and driving them into a general rout leaving the battlefield littered with hundreds of enemy dead.
Their valor, teamwork, and aggressive fighting spirit transformed a defensive battle into a crushing defeat of the Viet Cong, who were forced into disorganized retreat.

The 2d Battalion, 31st Regiment, 21st Infantry Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam, distinguished itself by gallantry in action while engaged in military operations in Chuong Thien Province, Republic of Vietnam on 4 September 1966. Employed as a heliborne reaction force during operation Dan Chi, the 2d Battalion inflicted a serious defeat on the enemy. Another ARVN infantry battalion was pinned down in an open rice paddy in a savage fight against a main force Viet Cong battalion reinforced with a local guerrilla company. The total estimated enemy strength was over one thousand men. The enemy was fighting from well-prepared log and mud entrenchments with mutually supporting fields of fire across open rice paddies. The 2d Battalion was ordered to move into the operational area to reinforce the sister battalion and attack along the friendly forces' left flank into the left sector of the objective. The enemy attempted to ward off this attack on their flank by placing additional troops into position directly to the front of the 2d Battalion. Due to the increased intensity of enemy fire, the total deployment of the 2d Battalion required one hour and fifteen minutes. Upon completion of this deployment, rapid reorganization permitted the unit to attack almost immediately. Without the assistance of artillery, air strikes or armed helicopter support, the 2d Battalion assaulted across 600 meters of open rice paddies. Advancing upon heavily fortified positions, the 2d Battalion was engaged by six enemy machine guns. All organic support weapons were employed in the destruction of these positions. Now within 100 meters of the wood line, the 2d Battalion closed with the enemy in ferocious hand to hand combat. The pride, courage and determination of these brave soldiers, coupled with outstanding leadership at all echelons, routed the enemy from his positions, resulting in 105 enemy killed in action. The dedication and unit professionalism which characterized the performance of the Battalion was instrumental in the fierce and rapid destruction of the Viet Cong insurgents. The actions of the 2d Battalion, 31ST Regiment, were in the highest traditions of all fighting men and have reflected great credit upon the unit and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

The 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) and attached units distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in action against a hostile force in Dak To, Republic of Vietnam, during ""OPERATION HAWTHORNE"", 2 through 20 June 1966. ""OPERATION HAWTHORNE"" began on: June 1966 when the Brigade was directed to relieve the beleaguered mountain outpost of Tou Morong. The 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry teamed up with elements of the 24th Tactical Zone Command (42d Army of the Republic of Vietnam Regiment and 21st Ranger Battalion) to accomplish this phase of the operation. Intelligence reports received at Brigade Headquarters indicated a major enemy drive was under way to overrun the Central Highlands. At 0230 hours on the morning of 7 June 1966, an estimated North Vietnamese battalion of the 24th North Vietnamese Army Regiment savagely attacked an artillery position in the valley west of Tou Morong. The position was manned by Battery B, 2d Howitzer Battalion (Airborne), 320th Artillery; Company A, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 502d Infantry; and elements of Company A, 326th Engineer Battalion. The charging enemy was able to penetrate the artillery's perimeter. The battle that had the winner-take-all climax saw the valiant Americans secure their weapons and fire pointblank into the still charging North Vietnamese Army ranks. As dawn brought light to the exhausted warriors, 86 enemy bodies were counted, 13 of them inside the artillery position. After relieving the Tou Morong outpost, the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, moved north. Another bitter battle erupted, this time engaging all three of the infantry companies of the Battalion at one time, each in a separate fire fight. As the battle raged, the Battalion's elite Tiger Force was hard hit and almost overrun by an estimated two companies of heavily armed, well trained North Vietnamese Army Regulars. On 7 June 1966, the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 502d Infantry, was helilifted into a blocking position where it began a sweep south to link up with its heavily engaged sister Battalion. Throughout the battle, the enemy strength was fixed as a well trained North Vietnamese Army regiment. Their heavy weapons were strategically placed in sturdy bunkers which were spread out along the fingers and draws of the mountainside. As the battered but courageous 2d Battalion (Airborne), 502d Infantry companies regrouped and the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 327th Infantry, continued their relentless attack from the south, a decision was made to have B-52 Bombers strike Dak Tan Kan Valley before the Brigade moved in for the final kill. ""OPERATION HAWTHORNE"" was one of the most viciously contested battles of the Vietnam War. Day and night the battle raged, moving from bunker to trench line, to spider hole, to bamboo thicket, to stream bed, and finally, to victory. At the conclusion of ""OPERATION HAWTHORNE"" the 24th North Vietnamese Army Regiment was rendered ineffective as a fighting unit, suffering 1200 casualties by body count and estimate. By comparison, friendly casualties were 48 dead and 239 wounded. A major North Vietnamese offensive to seize the North Central Highlands was blunted. Throughout ""OPERATION HAWTHORNE"" the extraordinary heroism, dogged determination, gallantry, and indomitable spirit with which the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, successfully accomplished all assigned missions were in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit upon all members of the Brigade who participated in this remarkable combat action.

for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For heroism in connection with military operations against North Vietnamese Army forces in Quang Ngai Province, during the period 14 February to 22 February 1967. An enemy regiment, encircled by a tri-nation operation, launched a full-scale, predawn attack against the 7th Airborne Battalion on 19 February 1967, under weather conditions which prevented U.S. tactical air support. The 7th Airborne Battalion, in a matter of a few hours, was heavily engaged in repelling human-wave attacks from three sides in hand-to-hand combat. In spite of heavy casualties after a five-hour battle, the gallant paratroopers continued to counterattack deeper and deeper into the attacking force, alternately returning to their lines, as weather conditions permitted elements of fighter aircraft to make passes, and using captured weapons in their defense. With over 200 enemy dead lying on the 7th Airborne Battalion perimeter, the attackers continued to assault in an attempt to break through the hard-pressed Airborne lines. Following an emergency resupply by U.S. Marine Corps pilots, the South Vietnamese paratroopers successfully held their positions for another seven hours during determined enemy attacks. At the opportune time, the Airborne soldiers valiantly counterattacked in three directions from their positions, routed the enemy, killed many of the fleeing members of the North Vietnamese Army regiment, and captured huge quantities of weapons and equipment. Their determination was clearly evident, as individual soldiers refused to give ground to the enemy, and noncommissioned officers quickly took command where necessary. The gallantry and fighting ability of the 7th Airborne Battalion in the face of exceptionally strong enemy opposition, reflect great credit upon the Battalion and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.

CITATION FOR THE MEDAL OF HONOR
GENERAL JONATHAN M. WAINWRIGHT, Commanding United States Army forces in the Philippines from 12 March to 7 May 1942, distinguished himself by intrepid and determined leadership against greatly superior enemy forces. At the repeated risk of life above and beyond the call of duty in his position, he frequented the firing line of his troops where his presence provided the example and incentive that helped make the gallant efforts of these men possible. The final stand on beleaguered Corregidor, for which he was in an important measure personally responsible, commanded the admiration of the nation's allies. It reflected the high morale of American arms in the face of overwhelming odds. His courage and resolution were a vitally needed inspiration to the then sorely pressed freedom-loving peoples of the world.

The 41st Regimental Headquarters, 1st and 3d Battalions, 41st Regiment and the 3d Troop, 8th Reconnaissance Squadron, Army of the Republic of Vietnam, distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in action against a superior heavily armed enemy force in Van Dinh Thuong Hamlet, Binh Dinh Province, Republic of Vietnam on 23 September 1966. At 0300 hours on 23 September the Regiment was attacked by intense 82mm mortar, 60mm mortar, and 57mm recoilless rifle fire. Moments later the perimeter received a heavy volume of enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire. The enemy force, later determined to be a North Vietnam Army Battalion, attempted to penetrate the southern position of the perimeter only to be repelled by savage defensive fire. This same force mounted a second attack and again failed to penetrate the perimeter. With the 41st Regiment's attention attracted to the south, the northern portion of the perimeter was assaulted by human waves of another North Vietnam Army Battalion. This attack was successful and the perimeter was penetrated. Regimental forces became heavily engaged in hand to hand combat with the attack halted by the Regimental Reconnaissance Platoon within 30 meters of the Regimental Command Post. The perimeter was restored and the friendly forces held their positions until dawn. At this time the 41st Regimental Commander seized the initiative and counterattacked, with the 1st and 3d Battalions and the 3d Armored Personnel Carrier Troop, 8th Reconnaissance Squadron. The counterattack, in conjunction with air strikes, was successful and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy force. The action of the elements of the 41st Regiment in defeating the 7th and 8th Battalions of the 18th North Vietnam Army Regiment, a force equal to its own, ranks as one of the outstanding accomplishments in the Vietnamese conflict and is in the highest traditions of the Free World Forces.

TO THE 14TH AIR COMMANDO WING
The 14th Air Commando Wing, United States Air Force distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism, exceptional gallantry and outstanding performance of duty in action against hostile forces in Southeast Asia from 8 March 1966 to 7 March 1967. Flying thousands of widely diversified sorties, elements of the Wing caused many enemy casualties and destroyed or damaged more than 8,500 structures, 500 trucks and 60 fuel sites as well as numerous automatic weapon positions, radio stations, bridges and boats. Flying the venerable C-47 aircraft, one squadron of the Wing helped abort a large number of night hostile operations against friendly forts and hamlets through flare drops and minigun saturation fire. Despite the often heavy and accurate enemy antiaircraft fire, the search and rescue missions of the Wing recovered 91 skilled airmen during this period. In addition, the Wing's psychological warfare missions directly or indirectly influenced the surrender of thousands of enemy soldiers. Through their valorous acts and untiring devotion to mission accomplishment personnel of the Wing have equaled the highest standards of performance in the United States Air Force and their actions reflect credit upon themselves and the armed forces of their country.

for service as set forth in the following
CITATION:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Medical corpsman, serving with a Marine Rifle Company, in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea during the early morning hours of 27 March 1953. Participating in a fierce encounter with a cleverly concealed and well-entrenched enemy force occupying positions on a vital and bitterly contested outpost far in advance of the main line of resistance, CHARETTE repeatedly and unhesitatingly moved about through a murderous barrage of hostile small-arms and mortar fire to render assistance to his wounded comrades. When an enemy grenade landed within a few feet of a Marine he was attending, he immediately threw himself upon the stricken man and absorbed the entire concussion of the deadly missile with his own body. Although sustaining painful facial wounds, and undergoing shock from the intensity of the blast which ripped the helmet and medical aid kit from his person, CHARETTE resourcefully improvised emergency bandages by tearing off part of his clothing, and gallantly continued to administer medical aid to the wounded in his own unit and to those in adjacent platoon areas as well. Observing a seriously wounded comrade whose armored vest had been torn from his body by the blast from an exploding shell, he selflessly removed his own battle vest and placed it upon the helpless man although fully aware of the added jeopardy to himself. Moving to the side of another casualty who was suffering excruciating pain from a serious leg wound, CHARETTE stood upright in the trench line and exposed himself to a deadly hail of enemy fire in order to lend more effective aid to the victim and to alleviate his anguish while being removed to a position of safety. By his indomitable courage and inspiring efforts in behalf of his wounded comrades, CHARETTE was directly responsible for saving many lives. His great personal valor reflects the highest credit upon himself and enhances the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

First Lieutenant Edward R. Schowalter, Jr., 064 446, Infantry, United States Army, Commanding, Company A, gist Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and indomitable courage above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy near Kumhwa, Korea, on 14 October 1959. Committed to attack and occupy a key approach to the primary objective, the First Platoon of his company came under heavy vicious small arms, grenade and mortar fire within fifty yards of the enemy-held strong point, halting the advance and inflicting several casualties. The Second Platoon moved up in support at this juncture, and although wounded, Lieutenant Schowalter continued to spearhead the assault. Nearing the objective he was severely wounded by a grenade fragment but, refusing medical aid, he led his men into the trenches and began routing the enemy from the bunkers with grenades. Suddenly from a burst of fire from a hidden cave off the trench he was again wounded. Although suffering from his wounds, he refused to relinquish command and continued issuing orders and encouraging his men until the commanding ground was secured and then he was evacuated. Lieutenant Schowalter's unflinching courage, extraordinary heroism and inspirational leadership reflect the highest credit upon himself and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.

He voluntarily accompanied a contingent to locate and destroy a reported enemy outpost. Nearing the objective, the patrol was ambushed and suffered numerous casualties. Observing his wounded leader lying in an exposed position, he ordered the troops to withdraw, then braved intense fire to reach and assist him. While attempting evacuation, he was attacked by three hostile soldiers employing grenades and small arms fire. Quickly shifting his body to shelter the officer, he killed the assailants with his rifle, then carried the helpless man to safety. He was critically wounded and lost an eye in this action, but courageously returned through withering fire and bursting shells to assist the wounded and, while evacuating two comrades, closed with and killed three more of the foe. Private West's indomitable spirit, consummate valor and intrepid actions inspired all who observed him, reflecting highest credit upon himself and upholding the honored traditions of the military service.
