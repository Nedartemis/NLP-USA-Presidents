debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"It’s nothing but noise. What? Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, not withstanding a little, few technical difficulties, we’re thrilled to have you tonight. And we are very honored by the presence of our president, Donald Trump, who is going to walk in right now. We are about 30 seconds from air, so it’ll be just in time. Mr. President."
debate,Speaker 1,2020,This is an NBC news special presentation of Today with Savannah Guthrie.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Tonight, Donald Trump in the arena. His first prime time network appearance since falling ill with Coronavirus."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’m feeling great, I don’t know about you. How is everyone feeling?"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"With tonight’s debate canceled, the President faces our questions live and hears from voters about their concerns in the battleground state of Florida."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"It’s great to be back in my home state, Florida, to make my official return to the campaign trail."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"With just 19 days to go, the President makes his case."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family.
debate,Speaker 1,2020,"From NBC News, Decision 2020, President Trump Town Hall. Live from the Perez Art Museum in Miami, here’s Savannah Guthrie."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Hi everybody, and good evening. It’s good to have you with us, and welcome to Miami and our town hall with President Donald Trump. And we want to say right off the top, this is not how things were supposed to go tonight. This was supposed to be a town hall debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. But after the President contracted COVID, the debate commission announced it would have to be a virtual debate because of health concerns. The President then said he would not participate in a virtual debate. At that point, Joe Biden scheduled a town hall tonight in Pennsylvania on another network, and now the President is doing the same, his own town hall with the same venue format and time as NBC’s town hall with Joe Biden last week. So the two candidates go head to head tonight, though, not face to face, each in a key battleground state."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"And tonight, the President will be taking questions from voters here in Miami, who we should mention are socially distanced and they’re wearing masks. And I should say, this audience looks a bit like America, it’s divided. Some here voted for the president in 2016 and plan to again, some support Joe Biden, and some say they are truly undecided. We’re going to get a mix of questions on a range of topics, and we’re going to get to those questions in a moment. But first with all of that ado, welcome, Mr. President, and thank you for being here."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That was very well stated, I have to say. Good job."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Thank you. We’re glad you’re here, we’re glad you’re well. We send our best to the First Lady and to Barron."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Thank you, thank you."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Do you have any remaining symptoms from COVID?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Nothing whatsoever, I’m great, I feel good. I was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout, and I just feel really good. Florida, Pennsylvania, were- They said, “Let’s go to the hospital.” I said, “That’s okay. I’m going to respond to what you say.” And we went over to Walter Reed, where you have tremendous professionals. They gave me Regeneron and Remdeceiver both. And all I know is I felt good the following day, I felt really good."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Did the doctors ever tell you that they saw pneumonia on your lung scans?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, but they said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected, and-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Infected with?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t know. I mean, I didn’t do too much asking. I really felt good. I didn’t have much of a problem with the lungs. I did have a little bit of a temperature. Obviously, I felt there was something missing, and then I tested, I tested positive."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Well, let’s talk about testing because there’s a little bit of a, I guess, confusion about this. And I think we can clear it up."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Yeah, and there shouldn’t be."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Your first positive test was Thursday, October 1st, okay? When was your last negative test? When did you last remember having a negative test?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, I test quite a bit, and I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate, and I felt fantastically, I had no problems before."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Did you test the day of the debate?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t know, I don’t even remember. I test all the time. But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive. That’s when I first found out about it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Well back to the debate, because the debate commission’s rules, it was the honor system."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yeah.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Would be that you would come with a negative test. You say you don’t know if you’ve got a test on the day of the debate?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I had no problem. Again, the doctors do it. I don’t ask them. I test all the time. And they-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Did you take a test, though, on the day of the debate?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If you ask as the doctor, they’ll give you a perfect answer. But they take a test and I leave and I go about my business."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"So you did you take a test on the day of the debate, I guess is the bottom line?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I probably did, and I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate. And it was only after the debate, a period of time after the debate that I said, “That’s interesting.” And they took a test and it tested positive."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Just to button it up, do you take a test every single day?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No. No, but I take a lot of tests."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay. And you don’t know if you took a test the day of the debate?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Possibly I did, possibly I didn’t. But the doctor has very accurate information and it’s not only that doctor, it’s many doctors. The one thing, if you’re President, you have a lot of doctors you’re surrounded by. But I was in great shape for the debate. And sometime after the debate, I tested positive, then that’s when they decided to, let’s go."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Okay, good. I hopefully provided some clarity for folks. Let’s talk about the event that was held at the White House on the Saturday before you tested positive. Subsequent to that, 13 people connected to that event tested positive. There was an outdoor reception, you’ve seen the pictures. There was an indoor reception. People were not wearing masks. My question to you is, at this point in the pandemic, knowing what we know, shouldn’t you have known better? Shouldn’t the White House know better than to hold an event like that?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, they do a lot of testing in the White House, they test everybody including me, but they test everybody. And something happened. But as far as the mask is concerned, I’m good with masks. I’m okay with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it. So this is a very-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,It didn’t say that. I know that study.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That’s what I heard, and that’s what I saw. And regardless, but everybody’s tested and they’re tested often. And I also knew that, hey, I’m President. I have to see people. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be in a room. I can’t be… I have to be out."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"You can see people with a mask, though, right?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I can, but people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Well, there are pictures of Thom Tillis, actually with one of Judge Barrett’s kids not wearing a mask. But you know Chris Christie, he was part of your debate prep."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yeah.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"He was, I believe at that event. He came out tonight, he was sick, very sick. He was in the hospital for about a week."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Yes, I know this."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"He came out tonight and said, “I was wrong not to wear a mask.”"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, I mean, he has to say that. I think it’s great, he’s a friend of mine. He’s a good guy. And wrong or not wrong, you have to understand, as President, I can’t be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just stay and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Now, there was an event with the gold star families the day after the Supreme Court event."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"There was, exactly right. We had a gold star event with the most incredible people you’ve ever seen. And I could have chosen not to talk to them, or to keep everybody away. And you know what? I don’t think that’s probably where it was caught, but maybe it was."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"I going to say, you bring it up, you brought it up yourself. I mean, are you trying to suggest that? Do you believe a grieving military family gave you a COVID?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, I don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it came from, and the doctors don’t know where it came from. But as the President, I have to be out there. I also know-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Well, there’s no one that says you can’t be out there, but it’s just about wearing masks and having… For example, your rallies."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I know this.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Your rallies don’t require masks.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I mean, let’s see, Kamala. She’s got people now, people have it, and I’m not blaming her. I’m not saying, “Oh, she did a terrible thing.” As President, I have to be out there. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House. And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody. And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it. It is risky doing it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"But as President, you’re right. You want to be a leader, but you also are a leader and a setter of an example. And if you’re not wearing a mask when your administration is saying, “Best practice right now is wear a mask,” no, it’s not foolproof. But that will-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But many people are catching it. Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn’t have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this. And I mean, nobody’s being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world. Look at what’s going on in Europe, massive spikes. They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There’s tremendous spikes."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"But our death rate is worse than, well, not Spain, but those other countries."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, I have thing right here that will tell you exactly the opposite."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Me too.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"The UK is up 2500%, because I knew you’d be doing this. I know you very well. The UK is up 2500%. The EU is up 722%. And the United States is down 21%."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,But we have per… Our deaths per capita is among the highest of all-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excess mortality.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,I’m sorry?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excess mortality, we’re a winner on the excess mortality. And what we’ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job. And it’s rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming, and we have the therapies coming. And I’ll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice. Do nothing, or use some of the things that we’re looking at, like in this case, Regeneron. and Eli Lilly makes something that’s supposed to be incredible. And I think that maybe I wouldn’t be doing this discussion with you right now. We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,I want to pick up on something you just said. You said we’re rounding the corner.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I believe we’re rounding the corner, yes."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"10% of the country approximately has had COVID. That means 80%-90%, 90%, let’s do the math, is still vulnerable."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Right, right. That’s right."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"There’s been some talk, including from the White House lately that perhaps it approves of what’s called herd immunity. That’s where you basically just let young people and everybody gets sick. You try to protect the old people and those who are sick. And hopefully, it gets up to a certain level, and now we’re all immune."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yeah.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"So let’s just be clear about it. It also means more deaths. Do you support herd immunity as a strategy? Essentially, just let people get sick?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"The cure can not be worse than the problem itself. We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,000 people. One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. It happened because of China. And you have to get that and understand that. But it shouldn’t have happened. But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,00 people."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"That 2 million figure, though, is if you literally did nothing."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,We saved 2 million people.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"The 2 million figure is if you did absolutely nothing, it would be 2 million. The question is, should the deaths be better than 200,000, when-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t know, let me tell you what is happening. I left North Carolina, which I love. I left Pennsylvania. We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing. And I think they’re doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Look at what’s happening to New York. New York is a mess. They lost almost 40,000 people. They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen. Now they’re open, it’s like a ghost town. And Savannah, it’s very important. People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again. So that cure, that so called cure that you talk about, it can’t be worse than the problem. The problem is a bad problem."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,We’ve got more questions.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… than the problem. The problem is a bad problem.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,We’ve got more questions on COVID-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Okay, fine."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"… so let’s drop it, for now. We were supposed to, as mentioned, be watching you on a debate stage right now. We’re not doing that, so let’s clear up a few things from the last one. You were asked point blank to denounce white supremacy. In the moment, you didn’t. You asked some follow up questions. “Who, specifically?” A couple of days later, on a different show-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, you always do this."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,… you denounced white supremacy.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, you always do this."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,My question to you is-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You’ve done this to me, and everybody-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,… why does it seem like-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I denounce white supremacy. Okay?
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"You did, two days later."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’ve denounced white supremacy, for years, but you always do it. You always start off with the question. You didn’t ask Joe Biden, whether or not he denounces Antifa. I watched him on the same basic show with Lester Holt, and he was asking questions like Biden was a child."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Well, so this is a little bit of a dodge."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So, are you ready? Are you… Wait. Are you listening? I denounce white supremacy."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,What’s your next question?
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Do you feel, it feels sometimes you’re hesitant to do so, like you wait a beat."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Hesitant? Here we go again. Every time… In fact, my people came, “I’m sure they’ll ask you the white supremacy question.” I denounce white supremacy."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And frankly, you want to know something? I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities, that are run by Democrats who don’t know what they’re doing-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"All right, while we’re denouncing, let me ask you about QAnon. It is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior, of that. Now can you just, once and for all, state that that is completely not true, and-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So, I know [crosstalk 00:18:35]-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,… disavow QAnon-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yeah.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,… in its entirety?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I know nothing about QAnon.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,I just told you.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I know very little. You told me, but what you tell me, doesn’t necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it. If you’d like me to-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,They believe that it is a Satanic cult run by the deep state.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… study the subject. I’ll tell you what I do know about. I know about Antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are. And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Republican Senator Ben Sasse said, quote, “QAnon is nuts and real leaders call conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories.”"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He may be right.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Why not just say, it’s crazy and not true?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Can I be honest? He may be right. I just don’t know about QAnon.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,You do know.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t know. No, I don’t know. I don’t know. You tell me all about it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Let me ask you another thing.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Let’s waste the whole show. You start off with white supremacy. I denounce it. You start off with something else. Let’s go. Keep asking me these questions. But let me just-
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Okay, I do have one more in this vein."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… let me just tell you. What I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… and I agree with it very strongly.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,But there’s not a Satanic pedophile cult being run by-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I have no idea. I know nothing about them.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,You don’t know that? Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, I don’t know that."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"You, just this week-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And neither do you, know that."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Okay. Just this week, you retweeted-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Why aren’t you asking me about Antifa? Why aren’t you asking me about the radical left?
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Because you just, because you’re volunteering it."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Why aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn Antifa? Why does he say it doesn’t exist?"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Because you’re here, before me."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Antifa, no, excuse me. That’s so cute. Antifa exists. They’re vicious, they’re violent. They kill people, and they’re burning down our cities. And they happen to be radical left."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Just this week, you retweeted to your 87 million followers, a conspiracy theory that Joe Biden orchestrated to have SEAL Team Six, the Navy SEAL Team Six, killed to cover up the fake death of Bin Laden. Now, why would you send a lie like that to your followers?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I know nothing about it, can I [crosstalk 00:20:36]-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,You retweeted it.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody-
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,But-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,…. and that was a retweet. I’ll put it out there. People can decide for themselves. I don’t take a position.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"I don’t get that, you’re the President. You’re not like, someone’s crazy uncle who can just-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no. No, no."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"… retweet, whatever."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That was a retweet. And I do a lot of retweets. And frankly, because the media is so fake, and so corrupt, if I didn’t have social media… I don’t call it Twitter, I call it social media. I wouldn’t be able to get the word out. And the word is-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Well, the word is false."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… and you know what the word is? The word is very simple. We’re building our country, stronger and better than it’s ever been before."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Let’s stop-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And that’s what’s happening. And everybody knows it.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Okay, we’ve got a bunch of questions for you."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You know what else the word is? We’re winning in a lot of states.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,We’re winning in a lot of States. You’re going to see that.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Well, let me ask… Okay. I’m glad you brought up the election, because I do want to ask about that. That’s another kind of leftover item. A lot of people have asked you, will you accept a peaceful transfer of power? You have said, repeatedly, “The only way we lose this election is, if it is rigged.” Now, that is simply not true. The fact is, either candidate can lose fair and square, without ballot fraud."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Sure, they can. And do you know what?"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"So, will you accept the results of the election?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Win or lose, that’s the way I want it to be. But when I see thousands of ballots, right? Unsolicited ballots, being given out by the millions, and thousands of them are dumped in dumpsters. And when you see ballots with the name Trump, military ballots, from our great military. And they’re dumped in garbage cans-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"That is a handful… We could go all night, which we won’t."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no, it’s happening every day."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"But, we could go all night, one by one. A single case, a single day. You’re talking about 150 million votes. Your own FBI director says, there is no evidence of widespread fraud."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, really? Well, then he’s not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. 50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no, there’s a tremendous problem."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But let me just tell you, they talk about the peaceful transfer, right? They spied on my campaign and they got caught. And they spied heavily, on my campaign. And they tried to take down a duly elected sitting president. And then, they talk about, “Will you accept a peaceful transfer?” And the answer is, yes, I will. But I want it to be an honest election. And so does everybody else. When I see thousands of ballots dumped in a garbage can, and they happen to have my name on it? I’m not happy about that."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Okay, but just… Those are case, there is no, there is in fact, no evidence of widespread fraud. And you are sowing doubt about our democracy."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Could I ask you, how can you say that?"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Our democracy.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,How can you say that? You do read newspapers?
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,I do.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You do watch the news?
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Yes, I do."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I know you read the news, but do you watch it?"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,I do.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Because, every day, they’re talking about ballots that are corrupt, that are fraudulent."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,And millions that are-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Sure.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,… being processed right now.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Sure, sure. But you can win a race… Take a look at me. You can win a race by 1%."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"So why are you laying the groundwork for that, right now?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’m not, I don’t want that to happen."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"It’s like, if I go play tennis with my husband and I say, ” My ankle is hurting right now.”"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You know what? I don’t want that to happen. Savannah. I want it to be clean.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And I want… I really feel we’re going to win, but I want this to be clean."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Let’s get to questions.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But it’s sort of ironic that you, and them, talk about the peaceful transfer when I spent three and a half years fighting off these maniacs. And now, it turns out, everything’s there. That they were the ones that dealt with Russia, and it’s too bad."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Peaceful transfer, I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Yes. And I think that, your words will probably reassure some folks. Let’s get to our first voter. We’ve got Jacqueline Lugo. Now she is, I told you, this audience is truly split between y’all. You are leaning Biden, she voted for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as an Independent. Jacqueline, what’s your question for the President? And hold the mic up close, and take off your mic, because it’s hard to hear, out here."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Sure.
debate,Jacqueline Lugo,2020,Good evening.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,How are you?
debate,Jacqueline Lugo,2020,Welcome to Miami.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Thank you very much, it’s beautiful."
debate,Jacqueline Lugo,2020,"Mr. President, if you knew COVID-19, as you told Bob Woodward in February-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,As what?
debate,Jacqueline Lugo,2020,"As you told Bob Woodward in February, was airborne and deadlier than the flu, why did you only put in place a travel ban from China, and not put in place other measures mitigating the spread of COVID-19, potentially saving tens of thousands of American lives?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, I did put it in very early, as you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me, and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else, because I put it in. And it turned out that I was 100% right. I also put it on Europe, very early, because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe. And it’s sort of an amazing question. And I appreciate the question, and respect the question, but the news doesn’t get out the right answer."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Because I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. Fauci thought it was necessary. Who I like. Far earlier than the scientists… I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on. And I did it, actually against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi who had no clue what she was doing. And, Biden."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"When I put on the travel ban… You know, I put it on in January. The end of January. When I put on the travel ban Joe Biden, and others, said, “This is ridiculous. You don’t do that.” Well, Dr. Fauci said, I saved thousands and thousands of lives."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Did you [crosstalk 00:25:52]-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I was early, I was extremely early, when I put on the travel ban."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Can I ask you, did your National Security Advisor, on January 28th in the Oval Office, warn you that this would be the greatest national security risk of your administration?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I read that, but no, he didn’t."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"He didn’t say it, or you don’t remember?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I read it… I read it, someplace. Maybe Woodward said it, or something. But no, he did not say that. But, I knew it was a big threat. At the same time, I don’t want to panic this country. I don’t want to go out and say, “Everybody’s going to die. Everybody’s going to-”"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Isn’t there a middle ground?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Okay?
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,You don’t have to mislead-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, there’s not a middle ground."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,… but you can-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no. No. There’s not a middle ground. You have to be safe. You have to be vigilant, and you have to be smart."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,You’re going to like this next couple of voters.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Okay. Good.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"It’s a mom and a daughter. Mom, Barbara voted for you in 2016. She’s leaning to vote for you again. Now, her daughter was too young to vote last time, she’s going to vote for her first time in a presidential campaign. And she is leaning, Biden. So imagine the dinner table at their house. Okay?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,We’ll talk you out of it.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"So Barbara, why don’t you go first, and ask your question."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"[Spanish, foreign language 00:26:48] Miami."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Thank you.
debate,Barbara Peña,2020,"Mr. Trump, as a frontline ER doctor, working through the coronavirus pandemic-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Right.
debate,Barbara Peña,2020,"… I know firsthand, and I’ve seen that many hospitals throughout the United States, are suffering financial hardships. These economic effects are trickling down to the frontline workers."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Right.
debate,Barbara Peña,2020,"We are being… Across the country, frontline workers are being fired, they’re being furloughed. Our salaries are being cut, and this is also happening another economic sectors as well, including the travel industry and hospitality."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Right.
debate,Barbara Peña,2020,"My question to you is, how are you going to get the United States back on track, both in terms of the economy and the pandemic?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So, it’s happening. We just set a record, 11.4 million jobs. We are going to have a phenomenal third quarter, which will be announced on November 1st, just prior to the big November 3rd day, where I think you’re going to see a red wave. But we’re going to have a tremendous announcement. I believe. I mean, we’re going to find out, but GDP is going through the roof. Jobs, real estate, houses. So many things are happening."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So, people were saying, we’re going to have a 42% unemployment. Look, this was a thing that came into our country and it happened a hundred, more than a hundred years ago, and it happened now. They were talking about a 42% unemployment rate."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Who was talking about that?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"It came out, it just came out-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"I heard, 20%."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… at 7.8% unemployment, and people can’t even believe it. Our economy is going to be… Next year, if we don’t have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do, and it kills everything. Our economy is going to be phenomenal, next year. We’re going to have a phenomenal…"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And, I’ll tell you, Savannah. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year, including the state of Florida, where we are now. In Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in Ohio, every place. We had the greatest economy we ever had. We had to close it down, we saved two million lives. We’re opening it up. We have a V-shape and it’s coming back. It’s coming back very fast."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"One other thing, we really helped the hospitals. We’ve sent billions and billions of dollars to the hospitals. In addition, hundreds of millions of masks and gowns. And we went into the ventilator business, because this country was not equipped with ventilators. And I’m not blaming anybody for it. But we’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use. We’re sending them all over the world, because the world needs them. So, they’ve worked very hard and really very, very effectively. Thank you. Great question."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Let’s talk to Isabella, and put the mic close to your mouth. Okay, go ahead."
debate,Isabella Peña,2020,"Mr. President, my parents are, as you heard, both frontline healthcare workers. And I’ve seen the physical and the mental toll that this pandemic has taken on them, firsthand. As well as the exacerbation of coronavirus, due to Americans who are not wearing masks or participating in social distancing. After contracting COVID-19 yourself, has your opinion changed on the importance of mask wearing?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, because I was okay with the masks. I was good with it, but I’ve heard many different stories on masks. I had, being president, you have people, they bring meals, they bring this, they… And I had an instance recently, where a very wonderful person is bringing me a meal, and he’s playing with his mask. And he’s touching his mask, all over the place."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And then he’s bringing a plate in, and I’m saying, “Well, I don’t know if that’s so good.” I mean, the good news, I didn’t eat it. Okay? I decided not to eat it. This was a month ago. But I… Look, look, you have, on the masks, you have two stories. You have a story where they want, a story where they don’t want. I am all for it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Who is, I don’t get that, because it’s just… All of your public health officials, your administration, they’re in unison about this."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Some. No.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,They’re all in unison about it.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, the [crosstalk 00:30:25]."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"The University of Washington, which is, they have a model that your coronavirus task force relies on. Says that, if everyone wore a mask, you could cut expected deaths in half."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And then, you have other people that disagree."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"60,000 lives. Well, what does that mean?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Scott Atkins, if you look at Scott, Dr. Scott. He’s from, great guy, Stanford. He will tell you that, he disagrees with you."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,He’s not an infectious disease expert.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, I don’t know. Look, he’s an expert. He’s one of the great experts of the world."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"But I don’t get it, because you have so much power and influence as president."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’m all for it.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,And you could go to your… You could require it-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,By the way-
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"… at your rallies, and you could say-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I never said, “Don’t wear them.”"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"“Everyone put on a mask right now.” And the University of Washington says, you would save lives."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Savannah, University of Washington. And then, you have other places, say different things. You have a lot of… Hey. Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t wear a mask,” right?"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"At first, but then everybody agreed."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, I don’t know. Then he changed his mind. But then, you have a report coming out two days ago, that 85% of the people wearing masks catch it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"I looked at that report, it’s not about mask wearing. It was neutral on the question of masks."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Savannah. We’re on the same side. I say, wear the mask. I’m fine with it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,Okay. Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I have no problem. We’re on the same side.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Let’s take a break. We’re going to get more questions, right after this."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,(silence).
debate,Savannah,2020,"And we’re back. We’re live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall. Live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall. Thank you again, Mr. President. We have another voter. Now, Christie Alonzo, come on out, Christie, she is leaning slightly towards you, she says. She voted for you in 2016. Christie, you ready? Take the mask off, hold the mic close, and let’s hear your question."
debate,Cristy Montesinos Alonso,2020,"Thank you for your service, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you. Thank you very much.
debate,Cristy Montesinos Alonso,2020,"We’re a hard-working middle-class family of four. My husband and I are both self-employed, and we have to get our own individual healthcare. As you know, healthcare costs have gone up considerably over the decades. And you had originally said you were going to repeal and replace Obamacare. What is your plan now in 2020 to make healthcare costs affordable for Americans like myself?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Good. So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that. That was a big, big thing. And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down. Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better. Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had. The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good. We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming. And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare. So important. And thank you very much."
debate,Savannah,2020,"Mr. President, I got a follow-up pre-existing conditions. This is such a big issue for voters."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It is a big issue for me too.
debate,Savannah,2020,"In point of fact, your administration is about to go to the Supreme Court to argue to throw out the rest of Obamacare, which includes the protections for preexisting conditions."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s right. That’s right.
debate,Savannah,2020,"So your administration is in court right now, trying to get rid of that protection."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"In order to replace it with a much better healthcare at a much lower price. And always, under all circumstances, we are going to protect the Republicans. And maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions. And Savannah, what I want to do, get rid of the terrible Obamacare. I’ve already done it to a large extent because as you know, the individual mandate is gone. That was the worst part."
debate,Savannah,2020,"You repealed, but you haven’t replaced."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no."
debate,Savannah,2020,"Now, you’ve been in office almost four years."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,We have done-
debate,Savannah,2020,"You have both houses of Congress, Senate and House, in Republican hands, and there is not a replacement yet."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That’s right. I’m sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what did we do? We got rid of the individual mandate. That went through the legislature."
debate,Savannah,2020,But the promise was repeal and replace.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Look, look. We should be on the same side. I wanted very simple. I’m going to put it very simple. We would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that’s much less expensive and much better. We will always protect people with preexisting conditions."
debate,Savannah,2020,But if you’re successful in court-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And here’s the thing-
debate,Savannah,2020,"… in November, those preexisting conditions, that promise will be gone."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If we don’t succeed, we are running the remnants of whatever’s left because we took it apart. We are running the remnants of whatever’s left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly, but we’d like to have new healthcare much better and much less expensive."
debate,Savannah,2020,"Let me get to question number five. And you’ll like this, he’s stuck in traffic. His name is Joe White. He is registered as a Democrat. He says he’s leaning toward Biden and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. And his question was a, a second stimulus payment has been broadly agreed upon by the Republicans and Democrats, and yet, now we’re in October and it’s still not passed. Why not use your office to make the second stimulus payment a separate targeted emergency relief package to help Americans weather the pandemic?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%. He should vote for me. The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi. She couldn’t care less about the worker. She couldn’t care less about our people. And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus. The Republicans will approve a stimulus. The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election. The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers. Nancy Pelosi, we are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she’s got to approve it."
debate,Savannah,2020,"People do not love the back and forth of Washington, but this has been a rollercoaster. Back in early October, you one day tweeted, “No more negotiations until after election day. I’m walking away.” Then, I think the next couple of days you said, “Maybe we can do something targeted.”"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s right.
debate,Savannah,2020,"Then you said, “I want a big, big bill.” But then Senate Republicans said, “No, we’re not for that.” So you are the big deal-maker. How come this is so… You yourself had changed positions."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s right. Did you ever hear a word called negotiation when negotiating? Okay. I’m negotiating-
debate,Savannah,2020,But people’s lives are hanging in the balance.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You know what? And you know who I’m negotiating against? Nancy Pelosi, because she doesn’t want to give them money. We should have stimulus. This was not our people’s fault. This was China’s fault. And she’s penalizing our people. I’m ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus. You saw the other day, I said, “Go big or go home.” Right?"
debate,Savannah,2020,That’s what I was talking about.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I want it to be big. I want it to be bold. I want the money to go to directly to the people.
debate,Savannah,2020,"Senate Republicans with you, they’re going to go big?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They’ll go. Yeah, they’ll go. They’ll go. They’re going be very active-"
debate,Savannah,2020,"Okay, because so far, they have not said they would."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I know, because I haven’t asked them to because I can’t get through Nancy Pelosi."
debate,Savannah,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If Nancy Pelosi and I, through my representatives or directly, I don’t care, if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it."
debate,Savannah,2020,"Okay. Our next question comes from… Oh, this is interesting. She voted for Clinton in 2016, but recently changed her registration from Democrat to Independent. She says she’s truly undecided. Her name’s Becky Lightman. Hello, Becky. What’s your question?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,How are you?
debate,Barbara Peña,2020,"Hi, I’m great. How are you?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Nice to see you. Thank you.
debate,Barbara Peña,2020,"Good to see you. So corporate tax rates are a hot button issue and you have cut corporate tax rates. And your opponent, Joe Biden, is planning to raise them. A lot of Americans think that corporations don’t pay their share of taxes and want to see those tax rates increase. What do you say to those Americans to maybe tell them why you want the corporate tax rate lower and why that helps them?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"It’s a great question. We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that number. We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had. That’s what’s going to happen. We have something that’s really good. The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes. Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes. They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest. And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package. So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question. And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin. We can’t let that happen. Thank you."
debate,Savannah,2020,"On the subject of taxes, as you know, the New York times has obtained, it says years of your tax returns among other things, it says that you have debts of approximately $421 million that you have personally guaranteed, and that will come due in the next four years. The question is, on behalf of voters, who do you owe $421 million to?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Okay, first of all, let me answer. What they did is illegal, number one. Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released. And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it. Okay? Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff. When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered. I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared. In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money. $400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco. I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco. 1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings."
debate,Savannah,2020,"Well do I hear you right? It sounds like you’re saying $400 million isn’t that much. But are you confirming that, yes, you do owe some $400 million?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"What I’m saying is that, it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth."
debate,Savannah,2020,That sounds like yes.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things. We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file. Nobody ever looks at that. When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is. No, I don’t owe Russia money. I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages. People have a house, they put a mortgage."
debate,Savannah,2020,Any foreign bank? Any foreign entity?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Not that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money. I want to say two things. Number one, it’s a very small amount of money. Number two, it’s very straight. It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth. Did you ever hear the expression underlevered?"
debate,Savannah,2020,Yeah.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I am extremely underlevered.
debate,Savannah,2020,"Well, here’s the thing. You could clear this up tonight by just releasing your tax returns yourself. That’s what I don’t understand. I think people are just wondering, you’re the only-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"As you know, I’m under audit. It turned out that I am under audit."
debate,Savannah,2020,"Yes, but the IRS said… You are."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But they actually… Excuse me. No, no."
debate,Savannah,2020,But the IRS says that doesn’t stop you from releasing.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But you accused me of not being under audit previously.
debate,Savannah,2020,I did not.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And so did other people at NBC. And I am under audit.
debate,Savannah,2020,You are.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So that one’s solved. That’s good. I am under audit. No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS. And I’ll go a step further. I’m treated very badly by the IRS. They treat me very, very badly. You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit. It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit. They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything. You saw what they did with the tea party people. You saw what they did with the religious group."
debate,Savannah,2020,"But to be clear, there is no law or rule that prohibits you from releasing your tax returns."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive. It talks about all of the properties. They have them listed. You can never learn more, but you know what happened? People went there. All the reporters went. There was a feeding frenzy. This was originally, when I filed it. And I filed it every year. I update it every year. My son is here. They run the company. I don’t run the company."
debate,Savannah,2020,It also says that you’ve paid $750 in taxes in the year you were elected. Is that true or not?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Yeah, because that’s a statutory number. It’s a statutory."
debate,Savannah,2020,But is that true?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I think it’s a filing number. You pay 750, it’s a filing or a filing fee."
debate,Savannah,2020,But is that all you paid? Because most people here probably paid more.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, I don’t know. I can tell you this. If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail. It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else. I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people. This has been going on for years now. Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me. It’s a whole hoax. So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located. When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It’s extremely underlevered. And it’s levered with normal banks. Not a big deal."
debate,Savannah,2020,"All right, let’s take a break. We’ll get more voter questions right after this."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you. Thank you.
debate,Savannah,2020,"We are live in Miami, in the middle of a town hall with President Trump. Thank you again-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,We are live in Miami in the middle of a town hall with President Trump. Thank you again for being here.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"We’ve got another voter, Adam Schucher. He voted for Clinton in 2016. He’s registered as a Democrat and says he’s supporting Biden. Adam, take it away."
debate,Adam Schucher,2020,"Thank you, Savannah. Thank you, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Thank you, Adam."
debate,Adam Schucher,2020,"Four years ago, Senate leadership said it was inappropriate to push through a nominee in an election year, yet they fast-tracked your nominee for the Supreme Court just today. The question I have for you is, what do you say to the voter that thinks it’s hypocritical to act in that manner and that they can’t trust Republicans’ word?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years. And Justice Ginsburg said it best. I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years. So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg. But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding. She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it. But again, plenty of time."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"There’s plenty of time. We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election. But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party. And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that. This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term. And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%. So there’s been 29 times when this has happened. All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"To the voter’s point, I’ll just say that in 2016, you were on another show, actually another morning show, and you were asked whether President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland. And you said, “I think the Senate should wait until the next president, and let the president pick.” Now that was eight months before the election. This is three weeks before the election."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So I have a lot of respect, by the way, for-"
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,So you have changed your position on this?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland. I want to tell you that. But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh. I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else. I have never seen anything like it. And you know what the truth is, Savannah? Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot. There has never been anybody treated so badly as, now Justice Kavanaugh."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,You’ve mentioned that you would like to see Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to the Supreme Court in case any challenges come up in connection with the election. Do you expect her to rule for you?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, I think she’ll have to make that decision. I don’t think she has any conflict at all. A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision. They actually have additional power to make that decision. It would be totally up to her. I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever. We have an election coming up. I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country. If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court. But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other. I would think so."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,But for you? You think she would rule for you?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I have no idea.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Of course she’ll rule one way or the other, but-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Because believe it or not, I never asked her about it. I never talked about it. I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about. And I think a lot of people in my position might. But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk. So I talked to her about life. I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this? Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden. The answer was, “Yes.” She’s unbelievably well-qualified, but I never spoke to her about these various questions."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Let’s get our next voter. She’s leaning to you, Mr. President. She voted for you in 2016. She is a registered Republican. Her name is Moriah Greene. Mariah, what’s your question?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you very much.
debate,Moriah Geene,2020,"Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President. I’m honored to be with you here tonight, sir. So thank you. I’m a pro-life millennial. And my question for you today is, if Roe v. Wade is ultimately overturned in the future, what protections would be put in place or kept for where the mother’s life is in jeopardy in relation to high risk pregnancies?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, again, I’m not ruling on this. And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody. Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade. I never spoke to them about election laws. I never spoke to them about anything. And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint. I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing. I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide. I also think perhaps nothing will happen. I have not talked to her about it. I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it. And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"But what is your preference? Because agreed, that’s not something you should talk to the judge about. But would you like to see Roe versus Wade overturned?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision. And that’s why I chose her. I think that she’s going to make a great decision. I did not tell her what decision to make. And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her. I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law. And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,You’re running as a pro-life Republican. Most pro-life Republicans would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned and abortion banned.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Many of them would. Perhaps most of them would. I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now. I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it. I’ve done the right thing in so doing. How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps. Or you might not find out. It may never get there. It may never get there. We’ll see what happens."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"All right. We have another question. This is Cindy Velez. She is undecided. She says she’s leaning to Biden, and she did vote for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as a Democrat. Hi Cindy. What’s your question?"
debate,Cindy Velez,2020,"Good evening, Savannah."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Hi, Cindy. Thank you."
debate,Cindy Velez,2020,"Good evening, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you very much.
debate,Cindy Velez,2020,"As the mother of a young male of color, I have reason to respect authority, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also out of fear that he may face profiling or be considered a criminal. As an educator, I’ve also had similar conversations with my high school students. Mr. President, what will you and your administration do to better prepare our law enforcement officers to work in collaboration with the communities that they serve and also to protect the lives of innocent Black and Latinos from police brutality and injustice?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Right. I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer. And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch. We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina. He came up with a bill that should have been approved. It was great. It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement. And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it. They wouldn’t go for it at all. And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill. But I do have to say this. And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree. I have done more for the African American community than any president. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln. Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities. I got them funded."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They were on a year to year basis. They could have been put out of business. As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing. And more than they even asked for. I became very friendly with a lot of the heads. But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones. But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it. They never even tried. But I say that, and I say it often. I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it. And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community. I’m very proud of it."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Let’s go to our next question. We have Paulette Dale, she leans slightly to Biden. She voted for Clinton in 2016. She’s registered as a Republican. Paulette, what’s your question?"
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,"Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you. Thank you very much.
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,"I have to say, you have a great smile."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Got you. Thank you.
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,"He does. You’re so handsome when you smile. As the daughter of immigrants to the United States who fled Eastern Europe due to religious persecution, the United States immigration policies are very personal for me."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Right.
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,"Surveys show that most Americans, and the majority of Republicans, support the Dreamers program. So my question for you, Mr. President, is if you are elected to a second term, do you expect to pursue your previous efforts to cut the DACA program?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yeah.
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,Why or why not?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers. You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room. Where do you come from, by the way, originally? Where?"
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,My grandparents were from Russia and Poland.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That’s very good. Okay. So we are going to take care of DACA. We’re going to take care of Dreamer. It’s working right now. We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law. We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border. Mexico is working very closely with us. We have the strongest border we’ve ever had. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally. But we are working very hard on the DACA program. And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year."
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,Thank you.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because I feel the same way as you do about it.
debate,Paulette Dale,2020,"Thank you, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you. Thank you very much.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Mr. President, in point of fact, the DACA program… Under your administration, no new applicants are allowed. And in fact, the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years. So in fact, the DACA program has been curtailed by your administration."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know. And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime. But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way. But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally. And people are very, very happy with it. You haven’t heard any complaints about that. But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"You have been promising this immigration bill since, well, at least July, when you told my colleague on Telemundo it was coming. But nothing’s come yet."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"It’s very happy. The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster. You catch somebody. They could be a murderer. That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country. These are the laws that I inherited. We ended that program. Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good. The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country. And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Sir, we have about 30 seconds left."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Sure.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"I think about people sitting out there tonight. There are some who love you. Some of them are sitting right around here, and some who will never vote for you. But there are people in the middle. There are people who aren’t sure."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s right.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,There are people who want to know why they should give you a second chance and how you might improve in a second term. 30 seconds. What would you say to them?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Because I’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy in the world. We closed it up. We are coming around the corner. The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong. We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve rebuilt our borders. We had no borders. We had no nothing. We’ve rebuilt so much. We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country. Greatest regulation cut, equally as important. And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible. And next year is going to be better than ever before."
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"I got to leave it there. I got a wrap from the control room. Mr. President, thank you for your time."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Thank you very much.
debate,Savannah Guthrie,2020,"Thank you for listening to the voters’ questions. That concludes our town hall. We do want to thank the president again, as well as our audience in hot Miami, and all of you watching at home. And a reminder, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are scheduled to meet in person a week from tonight in Nashville, a second and final presidential debate, moderated by our own Kristen Welker. Have a good evening, and thanks for being with us."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Thank you so much for being here. It is such an honor for me to moderate this debate tonight, the final debate. I want to welcome the first family and the first lady. We’re so glad and thankful that you are feeling better. I want to welcome the Biden family, Dr. Jill Biden. Thank you all for being here tonight. We are so excited. We’re looking forward to a really robust discussion. And the only thing I would reiterate are the CPD guidelines that when the candidates are talking, please hold any applause or any other reactions. Except of course, when they walk out, make sure you cheer and loud and applause so that everyone can hear you. Thank you for having me. This is really the honor of a lifetime. I am going to sit down and just get organized and get settled and the show will start very soon. Thank you for being here. (silence). Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I’m Kristen Welker of NBC News. And I welcome you to the final 2020 presidential debate between President Donald J. Trump and former vice president Joe Biden. Tonight’s debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It is conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Commission’s health security advisor. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions, except right now, as we welcome to the stage, former vice president Joe Biden and President Donald J. Trump."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,How are you doing? How are you?
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"And I do want to say a very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The Debate Commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer. And the Commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on. But on behalf of the voters, I’m going to ask you to please speak one at a time."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you’re ready, let’s start. And we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific. How would you lead the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,… during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis. Two minutes uninterrupted.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So as you know, 2.2 million people modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It’s a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country. And we’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida and it’s now gone."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"There was a very big spike in Texas. It’s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona. It’s now gone. And there was some spikes and surges and other places, they will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that’s coming. It’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks. And it’s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I can tell you from personal experience, I was in the hospital. I had it and I got better. And I will tell you that I had something that they gave me, a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure, but I was in for a short period of time. And I got better very fast or I wouldn’t be here tonight. And now they say I’m immune. Whether it’s four months or a lifetime, nobody’s been able to say that, but I’m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that’s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we’ve been able to do. If you take a look at what we’ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular ventilators we’re now making ventilators all over the world, thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world. It will go away. And as I say, we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay. Former Vice President Biden to you. How would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"220,000 Americans dead. You hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who is responsible for not taking control. In fact, not saying I take no responsibility initially. Anyone is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America. We’re in a situation where there are a thousand deaths a day now. A thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what’s going on in Europe as the New England Medical Journal said, they’re starting from a very low rate. We’re starting from a very high rate."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The expectation is we’ll have another 200,000 Americans dead between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks, the president’s own advisors have told him, we can save a 100,000 lives. And we’re in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan, no comprehensive plan."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time. I would make sure we move into the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe and give them the wherewithal, the financial resources to be able to do that."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We’re in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal, one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world said for the first time ever that the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this. I will end this. I will make sure we have a plan."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, I’d like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic, I assume you’re referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, it’s not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Can you tell us which companies?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Johnson & Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others. Then we also have others that we’re working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me follow up with you and because this is new information. You have set a vaccine is coming soon within weeks now. Your own officials say, “It could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated.” And even then they say, “The country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022.” Is your timeline realistic?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don’t know that they’re counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular that’s the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him. He’s ready to go. As soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a 100 million vials. As soon as we have the vaccine, he’s ready to go."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, your reaction. And just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Make sure it’s totally transparent. Have the scientists of the world see it, know it, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you, “This is going to end by Easter” last time. This is the same fellow who told you that, “Don’t worry, we’re going to end this by the summer.” We’re about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter and he has no clear plan. And there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, your reaction. He says, you have no plan."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t think we’re going to have a dark winter at all. We’re opening up our country. We’ve learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn’t at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January. Months later, he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. Now he’s saying, “Oh, I should have moved quicker,” but he didn’t move quicker. He was months behind me, many months behind me."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal, but it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him, who, as you know, was his chief of staff said, “It was catastrophic. It was horrible. We didn’t know what we were doing.” Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Also, everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make, that’s what we’ve done. We’ve done all of it. But he was way behind us."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, your response."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My response is he is xenophobic, but not because he shutdown access from China. And he did it late after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there in China trying to get the Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the president say in January? He said, ” No.” He said, “He’s being transparent. The president of China is being transparent. We owe him a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And then what happened was we started talking about using the Defense Act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this. He had nothing, he did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about, “Oh, don’t worry. It’s all going to be over soon.” Come on. There’s not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, your reaction?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I didn’t say over soon. I say we’re learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can’t lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know. He’s obviously made a lot of money someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way I as the president couldn’t do that. I’d love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can’t do that."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And Kirsten, every meeting I had, every meeting I had and I’d meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families. Every meeting I had and I had to meet them, I had to. It would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, “This is dangerous and you catch it.” And I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot. Great doctors, great hospitals. And now I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can’t close up our nation. We have to open our school and we can’t close up our nation, or you’re not going to have a nation."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"And, of course, the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy though."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Can I respond to that?
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"30 seconds, please. Then I have a question."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Number one, he says that we’re learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch, there out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it. Come on. We’re dying with it, because he’s never said. See, you said, “It’s dangerous.” When’s the last time? Is it really dangerous still? Are we dangerous. You tell the people it’s dangerous now. What should they do about the danger? And you say, “I take no responsibility.”"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me talk about your Tuesday-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me. I take full responsibility. It’s not my fault that it came here. It’s China’s fault. And you know what? It’s not Joe’s fault that it came here either. It’s China’s fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China for the most part, but they didn’t keep it from coming out to the world, including Europe and ourselves."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Vice President Biden.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The fact is that when we knew it was coming, when it hit, what happened? What did the President say? He said, “Don’t worry. It’s going to go away. It’ll be gone by Easter. Don’t worry. Warm weather. Don’t worry. Maybe inject bleach.” He said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President has said, even today, he thinks we are in control. We’re about to lose 200,000 more people."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,President Trump.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that, but just to finish this, when I closed he said I shouldn’t have closed. And that went on for months. Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown, in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, “This is a terrible thing, you xenophobic.” I think he called me racist even, because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. Joe, it doesn’t."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I didn’t say either of those things.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You certainly did. You certainly did.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn’t about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"He thought I shouldn’t have closed the border, that’s obvious."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Do you want to respond to that quickly, Vice President Biden?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,No.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. Let’s talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger, depression, domestic, and substance abuse outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"What I would say is, I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part, why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living, and why they’re concerned. Those other concerns are real. That’s why he should have been, instead of in a sand trap at his golf course, he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,But you haven’t ruled out more shut downs?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Oh, well, no. I’m not shutting down today, but there are … Look, you need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that’s above a certain level, everybody says, “Slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control.” But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example, schools. Schools, they need a lot of money to be open. They need to deal with ventilation systems. They need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he’s refused to support that money, or at least up to now."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let’s talk about schools, President Trump-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I think we have to respond, if I might."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Please. And then I have a follow-up.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shut downs. But forget about him. His Democrat Governors, Cuomo in New York, you look at what’s going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all, they’re shut down so tight and they’re dying. They’re dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shut downs. No, we’re not going to shut down. And we have to open our schools. And it’s like, as an example, I have a young son, he also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor the second time, he was fine. It just went away. Young people, I guess, it’s their immune system."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me follow up with you, President Trump. You’ve demanded schools open in person and insist they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids but also their teachers and family?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small. But I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We’re not going to have a country. You can’t do this. We can’t keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs. They’re committing suicide. There’s depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. There’s abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. I’ve said it often, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that’s what’s happening. And he wants to close down. He’ll close down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, your response."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Simply not true. We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but they need resources to open? You need to be able to, for example, if you’re going to open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether the person is in fact infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this. And that is not inconsistent with saying that we’re going to make sure that we’re going to open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there, not that many of you are going to die, so don’t worry about it. So don’t worry about it. Come on."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"By the way, I will say this, If you go and look at what’s happened to New York, it’s a ghost town. It’s a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass, these are restaurants that had dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it’s not the answer. I mean, you’re going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic. These are businesses that are dying, Joe. You can’t do that to people. You just can’t. Take a look at New York and what’s happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It’s dying. Everyone’s leaving New York."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Vice President Biden.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Take a look at what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don’t look at this in terms of the way he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states, they’re the states in the Midwest, they’re the states in the upper Midwest. That’s where the spike is occurring significantly. But they’re all Americans. They’re all Americans. And what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one. Make sure we get the help that the businesses need. That money’s already been passed to do that. It’s been out there since the beginning of the summer, and nothing’s happened."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Kristen, New York has lost more than 40,000 people, 11,000 people in nursing homes."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, what about-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"When you say spike, take a look at what’s happening in Pennsylvania where they’ve had it closed. Take a look at what’s happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband’s the only one allowed to do anything. It’s been like a prison. Now, it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina, they’re having spikes and they’ve been closed, and they’re getting killed financially. We can’t let that happen, Joe. You can’t let that happen. We have to open up. And we understand the disease. We have to protect our seniors. We have to protect our elderly. We have to protect especially our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems. And we will protect. We have the best testing in the world by far. That’s why we have so many cases."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week, you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s best known infectious disease expert “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you’re not listening to them, who are you listening to?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’m listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… think to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony, but he did say, “Don’t wear masks.” He did say, as you know, “This is not going to be a problem.” I think he’s a Democrat, but that’s okay. He said, “This is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.” When Joe says that I said, Anthony Fauci said, and others, and many others. And I’m not knocking him, nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was. Nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We’ve learned a lot. But Anthony said “Don’t wear masks,” now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words. “This is no problem. This is going to go away soon.” So he’s allowed to make mistakes. He happens to be a good person."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, your response quickly, and then we’re going to move on to the next section."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My response is that think about what the President knew in January and didn’t tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse, much worse, than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us. He didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic. He didn’t want us… Americans don’t panic. He panicked. But guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day, that in fact his folks went to Wall Street and said, “This is a really dangerous thing.” And a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — said, “Sell short, because we’ve got to get moving. It’s a dangerous problem.”"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, this is what I-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we’re going to move on.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,[crosstalk 00:28:34] I don’t know. Somebody went through Wall Street. You’re the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don’t take it.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I haven’t-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Joe, you have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money deals are made, Joe. I could raise so much more money. As President, and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America. I would blow away every record. But I don’t want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn’t be bringing up Wall Street, because you’re the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn’t believe. We don’t need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to [crosstalk 00:29:15]"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, gentlemen, we’re going to move on."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Don’t tell me about [crosstalk 00:29:17].
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Average contribution, $43."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right. We’re going to move on to our next section, which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained US voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President. What would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I made it clear and I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay a price. And it’s been overwhelmingly clear this election — I won’t even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved, China’s been involved to some degree, and now we learn that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I’m elected. They’re interfering with American sovereignty. That’s what’s going on right now. They’re interfering with American sovereignty."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And to the best of my knowledge, I don’t think the President has said anything to Putin about it. I don’t think he’s talking to them a lot. I don’t think he’s said a word. I don’t know why he hasn’t said a word to Putin about it, and I don’t know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own National Security Advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy… Well, I shouldn’t… Well, I will. His buddy Rudy Giuliani. He’s being used as a Russian pawn. He’s being fed information that is Russian that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything that’s going on here, about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States, because they know I know them, and they know me."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I don’t understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he’s actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he’s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don’t know why he doesn’t do it, but it’s worth asking the question. Why isn’t that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price, because they’re affecting our sovereignty."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, same question to you. [crosstalk 00:31:48] Let me ask the question. You’re going to have two minutes to respond. For two elections in a row now, there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got $3.5 million from Russia and it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. And you got $3.5 million. Your family got $3.5 million. And someday you’re going to have to explain, why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don’t get money from Russia."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Now, about your thing last night. I knew all about that. And through John — who is John Ratcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI — he said the one thing that’s common to both of them."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to Russia between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia, between the sanctions, between all of what I’ve done with NATO. I’ve got the NATO countries to put up an extra $130 billion going to $420 billion a year. That’s to guard against Russia. I sold, while he was selling pillows and sheets, I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And I’ll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the submarine port, you remember that very well, during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it’s even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice-President Biden, you may respond-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,[crosstalk 00:01:31].
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,… and then I do want to follow up on the election security.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learned that this president paid 50 times the tax in China as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country, whatsoever, ever, number one."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Number two, this is a president… I have released all of my tax returns, 22 years, go look at them, 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia’s paying you a lot. China’s paying you a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China’s building a new road to a new golf course you have overseas. So, what’s going on here? Release your tax return or stop talking about corruption."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, your response."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"First of all, I called my accountants, underwrote it, I’m going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it. And it’ll show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, “What did I pay?” They said, “Sir, you prepaid tens of millions of dollars.” I prepaid my tax, over the last number of years, tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think it’s an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that. Nobody told you that."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Did your accountant tell you [crosstalk 00:03:11]?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me. And it wasn’t written. Whenever they write this, they keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee, but let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Number two, I don’t make money from China. You do. I don’t make money from Ukraine. You do. I don’t make money from Russia. You made $3.5 million, Joe, and your son gave you, they even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You’re the big man, I think. I don’t know, maybe you’re not, but you’re the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big men. Joe, what’s that all about? It’s terrible."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, gentlemen. I want to ask you both some questions about all of this, but…"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I have to respond to that.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"I’m going to let you both respond very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes, did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you’re going to release them to the American people?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"As soon as the auditors finish. I get treated worse than the tea party got treated, because I have a lot of people in there-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,[crosstalk 00:04:06].
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled until I decide to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we’re completed with the deal, I want to release it, but I have paid millions and millions of dollars and it’s worse than paying. I paid in advance. It’s called prepaying your taxes. I paid [crosstalk 00:04:32]."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly. Respond very quickly, and then I’ll get to my question."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Why did he… he’s been saying this for four years, show us, just show us, stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Everybody knows.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Nobody knows, Mr. President. What they do know is you’re not paying your taxes, or you’re paying taxes that are so low, when last time he said, what he paid, he said, I only pay that little because I’m smart. I know how to game the system. Come on. Come on, folks."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,So…
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"[crosstalk 00:05:11] President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you on this."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Sure.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied of my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this, Mueller and 18 angry Democrats and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent $1 million on you, Joe, I could find plenty wrong because the kind of things-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… that you’ve done and the kind of monies that your family has taken, I mean, your brother made money in Iraq-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me…
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it’s all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well, you have houses all over the place. You live very well."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, gentlemen. Let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice-President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China and for a Ukrainian energy company when you were vice-president, in retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Nothing was unethical. Here’s what the deal. With regard to Ukraine. We had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned of Burisma, a company that somehow, I had done something wrong, yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath, who work for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out U.S. policy, not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single thing, number one."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do and did not do because it never ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about, what are you talking about, China. I have not had… the only guy who made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,President Trump-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,[crosstalk 00:07:25]…
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,… let me ask my question to you [crosstalk 00:07:28]…
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But could I just one thing?
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Very quickly.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"His son didn’t have a job for a long time, was, sadly, no longer in the military service, I won’t get into that, and he didn’t have a job. As soon as he became vice-president, Burisma, not the best reputation in the world, I hear they paid him $183,000 a month, listen to this, $183,000, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right. I’m going to let the vice-president respond to that quickly, and then I need to get to a question to you. Very quickly, Mr. Vice-President."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,No basis for that. Everybody investigated that. No one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you’ve never divested from your business. You’ve personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don’t have any foreign conflicts of interest?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I have many bank accounts and they’re all listed and they’re all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you’re referring to, which is, everybody knows about it, it’s listed, the bank account was in 2013. That’s what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe. And then I decided, because I was going to do… I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it and I decided I’m not going to do it, didn’t like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me. And then, unlike him where he’s vice-president and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the vice-president of the United States and his son, his brother, and his other brother are getting rich. They’re like a vacuum cleaner. They’re sucking up money [crosstalk 00:09:20]."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. President Trump, thank you. We do need to move on."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not true.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"I do want to ask you, Vice-President Biden, about China. Let’s talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay? And please be specific, what would that look like?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit of the China to go up, not down, with China, up, not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to have a partner in China. It’s 51%, we would not do that at all, number one."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Number two, we’re in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi and when I was still vice-president, he said we’re setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea. You can’t fly through them. I said we’re going to fly through them. We just flew B-52, B-1 bombers through it. We’re not going to pay attention. They have to play by the rules. And what’s he do? He embraces guys like the thugs, like in North Korea and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger [inaudible 00:10:36] all of our friends, all of our allies. We make up only… we’re 25%, 25% of the world’s economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, “These are the rules. You play by them, or you’re going to pay the price for not paying by them economically.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"That’s the way I will run it, and that’s what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice-president."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right. Let’s talk about North Korea.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no, no."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let…
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me. No, I have to…"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,… and Vice President.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, let’s talk about North Korea-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me. No, I have to respond to that."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. Very quickly, and then we’re going to move on to North Korea."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China to …
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two. Number one. Number two, there’s a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, on China policy-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s not true.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"… though, what specifically-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, but wait a minute."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"What are you going to do, what specifically are you going to do to make China pay? You’ve said you’re going to make them pay."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,New sanctions?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Tax payer’s money.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s what?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Taxpayer’s money. Didn’t come from China.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no. You know who the taxpayer is? It’s called China."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"China pays 28 billion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know got the money? Our farmers, our great farmers, because they were targeted. You never charged them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel industry."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And now we have a steel industry.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. Vice President Biden, your response, please."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My response is, look, there’s a reason why he’s bringing up all this malarkey. There’s a reason for it. He doesn’t want to talk about the substantive issues. It’s not about his family and my family. It’s about your family, and your family’s hurting badly. If you’re a middle-class family, you’re getting hurt badly right now. You’re sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, “Well, we can’t get new tires. They’re bald, because we have to wait another month or so.” Or, “Are we going to be able to pay the mortgage?” Or, “Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to community college?” They’re the decisions you’re making, and the middle-class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, they’re in trouble. We should be talking about your families, but that’s the last thing he wants to talk about."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That is a typical statement.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I want to talk about North Korea.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me. Just for one second, please."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"10 seconds, Mr. President. 10 seconds."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That’s a typical political statement. Let’s get off this China thing, and then he looks, “The family around the table, everything.” Just a typical politician when I see that. I’m not a typical politician."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let’s talk about North Korea now.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That’s why I got elected. Let’s get off the subject of China. Let’s talk about sitting around the table. Come on, Joe. You could do better."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"We’re going to talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you’ve met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un three times. You’ve talked about your beautiful letters with him. You’ve touted the fact that there hasn’t been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship you forged."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,No.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Just 30 seconds here because we need to get onto the next topic.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning, had a great conversation. Was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said, “The biggest problem we have is North Korea.” He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him. Different kind of a guy, but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there’s no war. And about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, “Oh, there’s going to be trouble.” I said, “No, they’re not, because he’s not going to do that.” And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people, Seoul is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people. Millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war and I have a good relationship."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, that’s 30 seconds. Vice President Biden to you. North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to reign in this persistent threatening?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because I’d make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because I made it clear as a spokesperson for the illustration when I went to China that I said, “Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces here? Why are you continue to do military maneuvers with South Korea?” I said, “Because North Korea is a problem, and we’re going to continue to do it so we can control them. We’re going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it’s going to continue.” What has he done? He’s legitimized North Korea. He’s talked about his good buddy, who’s a thug, a thug. And he talks about how we’re better off. And they have much more capable missiles, able to reach us territory much more easily than they ever did before."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden. You’ve said you wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong-un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right. Let’s move on to American families.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Kristen.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Very quickly, 10 seconds, President Trump."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,They tried to meet with him. He wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond to that before we move on."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I know for a fact. They tried. We wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what? North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. People don’t understand. Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, we have to move on, because we have a lot of questions to get to. Your response."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We had a good relationship with Hitler before he, in fact, invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said, “We’re going to talk about denuclearization. We’re not going to legitimize you and we’re going to continue to push stronger and stronger sanctions on you.” That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, let’s move on."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And it didn’t happen.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let’s move on and talk about American families.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me. He left me a mess. Kristen.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,President Trump. Okay
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess, and in fact, if you remember the first two or three months. It was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"There was a very day. They left us a mess, and Obama would be, I think, the first to say it, was the single biggest problem he thought that our country [crosstalk 00:17:03]."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay, let’s move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that’s most important to them is healthcare, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice, Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It’s headed to the Supreme Court and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, there’s 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"First of all, I’ve already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, I terminated. It’s gone. Now, it’s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything’s down. Here’s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it’s no good. What we’d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don’t know that it’s going to work. If we don’t win, we will have to run it and we’ll have Obamacare, but it’ll be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare, because without the individual mandate, it’s much different."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better healthcare, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre-existing. So I’d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it, because there’ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we’re going to win the House. You’ll see, but I think we’re going to win the House. But come up with a better healthcare, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And one thing very important, we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare. Far more than we’re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families. Under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won’t even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job at healthcare, and we’re going to do even better. Just you watch."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your healthcare plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"What I’m going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option, and become Bidencare. The public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal, if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That’s what’s going to happen. Secondly, we’re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there’s competition, that doesn’t exist now, by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance, the reason why I had such a fight with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That’s why. Not one single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance unless they chose they wanted to go to something else."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Lastly, we’re going to make sure we’re in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing. There’s no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero. You can’t do it in the ether. He’s been talking about this for a long time. He’s never come up with a plan. I guess we’re going to get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we got the infrastructure plan that we waited for since ’17, ’18, ’19, and 20. I still have a few more minutes. I know you’re getting anxious. The fact is that he’s already cost the American people, because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have it under Obamacare and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions, what are they going to do?"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"I have a follow-up for you Vice President Biden. It relates to something that President Trump said. He’s accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your healthcare plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Concerns that your healthcare plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a healthcare system run entirely by the government. What’s your response to that?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I say it’s ridiculous. It’s like saying that the fact that there’s a public option that people can choose, that makes it a socialist plan. Look, the difference between the president and I… I think healthcare is not a privilege, it’s a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable healthcare, and I am very proud of my plan. It’s gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions, as well as a whole range of other people who, in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that’s going to save people’s lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity to have healthcare for their children. How many of you at home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight, wondering what in God’s name you’re going to do if you get sick, because you’ve lost your health insurance and your company’s gone under? We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that’s what I do."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,President Trump-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me. He was there-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,… your response.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… for 47 years. He didn’t do it. He was now there as vice president for eight years. And it’s not like it was 25 years ago. It was three and three quarters… It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it’s not that he wants it. His vice president, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it. The Democrats want it. You’re going to have socialized medicine, just like you want it with fracking. “We’re not going to have fracking. We’re going to stop fracking. We’re going to stop fracking.” Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets a nomination, where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, “Oh, we’re going to have fracking.” And you never ask that question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you’re handling this, I have to say."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,By the way-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But somebody should ask the question.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,You can ask it.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"He goes for a year, there will be no fracking."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We do have a number-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,There will be no petroleum-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We have a number of topics we’re going to get to.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no. But that’s a big question."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We’re going to get to a number of topics-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I have to respond to healthcare.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President, your response please."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My response is, people deserve to have affordable healthcare, period. Period, period, period. And the Biden care proposal will in fact provide for that affordable healthcare, lower premiums. What we’re going to do is going to cost some money. It’s going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they’re going to have lower premiums. You can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn’t done a thing for anybody on healthcare. Not a thing."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Kristen, when he says-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"When he says public option, he’s talking about socialized medicine and healthcare. When he talks about a public option, he’s talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Wrong.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… and destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. Bernie Sanders tried it in his state.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Bernie.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay. Let’s hear-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It was impossible to work.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let’s let Vice President Biden respond-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It doesn’t work.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He’s a very confused guy. He thinks he’s running against somebody else. He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he’s running against. And the idea that we’re in a situation that is going to destroy Medicare… This is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, “If in fact…” That’s Social Security. “If in fact he continues his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023 with no way to make up for it.” This is the guy who’s tried to cut Medicare. The idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He tried to get rid of-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"10 seconds, Mr. President, and then I have to go to another question."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. Years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. One thing. But this is the guy-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right. Let’s move on. I’m going to move on.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… that when they announced last week-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Mr. President, I have to move on to the next question or else we’re not going to have time to talk about it."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They say the stock market will boom if I’m elected. If he’s elected, the stock market will crash."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay. Let’s move on to the next question.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,The biggest analysts are saying that.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,May I respond?
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Very quickly.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Look, the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what’s happening. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don’t live off of the stock market. Just in the last three years, during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to Wall Street, 700 billion more dollars. 700 billion more dollars. Because that’s his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let’s talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"401(k)s. Kristen, 401(k)s are through the roof."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We’re going to move on.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,People’s stock are through the roof.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And he doesn’t come from Scranton. He lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay. We’re going to move on to the next question.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will show you that.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me move on to my next question, gentlemen."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,They understand.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more Americans have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven’t you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve it. I do.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,But you’re the president.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I do. But I still have to get, unfortunately… That’s one of the reasons I think we’re going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she’d love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing, and able to do something. Don’t forget, we’ve already approved three plans. And it’s gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one, she doesn’t want. It’s near the election. Because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, Mr. Vice President-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, as you know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can’t pass it. He will be able to pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden because-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If we made a deal, the Republicans will pass it."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me ask Vice President Biden a question. You are the leader of the Democratic party. Why have you not pushed the Democrats to get a deal for the American people?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I have, and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. It’s not new. It’s been out there. This HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what’s happening. When I was in charge of the recovery act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budgets and states that have to balance their budgets. And then they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” Come on. What’s the matter with these guys?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrat cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to these guys. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people’s pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And I’d love to do that. I’d love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can’t do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as per your question. But it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right. I want to-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, if I get elected, I’m not going to… I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president. I don’t see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themself in trouble. They’re going to start laying off, whether they’re red or blue, cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers, because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners these days. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I do, because I think one of the things we’re going to have to do is we’re going to have to bail them out too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You got one in six of them going under. They’re not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able… They call it PPP. Money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely, schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help. The businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. These guys will not help them. It’s not giving them any of the money."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"We are going to move on to immigration, but I want to get-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me. One thing very quickly. He said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage. That’s not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,You said very recently-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s very important. We have to help our small businesses.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,You said-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages? What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,You said very recently-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Not true, by the way."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,… you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Say it. Say it.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"What I really like, and I would consider it to an extent-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,In a second administration?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But what I really like… In a second administration. But not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I’ve lived-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Every-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… in different places. I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $ 15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 would be ruinings."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay, President Trump, thank you. Quick response Vice President Biden."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No one should work one job, be below poverty. People are making six, seven, eight bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they’ve allowed us to make it. What’s happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that puts you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We’re going to talk about immigration.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,It’s an [crosstalk 00:32:35]-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"We’re going to talk about immigration now, gentlemen. And we’re going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4,000 kids. You’ve since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels…"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"[inaudible 00:33:00] and lots of bad people, cartels, and they’re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall. You see the numbers. And we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through [crosstalk 00:00:17]-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"But how will you reunite these kids with their families, Mr. President?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. They built cages. They used to say I built the cages, and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper, and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said, “Look at these cages. President Trump built them.” And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Do you have a plan to reunite the kids with their families?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yes. We’re working on it very… We’re trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come out without the parents. They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response, and then another question to you."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,These 500-plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. “Be real tough. We’re really strong.” And guess what? They cannot… Coyotes didn’t bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me ask you a followup question.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Kristen, they did it. We changed the policy. They did it. We changed."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Your response to that?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,We did not separate the [crosstalk 00:34:25]-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They built the cages. Who built the cages, Joe?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Let’s talk about what we’re talking about.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Who built the cages, Joe?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped… Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated, and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents, and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal. It’s criminal."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me ask you about [crosstalk 00:34:50] in 10 seconds and then I need to ask [crosstalk 00:34:53].
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Kristen, I will say this. They went down. We brought reporters, everything. They are so well taken care of. They’re in facilities that were so clean."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,But some of them haven’t been reunited with their families.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They have gotten such good… But just ask one question. Who built the cages? I’d love you to ask him that. Who built the cages, Joe?"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama Administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations, as well as, family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because we made a mistake made. It took too long to get it right. Took too long to get it right. I’ll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is I’ve made it very clear. Within a 100 days, I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all of those so-called dreamers, those DACA kids, they’re going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they’ve gone to they’ve never seen before. I can imagine. You’re five years old. Your parents are taking across the Rio Grande River and it’s illegal. And you say, “Oh, no, Mom. Leave me here. I’m not going to go with you.” They been here. Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, your reaction."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I’ve changed. Without having a specific, we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years he was Vice President. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, your response."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The catch and release, you know what he’s talking about there? If in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested, they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what? They showed up for a hearing. And this is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That’s never happened before in America. That’s never happened before in America. You come to the United States and you make your case that, “I seek asylum based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.” They’re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, your response. 30 seconds. And then we’ll move on."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So important. It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration, of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in. A rapist would come in. A very bad person would come in. We would take their name. We have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, “Come back in two years, three years. We’re going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason. We’re going to give you a court case.” When you say they come back, they don’t come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really… I hate to say this, but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back, but there are very, very few."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay, President Trump. Let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we’re going to move on to the next section."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You don’t know the law, Joe."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, your response."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Know the law, what he’s telling you is simply not true. Check it out."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, check it out. They don’t come back."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Check it out.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right. Let’s move on to the next section.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But we don’t have to worry about it, because they terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it anymore, Joe."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let’s move on to the next section.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s right. And you 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Go ahead.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right. Let’s talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called the talk. It happens regardless of class and income, parents who feel they have no choice, but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I do. I do. My daughter is a social worker and she’s written a lot about this. She has her graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. And one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East Side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90% African-American, was to learn more about what was going on. I never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over, make sure she puts… For a traffic stop. “Put both hands on top of the wheel and don’t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.” But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, “When you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over just, yes, sir, no, sir. Hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you’re a person making 300,000 … child of a $300,000 a year person or someone who’s on food stamps. The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said, we’ve never lived up to it, that we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. Well, guess what, we have never, ever lived up to it. But we’ve always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president to come along and says, that’s the end of that. We’re not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better healthcare, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses, all the things we can do. And I’ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot. It’s about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, same question to you, and let me remind you of the question. I would like you to speak directly to these families, do you understand why these parents fear for their children?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Yes, I do. And again, he’s been in government 47 years, he never did a thing, except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community, and they were called … and he called them superpredators. And he said that, he said it, superpredators. And they never lived that down. 1994, your crime bill, the superpredators. Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I’ve done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn’t do it. I don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might’ve wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had to twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office. They cried in the Oval Office."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Two weeks later, they’re out saying, “Gee, we have to defeat him.” Criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for Opportunity Zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don’t talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made, biggest beneficiary, the black and Hispanic communities. And then Historically Black Colleges and Universities, after three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great. They came into the office and I said, “What are you doing?” After three years, I said, “Why do you keep coming back?” Because we have no funding.” I said, “You don’t have to come back every year.” “We have to come back.”"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Because President Obama would never give them long-term funding and I did. 10 year long-term funding and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, “I think you need more.” And I said, “The only bad part about this is I may never see you again.” Because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved Historically Black Colleges and Universities."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay, and we’re going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My response to that is I never ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile, this is a guy who said, “The problem with the crime bill, there’s not enough people in jail. There’s not enough people in jail.” And go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, “not enough people.” He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, and the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who in the Central Park Five, five innocent black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested. Look and granted, he did in fact, let 20 people … he commuted 20 people’s sentences."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We commuted over 1,000 people’s sentences, over 1,000. The very law he’s talking about is a law that in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we’re in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of those things we should be doing, there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That’s why I’m offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that’s what I’m going to do."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But why didn’t he do it four years ago? Why didn’t you do that four years ago? Even less than that. Why didn’t you when you vice president? You keep talking about all these things you’re going to do, and you’re going to do this, but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,We did-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You know Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would’ve never run. I would’ve never run. I ran because of you. I’m looking at you now, you’re a politician, I ran because of you."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that. And then I do have some questions for both of you."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, I’ll tell you what I hope he does look at me because what’s happening here is, you know who I am. You know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I’m anxious to see this take place. I am … The character of the country is on the ballot. Our character’s on the ballot, look at us closely."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me ask some follow up-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Please respond and then we’re going to have follow up questions.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq. If this is true, then he’s a corrupt politician. So don’t give me the stuff about how you’re this innocent baby. Joe, that calling you a corrupt politician-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Nobody’s calling me-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,They’re calling it the laptop from hell.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We’re talking about the issue-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me, [crosstalk 00:06:13] the laptop from hell."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Nobody.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, we’re talking about race right now. And I do want to stay on the issue of race. President Trump you-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I have to respond to that. Because look-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Please, very quickly."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You got to be kidding me-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s exactly what was told.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Gentlemen, I want to stay on the issue of race."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You have to be kidding, here we go again with the Russia. Boy, oh, boy."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We’re going to continue on the issue of race.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Can’t believe that one.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Mr. President you’ve described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You’ve shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You’ve said that black professional athletes exercising their First Amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting, “Pigs in a blanket,” talking about police, pigs, pigs, talking about our police. “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” I said, “That’s a horrible thing.” And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter, I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,What do you say to Americans who are concerned by that rhetoric [crosstalk 00:00:07:58]?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t know. I mean, I don’t know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and Opportunity Zones-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and Opportunity Zones, I took care of Black colleges and universities, I don’t know what to say, they can say anything, I mean, they can say anything. It’s a very… Makes me sad, because I am the least racist person, I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience, I’m the least racist person in this room."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay. Vice President Biden, let me ask you very quickly and then I have a follow-up question for you."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history, he pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. Started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s getting rid of those Mexican rapists, he’s ban Muslims because they’re Muslims, he has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to… About the Proud Boys, last time we were on stage here he said, “I tell them to stand down and stand ready.” Come on, this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, I’m going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then I have a follow-up question."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, he made a reference to Abraham Lincoln, where did that come in? I mean-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,You said you’re Abraham Lincoln.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… where did that….. No.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,You said-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And I’m saying-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I didn’t say, “I’m Abraham Lincoln,” I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.” Now, you have done nothing other than the Crime Bill, which put-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Oh, God."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not true.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, let me ask Vice President Biden a question."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And you know what? They remember it because if you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly, just take a look at what’s happening out there."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me ask Vice President Biden about… Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context, crime bills that you supported in the ’80s and ’90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession, they are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they are uncles, whose families are still to this day, some of them suffering the consequences. So, speak to those families, why should they vote for you?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"One of the things is that in the ’80s we passed 100 percent, all 100 senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs, it was a mistake. I’ve been trying to change since then particularly the portion on cocaine. That’s why I’ve been arguing that in fact we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense, they should be going into treatment across the board, that’s what we should be spending money. And that’s why I set up drug courts which were never funded by our Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem, they should be going into treatment. That’s what we’ve been trying to do, that’s what I’m going to get done because I think the American people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs, but they were not in the Crime Bill."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,[crosstalk 00:11:04].
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But, why didn’t he get it done? See, it’s all talk, no action with these politicians, why didn’t he get it? “That’s what I’m going to do when I become president.” You were vice president along with Obama as your president, your leader, for eight years, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years to get it done, now you’re saying you’re going to get it done because you’re all talking and no action, Joe."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Your response.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You didn’t get anything done.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We got 38,000 prisoners [ crosstalk 00:11:30]-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You got nothing done.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison, we have… There were over a thousand people who were given clemency. [inaudible 00:03:38]. In fact, were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they’re conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process, we lost an election, that’s why I’m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I just have-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Your response and then we’re going to move on to climate change.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… one question, why didn’t you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn’t you do it? You just said, “I’m going to do that, I’m going to do this.” You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison, now you’re saying you’re going to get… You’re going to undo that, why didn’t you get it done? You had eight years with Obama. You know why, Joe? Because you’re all talk and no action."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,[crosstalk 00:00:12:23].
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, Vice President Biden, and then we’re going to move on to the next section."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We had a Republican Congress, that’s the answer."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, you got to talk them into it, Joe, sometimes you got to talk them into it."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We’re going to move on to our next section which is climate change.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… like I did with criminal justice reform, I had to talk Democrats into it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,You did what we already had done.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we got to get onto climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector, Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So, we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs, I do love the environment, but what I want is that cleanest crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time, not Joe, I haven’t heard Joe use the term because I’m not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do. Look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it’s filthy, the air is filthy. The [Paris Accord 00:00:13:55], I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord, it was so unfair. China doesn’t kick in until 2030, Russia goes back to a low standard, and we kicked in right away, it would have been… It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water, and the best carbon emission standards that we’ve seen in many, many years."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Vice President Biden-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And we haven’t destroyed our industries.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Climate change, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we’re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time, we’re going to pass the point of no return within the next 8 to 10 years. Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up… To limit the emissions, will put us in a position where we’re going to be in real trouble. Here’s where we have a great opportunity. I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as the labor, the people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because what it does, it will create millions of new good paying jobs, we’re going to invest in, for example, 500,000… Excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future. In the meantime, China is doing that. We’re going to be in a position where we’re going to see to it that we’re going to take 4 million existing buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don’t leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of…"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So they don’t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs. By the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it’s going to create millions of jobs and it’s going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That’s what’s happening and what right now, by the way, Wall Street firms indicated that my plan, my plan will in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This is from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does. Not on climate, just on economy."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"President Trump, your response."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They came out and said very strongly $6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, if you look at his plan, his-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,[crosstalk 00:16:56].
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… his environmental plan, do you know developed it? AOC plus three, they know nothing about the climate. I mean, she’s got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate and they’re all hopping through hoops for AOC plus three. Look, their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars. If we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they’re concerned, if you had no window, it would be a lovely thing."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn’t done by smart people. This wasn’t done by anybody. Frankly, I don’t even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend a hundred trillion dollars. That’s their real number. He’s trying to say it was six. It’s a hundred trillion dollars. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little, tiny, small windows and many other things-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And many other things. And many other things.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay, let me have the vice-president respond."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It is crazy.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We’re running out of time and we have a lot more questions to get back to.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You’ll destroy our country.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,So let’s hear from the vice president. I have a number of more question..
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I don’t know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Queens.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"A hundred trillion dollars, give me a break. This plan has been endorsed by every major, every major environmental group and every labor group, labor, because they know the future lies. The future lies in us being able to breathe and they know they’re good jobs and getting us there."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, the fastest growing industry in America is the electric, excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45, 50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner if we go the route I’m proposing."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,President Trump-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Please respond and then I have his follow up.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"We are energy independent for first time. We don’t need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive. Kills all the birds. It’s very intermittent. It’s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China and the fumes coming up, if you’re a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we’re talking about with natural gas, which is very clear."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"One other thing, solar-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Find me a scientist who says that.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I love solar, but solar doesn’t quite have it yet. It’s not powerful yet to really run our big, beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,False.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"It’s all a pipe dream, but you know what we’ll do? We’re going to have the greatest economy in the world, but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry you want. And what about fracking?"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Now we have to ask him about fracking.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Let me allow the Vice President Biden to respond.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I never said I oppose fracking.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You said it on tape.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Show the tape, put it on your website."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’ll put it on.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Would you rule out about banning fracking?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need, we need other industries to transition, to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking, capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money in doing it, but it’s a transition to that."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,I have one more question in this pile then-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Good.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I am against fracking. Until he got the nomination, he went to Pennsylvania. Then he said, “But you know what Pennsylvania?” He’ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Fracking on federal land. I said, no fracking and/or oil on federal land."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas, there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"The families that we’re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they’ve ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we’ve produced for Hispanic, for Black, for Asian, it’s nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely, nine times more."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Now somebody lives, I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you’re saying, but they’re making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it and I saved it again a number of months ago, when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Say what you want to bet relationship. We got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, your response and then we’re going to have a final question for both of you."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My response is that those people live on what they call fence lines. He doesn’t understand this. They live near chemical plants that in fact, pollute, chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware and there are more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom get in the car and when there are first frost to drive me to school, turning the windshield wiper, there’d been oil slick in the window. That’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it’s not a matter of what you’re paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? You impose restrictions on the pollutions that if the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay. I have one final question called.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Would he close down the oil industry?
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,It falls-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Would you close dow the oil industry?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, I have a transition from the old industry, yes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, that’s a big statement."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I will transition. It is a big statement.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s a big statement.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Because I would stop.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Why would you do that?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because the oil industry pollutes, significantly."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, I see. Okay."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Here’s the deal-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s a big statement.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time, and I’d stopped giving to the oil industry, I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won’t get federal subsidies to the gas, oh, excuse me to solar and wind."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yeah.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Why are we giving it to oil industry?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"We actually give it to solar and wind. That’s maybe the biggest statement. In terms of business, that’s the biggest statement."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because basically what he’s saying is-
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"We have one final question, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Okay, Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,Okay.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, is-"
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds to respond-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Ohio.
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,… and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production, by 2050 totally."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,All right. One final question to both of you-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Is he going to get China to do it?
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"No, we’re finished with this-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Is he going to get China to do it?
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,We have to move onto our final question.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No, I’m going to rejoin Paris Accord and make China abide by what they agreed to."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,[Crosstalk 00:24:31].
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right. This is about leadership, gentlemen. And this first question does go to you, President Trump. Imagine this is your inauguration day. What will you say in your address, to Americans who did not vote for you? You’ll each have one minute, starting with you, Mr. Trump."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"We have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we’re rebuilding it and we’re doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time, et cetera. But, I will tell you, go back."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates; number one in the class, everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I’m cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody’s taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a Depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell, and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right. Vice President Biden, same question to you: what will you say during your inaugural address to Americans who did not vote for you?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I will say, I’m an American President. I represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me, and I’m going to make sure that you’re represented. I’m going to give you hope. We’re going to move; we’re going to choose science over fiction. We’re going to choose hope over fear. We’re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We can grow this economy, we can deal with the systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. That’s the fact, that’s what we’re going to do. And I’m going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect. Treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. And I’m going to make sure you get that. You haven’t been getting it the last four years."
debate,Kristen Welker,2020,"All right, I want to thank you both for a very robust hour and a half, a fantastic debate. Really appreciate it. President Trump, Former Vice President Joe Biden. Thank you to Belmont University for hosting us tonight, and most importantly, thank you to those watching tonight. Election day is November 3rd. Don’t forget to vote. Thank you everyone and have a great night."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Thank you.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Good evening. From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first and only vice presidential debate of 2020 sponsored by the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates. I’m Susan Page of USA Today. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight, we have a small and socially distant audience and we’ve taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in this audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they’ve agreed to express that enthusiasm only twice—at the end of the debate and now, when I introduce the candidates. California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence. Senator Harris and Vice President Pence, thank you for being here. We’re meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington, after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery, and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns and the commission on presidential debates agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I’m here to enforce them.On behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note: no one in either campaign or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics I’ll raise or what questions I’ll ask. This 90 minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I’ll begin a segment by posing a question to each of you. Sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we’ll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we’ll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectful exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let’s begin with the ongoing pandemic that has cost our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine States have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn’t do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools and hotspots, a federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond without interruption."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Thank you, Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We’re looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people, who in the last several months, had to file for unemployment. And here’s the thing, on January 28th, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it’s lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people, and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn’t tell you."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Can you imagine if you knew on January 28th, as opposed to March 13th, what they knew, what you might’ve done to prepare? They knew, and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said, “You’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask. You’re on the other side of his ledger if you don’t.” And in spite of all of that, today, they still don’t have a plan. They still don’t have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine, and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on, and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that. And frankly, this administration has forfeited their-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,… right to reelection based on this.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll, as a percentage of our population, is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You had the administration’s coronavirus task force. Why is the US death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond without interruption."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Susan, thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it’s a privilege to be on the stage with you. And our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was, he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical. But I can tell you having led the white house coronavirus task force that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War Two."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"And I believe it saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time, we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests had been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies, so our doctors and nurses had the resources support they needed. And we began, really, before the month of February we started to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that have been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump’s leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe we’ll have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump, and I, and our task force has been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. And I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… of America first. And the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… of the sacrifices they have made. It’s saved countless American lives-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond?"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Absolutely. Whatever the vice president is claiming the administration has done, clearly, it hasn’t worked. When you’re looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss, and the vice president is the head of the task force and knew on January 28th, how serious this was. And then, thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said, when asked, “Well, why didn’t you all tell anybody?” He said, “Because the president wanted people to remain calm.”"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Well, let’s [crosstalk 00:07:53]-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"No. But Susan, this is important. And I want to add-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Susan, I have to weigh in here-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,I have to weigh in.
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,I’m speaking.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"You can have 15 more seconds, and then we’ll give the vice-president a chance to respond-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Thank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you were going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn’t know when they could go back? How calm were you-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you-
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,… when your children-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,… couldn’t see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Let’s give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"There’s not a day gone by that I haven’t thought of every American family that’s lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you’ll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months, hasn’t worked, that’s a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,I’m referring to the president-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"But the reality… If I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the president in the Oval Office, the president told the American. Now President Trump, I will tell you, has boundless confidence in the American people, and he always spoke with confidence that we’d get through this together. But when you say it hasn’t worked… When Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx, and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said, if the president didn’t take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy, that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. That’s the reality."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"They also said to us, if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Vice President Pence-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"One life lost is too many, Susan. But the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors, our nurses, our first responders."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,And I’m going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Vice President Pence, you were in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials. No social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration…"
debate,Susan Page,2020,How can you expect Americans to follow the administration’s safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you at the White House have not been doing so?
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months, that when given the facts, they’re willing to put the health of their families and their neighbors and people they don’t even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey and New York and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done, and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sun Belt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us, and the President introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Yes, thank you. Thank you, Vice President."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"If I may say, that Rose Garden event, been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife, Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for Coronavirus, and it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise. The difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not just mandates with the Coronavirus, but a government takeover of healthcare, the Green New Deal, all government control. We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,Let’s talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Which we’ve always done.
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear, but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that, if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker, knowing you didn’t have enough money saved up, and now you’re standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of a administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let’s talk about caring about the American people. The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Susan, we talked about this."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,It is asking too much of the people. That they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"I’m sorry. Kamala Harris, Senator Harris, I mean, I’m sorry."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"That’s fine, I’m Kamala."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"No, no, you’re Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated. But half of Americans now say they wouldn’t take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine before or after the election, should Americans take it, and would you take it?"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it, absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Vice President Pence, there’ve been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the President’s diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold and that you are seeking. That’s our second topic tonight. It’s the role of the Vice President. One of you will make history on January 20th. You will be the Vice President to the oldest President the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74 years old on inauguration day. Joe Biden will be 78 years old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump’s hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, Susan, thank you. Although, I would like to go back."
debate,Susan Page,2020,I think we need to move on to the issue of vice presidency.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, thank you, but I would like to go back because the reality is that we’re going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time. In unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we’re right now producing tens of millions of doses. So the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine, if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people’s lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year. And it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it’s unacceptable. And let me also say, the reality is, when you talk about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"It was 2009. The Swine flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it ended up not being as lethal as the Coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the Swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the Swine flu. If the Swine flu had been as lethal as the Coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was Vice President, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own chief of staff, Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck that they did, “Everything possible wrong.” And we learned from that. They left the strategic national stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learn from it, and I think the American people, I’m going to say again, can be proud of what we have done. And Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked her Vice President Pence, which is, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Let me tell you first of all, the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable days of my life. I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I’d be sitting here right now, I know, would make her proud. And she must be looking down on this. Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service, and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest department of justice in the United States. Second only to the United States Department of Justice. And there, I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for-profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I’ve been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation in hotspots around the world. I’ve traveled the world, I’ve met with our soldiers in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump unifying our country around our common values and principles."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Neither President Trump, nor Vice President Biden has released a sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump’s doctors have given misleading answers, or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you in turn is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, Susan, thank you. And let me say on behalf of the President and the First Lady, how moved we’ve all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it’s emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the Coronavirus. But the care of the President received at Walter Reed Hospital, the White House doctors was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue. The American people have a right to know about-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… they will continue. The American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their president, and we’ll continue to do that. But I’m just extremely grateful and was more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,Thank you.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"I never expected to be on this stage four years ago, so I know the feeling, but the reality is we’ve got an election before the American people in the midst of this challenging year and the stakes have never been higher, but I think the choice has never been here."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President. I want to give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is, do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates and especially about presidents, especially when they’re facing some kind of challenge?"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Absolutely. And that’s why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly by contrast that the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let’s look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said, “You mean $750,000?” And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt, it means you owe money to somebody. And it’d be really good to know who the President of the United States, the commander-in-chief owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the President’s decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you or self-interest?"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"So, Susan, I’m glad you asked about transparency because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He is honest, he is forthright, but Donald Trump on the other hand has been about covering up everything."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Susan, Susan-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,Thank you.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"The American people have a president who was a businessman, he’s a job creator. Who’s paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He’s created tens of thousands of American jobs. And the President said those public reports are not accurate. And the President’s also released literally stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulations-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… unleashing American energy, fighting for free and fair trade. And all of that’s on the line-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are elected.
debate,Susan Page,2020,That’s a good segue into our third topic-
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,That’s a great segue.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"… which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans, it’s been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to seven point nine percent in September, but the job growth had stalled. And that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney, and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking for work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year haven’t been replaced. Those hardest hit include Latinos, Blacks, and women. Senator Harris, the Biden, Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy. And you would pay for that new spending by raising four trillion dollars in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes put the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer uninterrupted."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Thank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn’t be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America’s economy based on the health and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing, which is why he passed a tax bill benefiting the top one percent and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a two trillion dollar deficit that the American people are going to have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill, he’ll get rid of it. And what he’ll do with the money is invest it in the American people."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do, I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don’t think it ever happened, but Joe Biden will do that. He’ll invest in infrastructure. It’s about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe was going to invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development, so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two-year community college, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you’ll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we’ll make sure that if you have student loan debt, it’s cut by $10,000."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy which is, it’s about investing in the people of our country. As opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go off-shore to do their business."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Senator Harris.
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,You’re welcome.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Vice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that’s not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer uninterrupted."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"When President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was when Joe Biden was vice president, they tried to tax and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue collar, hardworking Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump’s tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one, Joe Biden’s going to raise your taxes. It’s really remarkable to think-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,That’s not what I said.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"I mean, right after a time where we’re going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we’ve already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade and secured four trillion dollars from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, save 50 million jobs through the Paycheck Protection Program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a two trillion dollar Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of Amercian jobs all across the heart land. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China, that when took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tarrifs, that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy is on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. And the American economy, the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… and four more years of president Donald Trump, 2021-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… is going to be the biggest economic year in the history of this country.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence, Senator Harris."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Well, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week’s debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth and the truth and the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear, he will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,He said he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts.
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"The important [inaudible] is you said the truth. Joe Biden has said it twice in the debate last week that he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,That is-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Senator, that’s the math."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"That is absolutely not true, [crosstalk 00:00:29:32]."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Is he the only going to repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"If you don’t mind letting me finish, we can then have a conversation, okay?"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Please.
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"Okay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking, he has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who, during the great recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now that Trump-"
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"… for the Recovery Act that brought America back, and now the Trump-Pence administration wants to take credit when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden’s success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course, now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand did that. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"On the one hand, you have Joe Biden who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought healthcare to over 20 million Americans and protected people with preexisting conditions. And what it also did is it saved those families who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who is in court right now, trying to get rid of-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Susan, please [crosstalk 00:30:54]"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"… trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections if you have preexisting conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan. [crosstalk 00:31:03]"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Yes, but we need to give Vice President Pence his time."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"He interrupted me, and I’d like to just finish, please. If you have a preexisting condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they’re coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition [crosstalk 00:01:21], they’re coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents’ coverage, they’re coming for you."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Senator Harris, thank you."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,You’re welcome.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Let me give you a chance to respond.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well. I hope we have a chance to talk about healthcare because Obamacare was a disaster, and the American people remember it well. And President Trump and I have a plan to improve healthcare and protect preexisting conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your own opinion, but you’re not entitled to your own facts. You yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president, that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked at a supporter in the eye and pointed and said, “I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels.”"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"They have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper, USA Today, said really wasn’t that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing, the V-shape recovery that’s underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump [crosstalk 00:32:37]"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you very much Vice President Pence. Once again, you’ve provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I’d like to pose the first question to you. This year, we’ve seen record-setting hurricanes in the South. Another one, Hurricane Delta, is now threatening the Gulf, and we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter, and more deadly and have made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Thank you, Susan. Well, first, I’m very proud of our record on the environment, on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. Our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act. It’s the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing, but the issue is what’s the cause and what do we do about it? President Trump has made it clear that we’re going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They’d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy costs of American families in their homes, and literally would crush American jobs."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"And President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong, free market economy. What’s remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we’ve done it through innovation. And we’ve done it through natural gas and fracking, which Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning of fracking."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"And so by creating the kind of American innovation, we’re actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center. And even Governor Gavin Newsom from your state has agreed, we’ve got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as difficult as they are, there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you [crosstalk 00:35:24]
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… but many of the climate alarmists-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Vice President Pence, I’m sorry, your time is up."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… use hurricanes and wildfires to try and sell the goods of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are going to always put-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… American jobs and American workers first.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Senator Harris, as the vice president mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week’s debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden-Harris campaign website, it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden-Harris administration toward the Green New Deal? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"So, first of all, I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden’s economic plan… Moody’s, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said will create seven million more jobs than Donald Trump’s."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"And part of those jobs that will be created by Joe Biden are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because, you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"And so Joe believes, again, in science. I’ll tell you something, Susan, I served when I first got to the Senate on the committee that’s responsible for the environment. Do you know, this administration took the word science off the website, and then took the phrase climate change off the website? We have seen a pattern with this administration, which is they don’t believe in science. And Joe’s plan is about saying we’re going to deal with it, but we’re also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California, and the question was, the science is telling us this… You know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn’t know."
debate,Kamala Harris,2020,"So let’s talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we’re going to invest that in renewable energy, which is going to be about the creation of millions of jobs. We will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035. Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the Climate Agreement with pride."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Senator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"As I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We’ll follow the science. But once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they’re going to raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week, that on day one, he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first Senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the green new deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out. The Green New Deal is on their campaign website."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"And as USA TODAY said, it’s essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the Senator say that she’s going to resubmit America to the Paris climate accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment and will continue to cherish it. We’ve made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We don’t need a massive $2 trillion Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Joe Biden wants us to retrofit-
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Four million business-
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump-
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,He’s going to put America first. He’s going to put jobs first and we’re going to take care of our environment and follow the science.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President-
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Well, on the issue of jobs."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Senator Harris.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Let’s talk about that. The vice-president earlier referred to it as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment. The president’s trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession because of it. And when we look at where this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration and the American people know what I’m talking about."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"I think about 20 year olds, we have a 20 something year old who are coming out of high school and college right now. And you’re wondering, is there going to be a job there for me? We’re looking at people who are trying to figure out how they’re going to pay rent by the end of the month, almost half of American renters are worried about whether they’re going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now. And it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, I’d love to respond. Look, lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China over the last several decades. And again, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your opinion. You’re not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice-president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. And president Obama said they were never coming back. He said, we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years after we cut taxes-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Roll back regulation, unleashed American energy. This administration saw 500,000 manufacturing-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Jobs created, and that’s exactly the kind of growth we’re going to continue to see as we bring our nation through-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,This pandemic.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Listen-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,A Green New Deal-
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"You’re passing new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord. It’s going to kill jobs this time, just like it killed jobs-"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,I just need to respond very quickly.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,15 seconds.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Thank you-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,And then we move on.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America’s auto industry and you voted against it. So let’s set the record straight. Thank you.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"I’d like to talk about China. We have as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change in North Korea and in a video tonight, President Trump again, blamed it for the Coronavirus saying China will pay. Vice President Pence, how would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Thank you, Susan. Well, before I leave that, let me speak to voting records if I can. Everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go South of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA. In the United States, Mexico and Canada the agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But Senator you said it didn’t go far enough on climate change, you put your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and a head of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that it’s probably why Newsweek magazine said that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"So now with regard to China, Susan first and foremost, China is to blame for the coronavirus and President Trump is not happy about it. He’s made that very clear, made it clear again today that China and the world health organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the Coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump in dealing with China from the outset of this administration, standing up to China that had been taking advantage of America for decades in the wake of Joe Biden’s cheerleading for China. President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know Joe Biden opposed President Trump’s decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical. He said it was-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,The President Trump has stood up-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Vice President Pence, your time is up."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,To China. We’re going to continue to stand strong.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"We want to improve the relationship, but we’re going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Vice President Pence.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,for what they did to America with the coronavirus.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you. Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked the vice-president. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You’ll have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Susan, the Trump administration’s perspective and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs, and America’s standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created within the White House and office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got rid of it."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Not true.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let’s look at the job situation. We mentioned before, the trade deal, the trade war, they wanted to call it with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs and a manufacturing recession and the American consumer paid thousands of dollars, more for goods because of that failed war that they called it. Then let’s talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping the head of the Chinese communist party than they do Donald Trump. The President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today because of a failure of leadership by this administration."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Senator Harris, we’ve seen changes in the role of the United States in terms of global leadership over the past four years. And of course times do change. What’s your definition? We’ve seen strains with China, of course, as the vice president mentioned, we’ve seen strange with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"So I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues and Joe, I think he said it quite well. He says, “Foreign policy, it might sound complicated, but really it’s relationships.” Just think about it as relationships. So we know this in our personal and professional relationships, you got to keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who’ve stood with, you got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Let’s take for example, Russia. So I serve on the intelligence committee of the United States Senate. America’s Intelligence Community told us Russia interfered in the election of the president of the United States in 2016 and his plan in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American Intelligence Community. You look at our friends at NATO, he has walked away from agreements."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"You can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal guys. We were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country. And because of Donald Trump’s unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan it’s about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation in addition to our great military has been that we keep our word, but Donald Trump doesn’t understand that because he doesn’t understand what it means to be honest."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,He doesn’t understand what it means to be honest.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you a chance to respond."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and they never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we’ve been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before thanks to President Trump’s leadership. We’ve strengthened our alliances across the Asia Pacific, and we’ve stood strong against those who would do us harm. When President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the middle East, the size of Pennsylvania, but President Trump unleashed the American military and our armed forces destroy the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader, al-Baghdadi without one American casualty. Al-Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands, but notably America’s hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller. Her parents, which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller’s murder were brought to justice in the United States."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield along with the other beetle. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the oval office, presented a plan, they said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused or mercilessly before they killed her, but when Joe Biden was Vice President they hesitated for a month, and when armed forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier. And her family says with a heart that broke the heart of every American, that if president Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"So, if we destroy the ISIS caliphate and you talk about re-entering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,President Donald Trump got us out of the deal-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… And when Qassem Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… To do harm to Americans, President Donald Trump took him out-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… And America is safer, our allies are safer and the American people know president Donald Trump will never take action [crosstalk 00:00:16:40]."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length, because of course there are other topics we want to talk about."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,But I would like equal time.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Yes.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Thank you.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Please go ahead.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"First of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter’s case, and I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. What happened to her is awful and it should have never happened, and I know Joe feels the same way, and I know that president Obama feels the same way, but you mentioned Soleimani. Let’s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq, and they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump’s where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington cemetery and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, “What’s in it for them?” Because of course, he only thinks about what’s in it for him. Let’s take what he said about John McCain, a great American hero, and Donald Trump says, “He doesn’t deserve to be called a hero because it was a prisoner of war.”"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Take, and this is very important when you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief and what they care about and what they don’t care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers. And you know what a bounty is? It’s somebody puts a price on your head and they will pay it if you are killed, and Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladimir Putin and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you-
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,But Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well. And I want to make sure we have a chance to talk about-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,I really have to respond to that. She has-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"15 seconds, because we’re trying to keep-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, I’ve got to have more then that. Look-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"I’m sorry, Vice President, but you’ve had more time than she said so far-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"I’m sorry, Vice President Pence-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"My son is in captain in the United States Marine Corps. My son-in-law’s deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump, not only respects, but reveres all of those who serve in our armed forces and any suggestion, otherwise is ridiculous. Let me also say the American people deserve to know-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Vice President Pence, I didn’t not create the rules for tonight-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… Joe Biden [crosstalk 00:20:00].
debate,Susan Page,2020,"… You’re campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate with the commission on president’s race. I’m here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I’m trying very hard to do."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Go right ahead.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"So, I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme court. Senator Harris, you’ll be there as a member of the committee."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Yes.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Her confirmation would submit the court’s conservative majority and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe V Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the States. Vice President Pence, you’re the former governor of Indiana. If Roe V Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general was responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans. President Trump didn’t hesitate and Qassem Soleimani is gone, but you deserve to know the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Qassem Soleimani. it’s really inexplicably, but with regard to Joe Biden, it’s explainable because history records a Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against a Osama bin Ladin. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American service members, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Now with regard to the Supreme court-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,[Silence].
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… become Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and she’s a brilliant woman and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizeable American family to the Supreme court of the United States, and our hope is in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Cavenaugh received with treatment from you and others, that we hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. I mean, the Democrat chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the court of appeals, expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly and her, and Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees you actually attacked, because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus. Just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President. Your time is up."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"… And [crosstalk 00:23:06]. So, my hope is that when the hearing takes place that-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,… That Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respectfully voted and confirmed into the Supreme court of the United States.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence. Thank you. Senator Harris, you’re the Senator from and former Attorney General of California. So, let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the Vice President. If Roe V Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith, and it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe, if elected, will be only the second practicing Catholic as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination, Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people, we are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next President of the United States, and before, when this conversation has come up, it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so, Joe has been very clear, as the American people are, let the American people fill that seat in the White House. And then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme court, and to your point, Susan, the issues before us, couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"It should be her decision and not that Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence, but let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act like literally in the midst of a public health pandemic when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a preexisting condition because you contracted the virus. Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and I said it before, and it bears repeating. This means that there will be no more protections if they win for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents’ coverage anymore, and here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator-"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage. Let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage. Let’s bring down premiums-
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Senator Harris.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,… Let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,That’s true leadership.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"You’ve mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the president was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration supporting that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says that he’s going to protect people with preexisting conditions, but he has not explained how he would do that, and that was one of the toughest nuts to crack when they were passing the Affordable Care Act. So, tell us specifically, how would your administration protect Americans with preexisting conditions to have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down?"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, thank you, Susan, but let me just say, addressing your very first question. I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it, and this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. Late term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. For our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States, but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden going to pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there’ve been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years from George Washington to Barack Obama."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases, but your party is actually openly advocating, adding seats to the Supreme court, which has had nine seats for 150 years if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question-"
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"No, you’ve refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. So I think the American people would really like to know if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed at the Supreme Court of the United States. Are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,I’m so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let’s do that a little more. In 1864-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"No, I’d like you to answer the question."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Yes, she’s-"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking, I’m speaking. Okay. In 1864, one of the, I think political heroes, certainly the President, I assume you also, Mr. Vice President, is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection and it was 27 days before the election. And a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln’s party was in charge, not only of the White House, but the Senate. But Honest Aid said, “It’s not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land.” And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you. Senator Harris-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"People, Susan, are voting right now. They’d like to know if you and Joe Biden are going to pack the Supreme Court if you don’t get your way in this nomination."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Let’s talk about packing-
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"You, once again, gave a non-answer. Joe Biden gave a non-answer."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,I’m trying to answer you now.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"You know the people deserve a straight answer, and if you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. Men and women, I got to tell you people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden Harris ticket come November the third, reelect President Donald Trump, and we’ll stand by that separation powers in a nine seats Supreme Court."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Yeah. Let’s talk about packing the court then. Let’s talk about the fact.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Please.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Yeah, I’m about to. So the Trump Pence administration has been, because I sit on the Senate judiciary committee, Susan as you mentioned, and I’ve witnessed the appointments for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, courts of appeal, people who are purely ideological, people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found who have been not competent are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the court of appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is black? This is what they’ve been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let’s have that discussion."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"All right. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let’s go on and talk about the issue of racial justice."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"I just want the record to reflect she never answered the question. Maybe in the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question, but I think the American people know the answer."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26 year old emergency room technician in Louisville was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant in an aquatics investigation, broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend said he didn’t hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self-defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor was justice done? You have two minutes."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"I don’t believe so. And I’ve talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer and her family and her family deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what’s going on out on the street so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken justifiably and tragically and violently. And it brings me to the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed uniformed police officer. And people around our country of every race, of every age, of every gender, perfect strangers to each other, marched shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"And I believe strongly that first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And that’s why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I’m a former career prosecutor. I know what I’m talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban choke holes and carotid holes. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law. We will, on the issue of criminal justice reform, get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,And we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This is a time for leadership-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"on a tragic, tragic issue-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Senator Harris, your time is up."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,Of honor on Black people in America who [crosstalk 00:34:11].
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American life and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that refuse the evidence. And it really is remarkable that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that an impaneled grand jury looking at all the evidence, got it wrong. But you’re entitled to your opinion, Senator. I think, and with regard to George Floyd, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served, but there’s also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake city. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, it was burned to the ground by rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"And I must tell you, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist, and that as Joe Biden said that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, President Trump and I stand with you. And it is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats, Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room and then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott’s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new repeat resources. We don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement, proving public safety and supporting our African-American neighbors and all of our minorities. Under President Trump’s leadership-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,We’ll always stand with law enforcement and we’ll do what we’ve done-
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Vice President Pence, thank you. Your time is up."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"From day one, it is improve the lives of African-Americans, record unemployment, record investments in education."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Vice President Pence. Vice President Pence, your time is up."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,We’ll fight for school choice for all of [crosstalk 00:36:46].
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,I’d like to respond.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Senator Harris.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"I will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. The only one on this stage, who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assault to homicide. I’m the only one on this stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of America’s homeowners. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,And the reality of this is that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week the President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,Not. Not true.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"And it wasn’t like he didn’t have a chance. He didn’t do it. And then he doubled down. And then he said, “when pressed, stand back, stand by.” And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump’s. He called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act, a Muslim ban. He on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed. And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis carrying Tiki torches, shouting racial epithets, anti-Semitic slurs. And Donald Trump when asked about it said, “There were fine people on both sides.” This is who we have as the President of the United States and America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Senator Harris.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,And recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Vice President let me give you a minute to respond.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Thank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think this is one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country, Susan, is that you selectively edit just like Senator Harris did, comments that President Trump and I and others on our side made. I mean, Senator Harris conveniently admitted after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. You’re concerned that he doesn’t condemn neo-Nazis. President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. His daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. This is a President who respects and cherishes all of the American people."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"But you talk about having personally prosecuted. I’m glad you brought up your record, Senator."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"I really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you left office, African-Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of blacks in California."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn’t lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. I mean, the reality is your record speaks for itself."
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice before-
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you Vice President.
debate,Mike Pence,2020,We fought for educational choice and opportunities for African-Americans and all of our members.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, sir."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,And we’ll do it for four more years.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you. There is no more important issue than the final issue that we’re going to talk about tonight and that is the issue of the election itself.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,But he attacked my record. I would like an opportunity to respond to.
debate,Susan Page,2020,Let me give you 30 seconds because we’re running out of time.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"I appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the state of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do, and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on choke holes and carotid holes-"
debate,Susan Page,2020,Thank you. Thank you Senator Harris.
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,I would like to go through-
debate,Susan Page,2020,These are points that you made earlier in the hour. And I want to talk about the election itself before we have to [crosstalk 00:41:13].
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"But I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do in my record, which includes I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full-time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias because yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in re-entry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward. And again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator-"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,And a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. And I’d like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and president Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and vice president Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"So I’ll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we’ve built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you’ve ever seen in a presidential race. Of course, we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans. In fact, seven members of president George W. Bush’s cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich. Over 500 generals, retired generals and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. We believe in the American people, we believe in our democracy, and here’s what I’d like to say to everybody. Vote, please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to Iwillvote.com. You can also go to Joebiden.com."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when, again, in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage, because clearly Donald Trump doesn’t think he can run on a record because it’s a failed record, Joe Biden on that stage said, Hey, just please vote. So I’ll repeat what Joe said. Please vote."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator. Vice president Pence, president Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If vice president Biden is declared the winner and president Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as vice president? What would you personally do? You have two minutes."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think we’re going to win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany of the establishment in Washington, DC and establishment that Joe Biden’s been a part of for 47 years, president Donald Trump has as launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this president’s record where we rebuild our military. We revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day. And I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"But when you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you. Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It’s amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on president Trump and my campaign. I mean, there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI, documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign. And of course, we’ve all seen the avalanche, what you put the country through for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that, in her words, under no circumstances, should he concede the election."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"So let me just say, I think we’re going to win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail in voting that’ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. And we have a free and fair election. We know we’re going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that president Donald Trump is going to be reelected for four more years."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"I’ve written all the questions that I’ve asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I’d like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask you. And I want to close tonight’s debate with the question posed by Brecklin Brown. She’s an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah. And here’s what she wrote. “When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidates from opposing parties trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can’t get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together.” So to each of you in turn, I’d like you to take one minute and respond to Brecklin. Vice president Pence, you have one minute."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"Brecklin, it’s a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that. It’s how we’ve created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. I would tell you that, don’t assume that what you’re seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people."
debate,Mike Pence,2020,"I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites on the Supreme Court of the United States. One very liberal one, very conservative. But what’s been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree. We can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And that’s what people do, in big cities and small towns all across this country. So I just want to encourage you, Brecklin. I want to tell you that we’re going to work every day to have government as good as our people, and the American people each and every day. Love a good debate. We love a good argument. But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need. And we’ve especially learned that through the difficulties of this year."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, vice president. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklin?"
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"First of all, I love hearing from our young leaders. And when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklin, I know our future is bright because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be that is a sign of leadership, and is something we should all aspire to be."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"And brings me to Joe, Joe Biden. One of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier. It so troubled him and upset him like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that over the course of the last four years, what Brecklin described has been happening."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Joe has a longstanding reputation of working across the aisle, and working in a bipartisan way. And that’s what he’s going to do as president. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You have to know Joe’s story to know that Joe has known pain. He has known suffering. And he has known love."
debate,Kamala Harris ,2020,"Brecklin, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be because we fight for each person’s voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work and through, eventually, your vote, to determine the future of our country and what its leadership looks like."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, vice president Pence. Thank you so much for being with us tonight."
debate,Susan Page,2020,"We want to thank also the University of Utah for its hospitality. And most of all, our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight. Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to president Trump, the First Lady, and everyone who is battling COVID-19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami. We hope you’ll join us then. Good evening."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"How you doing, man?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,How are you doing?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m well.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Thank you, Joe."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He’s elected to the next election.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s simply not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Open discussion.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is simply a lie.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I am the Democratic Party right now.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Not according to Harris.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m happy to talk about this.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, gentlemen, Mr. President."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You would have been much later, Joe, much later."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,We’re talking about two million people.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,You’re not going to be able to shut him up.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,It’s on the ballot in the court.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I don’t think so.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,In the court.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,There’s nothing happening there.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,All right.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s right.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You have spent the last week-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because they want to give good healthcare.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"If I may ask my question, sir."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Good healthcare.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,[crosstalk 00:11:26] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,That’s not a comprehensive place.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I didn’t ask, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I got rid of it. And we will protect people.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Go ahead.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,What about pre-existing conditions?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,All of the things that we’ve done.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He has not done healthcare.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Okay, like I say, this is open discussion."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,This is big stuff.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Yes.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,It is not.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,If I start asking the question.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That’s not what your party says, by the way."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Look, hey."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Are you saying you didn’t agree?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Not by much.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Not by much.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I’m here standing facing you, old buddy."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,All he knows how to do-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,With what?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And tonight I’m going to make sure.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,With what?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"God, I want to make sure-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No, he doesn’t know how to do that."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"There is no manifesto, number one."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Please let him speak, Mr. President."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Number two.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He just lost the left.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Number two.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Who is, Bernie?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’ve already fixed it.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He has never offered a plan.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Go ahead.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Please let the Vice President talk, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Good.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He has no plan for healthcare.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Of course, we do."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Please.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. [crosstalk 00:17:14]."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, I have one final question for you."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Sure.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Are you going to pack the court?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Vote now.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Are you going to pack the court?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He doesn’t want to answer the question.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m not going to answer the question.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Will you shut up, man?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who’s on your list?"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, I think we’ve ended this-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,This is so un-Presidential.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,We have ended the segment. We’re going to move on to the second segment.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"The people understand, Joe."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,They sure do.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"47 years, you’ve done nothing. They’re understand."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let’s try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Wrong.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Wrong.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Sir, it’s his two minutes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s so wrong.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So, if we would have listened to you."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Sir, it’s his two minutes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"14,000 people died, not 200,000."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"A far less lethal disease, by the way."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?"
debate,Chris Wallace:,2020,"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I’m going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,God.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"So you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"He talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I’m talking about when it’s generally available, not-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,This is the same man who told you-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s all set up.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"… by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,But you’re saying you can’t-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Everybody knows-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Or Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. You can trust the-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"She said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,By the way-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… they will have the vaccine very soon.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Let him finish.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Oh, give me a break."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, let’s have this debate-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Okay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Will he just shush for a minute?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 00:04:52] Chuck."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You probably play more than I do, Joe."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,What about this question of reopenings and the fact-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,You just admitted you’d shut it down.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,All right. I want to move onto another-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because it’s a political thing.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,I want to move onto another subject.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I got to respond to that.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,I want to move-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But those states-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I got to respond to that.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He wants to shut down the whole country.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Just like your rally.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… when needed. When needed, I wear masks."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Okay. Let me ask-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"But I was asking you, sir, about masks."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Okay. I want to ask you-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He did not say the opposite.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I want to ask you, we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.”"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,I want to ask-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Outside.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because nobody will show up.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,… people with masks.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,But are not worried about us spreading disease?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48]."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,We’ve had no negative effect.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,No negative effect. Come on.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,No cares.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Yes.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Much faster.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"… in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right. Your two minutes, sir. We’re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery. What’s the difference?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s wrong.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Sir, wait. No. Sir-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,[crosstalk 00:12:19].
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Yeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I have to respond to that.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Well, you both had two minutes, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me, he made a statement."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,And so did you.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,People want to be safe.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,People want to be safe.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,All right. Let’s-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk 00:14:35].
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Show us your tax returns.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Show us your tax returns.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But let me tell you-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,I understand all of that.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Release your tax return.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,I understand all of that-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Let me-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No, Mr. President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Millions of dollars.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You paid millions of dollars in-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Millions of dollars, yes."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,So not 750?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,When?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But let me just tell you-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,In [crosstalk 00:16:04]?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Vice President Biden, you want to respond?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s okay.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Because you weren’t president-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You were a Senator and [crosstalk 00:17:21]-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Okay. Gentlemen?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He has none.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"… if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"… on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Why didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I got it done. And you know what happened?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yeah, you got it done-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,The economy-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Let me finish.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not lower tax for the American people.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,But let me-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places. [crosstalk 00:20:25] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Look-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. Vice President.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"… we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It wasn’t blooming.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He blew it.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,When COVID came along.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,… when there was record low unemployment before COVID.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Excuse me, Chris, wait."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,… number one. Number two-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Chris.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Number three.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They said it would take… No, you’re on number two."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,No.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Chris, Chris. They said it would take-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,This guy-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,We did not. [crosstalk 00:21:21]
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… standard fare.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He totally gave up on manufacturing.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, let him-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. [crosstalk 00:21:47]."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. Vice President, go ahead."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,China ate your lunch- [crosstalk 00:00:22:07].
debate,Joe Biden,2020,… with Mexico.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,None of that is true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… to deserve $183,000?"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,None of that is true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Is totally-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, please. You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk 00:22:41]"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Mr. Vice-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He got three and a half million-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… dollars.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, really?"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, it’s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk 00:22:56]"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s a fact.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,It is not a fact.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,It’s been totally discredited.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy?"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,My son did nothing wrong at Barisma-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I think he did.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, let him answer. [crosstalk 00:23:13]."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,By who?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And you can-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,The media.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,By the World Bank-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… because they’re embarrassed.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By everyone, has discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk 00:23:30] Matter of fact-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, please stop."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Even the people who testified under oath-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk 00:23:35]."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Go ahead, I’m listening to you."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Even the people under-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,… testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, really?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I did it honorably.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’d like to know who they are.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’ll fire them.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No, no. Go ahead, sir."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Some people don’t do a good job.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, here’s the- [crosstalk 00:23:57]"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk 00:23:57] Wait a minute. You get the final word, Mr.-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Hey, let me just tell you, Joe-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk 00:24:05]"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Three and a half million, Joe."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is simply not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,My family-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No, no- [crosstalk 00:06:20]."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And that’s such a- [crosstalk 00:24:25]
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. President-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Every single one of them lost a fortune-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk 00:24:32] That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. [crosstalk 00:24:42]"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He didn’t take that.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Vice President-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Try to be honest.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,No.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He stood up-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,The answer to the question is no.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… and the threatened Ukraine-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Sir-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… with a billion dollars-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is absolutely not true.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Stop. [crosstalk 00:25:02] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk 00:25:05] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s a good point.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, and him too."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Well, sir, less than-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He does plenty.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of rice. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh yeah, sure."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s true.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk 00:27:10]."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,It is his-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Now-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,… minute sir.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"… second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,So-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’ve never said-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No, no, sir. It’s his two minutes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, Mr.-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,President Trump-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk 00:32:14].
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not peaceful protest.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No it’s not, but you say it is."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Fine.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- [crosstalk 00:33:02]"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,What is radical about racial sensitivity training?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Vice President Biden.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You just don’t know.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 00:15:43].
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Let him finish.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Oh my Lord.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But the reason-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,This is ridiculous.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… is that the Democrats that run these cities-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Absolutely ridiculous.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Violent crime-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And you still haven’t mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m in favor of law. You- [crosstalk 00:35:15].
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk 00:35:17]
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk 00:35:18] Let him answer."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Okay.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It went down much more in ours.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, we’re done- [crosstalk 00:35:35] Mr. President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a…"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"It’s like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, I know suburbs so much that you."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Gentlemen wait a minute.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be…"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s not what they are talking about this. That’s not what it is about. He’s talking about defunding the police.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,We don’t have time to do anything.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to tell I’m going to take back the bottom line."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,There aren’t any.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I don’t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,But you’ve never called for the people…
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He’s never done that.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Go ahead sir.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I don’t know who said that.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I do.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Who?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I think Kellyanne Conway.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I don’t think she said that.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,She said that.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I don’t think so.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Okay. And to end this, button up this segment I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly criticized…"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Does it mean I have to answer his stuff.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You have repeatedly…
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Wait a second, you have made a statement."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I would love to end it.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But I don’t want to accept the National Guard."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Sure, I’m will to do that."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Are you prepared specifically to do it.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,But what are you saying?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Well, do it, sir."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Say it, do it say it."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,White supremacist and right-wing militia.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Oh you got to be kidding me.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,… not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, then you know what, he’s wrong."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"We’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… [crosstalk 00:42:46]"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Antifa is bad.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Every body in your administration tells you the true, it’s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You son got three and a half million dollars.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, my son…"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, you’re a side agreed to it and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He never keeps his word.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No, that was a rhetorical question."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Can you get back 30 seconds?
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Yes. You may have, go ahead."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Really?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And I resent-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,For cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,None of that is true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He made a fortune and he didn’t have a job.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not true. That report is totally discredited.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Why did he get it?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,I’d like to talk about climate change.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,So would I.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,But in the case of California they have simply ignored that.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, Vice president Biden. I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do…"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he’s drawn his line."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, he hasn’t drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Not true. Not true-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,It’s all true. And here’s the deal-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion [crosstalk 00:55:45] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 00:55:46]. It’s $100 trillion."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 00:55:51]-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Let him go for a minute, and then you can go."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And rebuild the building.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,No.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s the dumbest-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… most ridiculous [crosstalk 00:55:56] where two car systems are out-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not true-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… where they want to take out the cows too.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"That’s not true either, right?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not true.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,This is a 100 trillion-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Simply… Look-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,That’s more money than our country could make in 100 years [crosstalk 00:02:10]-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is simply not the case-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right. Let me [crosstalk 00:02:12]. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs [crosstalk 00:02:41]."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Let him finish, sir."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,He doesn’t know how to do that-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,100 million dollars.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I never said that at all-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yeah, he did say that-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,They made it up.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And here’s the deal-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You make up a lot-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"… we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, gentlemen-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were vice president-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,For 47-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That is not my plan [crosstalk 00:58:10]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk 00:58:14] is not my plan. [crosstalk 00:58:15]-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Gentlemen-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Okay. [crosstalk 00:58:24] Mr. Vice President-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He called the military stupid bastards.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I did not say that-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,He said it on tape. [crosstalk 00:58:32]-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Please, sir. [crosstalk 00:58:33] Stop."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I would never say that [crosstalk 00:58:35]-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Play it. Play it-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Stop. Go ahead-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You’re on tape-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Mr. Vice President answered his final question.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 00:04:44]."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I’m having a little trouble myself, but…"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Yeah.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,The economy-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"So, do you support the Green New Deal?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Pardon me?
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Do you support the-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No, I don’t support the Green New Deal."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I support [crosstalk 00:05:13]-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You just lost the radical left.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I support [crosstalk 00:59:17] the Biden plan that I put forward.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Okay.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Mr. President, two minutes."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"He knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"But you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Sir.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… all run by Democrats-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Two minutes is two minutes.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,All run by Democrats.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,President Trump-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s a rigged election.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"You’re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged [crosstalk 00:01:04:11], that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don’t like them. We don’t like them. They throw them out-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,But what are you going to do about it-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… left and right.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,No. No. I know your complaint [crosstalk 01:05:05]. I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You go and vote. You go and vote-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No. But what I’m saying is [crosstalk 01:05:11], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,There is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]… There is no evidence of that-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,This is not going to end well.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,There is no evidence of that-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,This is not going to end well-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Okay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You’re wrong. You’re wrong [crosstalk 01:06:04]. I love counting the votes [crosstalk 01:06:05]-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,I want to continue with you on this [crosstalk 01:06:06] Vice President Biden-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"Chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,All right.
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Excuse me [crosstalk 01:07:11]-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"No. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk 00:13:12]. Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk 01:07:14]-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"You know it can’t be done. You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud [crosstalk 01:07:19]-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Mail service delivers [crosstalk 01:07:21] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 01:07:24]-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"We can keep talking. In eight states, [crosstalk 01:07:27] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,Could be months-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"… until we find out who the new president is. First for you, sir. Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,You’re urging them what?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"… I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you why-"
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"What does that mean, not go along-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,… from a common sense-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Does that mean you’re going to tell your people-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I’ll tell you what it means-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,… to take to the streets?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,And what would you do about that?
debate,Donald Trump,2020,"They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them."
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,Vice President Biden-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,You think that’s good?
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s what’s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process."
debate,Donald Trump,2020,It’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 01:10:13]. Go ahead [crosstalk 01:10:14]. Vice President Biden, go ahead."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I want to see an honest ballot cut-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"Gentlemen, just say that’s the end of it [crosstalk 01:10:45]. This is the end of this debate-"
debate,Donald Trump,2020,I want to see an honest ballot count.
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,We’re going to leave it there-
debate,Donald Trump,2020,And I think he does too-
debate,Chris Wallace,2020,"… to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night. Thank you."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Hey, and welcome to our town hall with Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, welcome to you."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Good to be with you.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"We’re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters. You can see they’re all appropriately socially distanced tonight. And there are a group of, some are voting for you, some have said they’re voting for president Trump, some are still undecided, and we’re going to try to take questions from as many of them as we can tonight."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Okay.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"And we’re going to start with Nicholas Fed, and he’s from Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. That’s close to here, in Philadelphia."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I know it well.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,You’re a Democrat.
debate,Nicholas Fed,2020,"I’m a Democrat. Thank you, George. Mr. Vice President, every day, my wife and I are in disbelief at the lack of coordinated federal action on COVID-19. We know that your administration would follow the science. My question for you, it’s two parts. First, looking backwards to when this country first became aware of COVID-19, what would following the science have meant in terms of actual policy? And then, looking forward, what would your administration do in terms of following the science with real concrete policies that haven’t been done by the current administration?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, first of all, going back, the fact is that the president was informed how dangerous this virus was. And all the way back in the beginning of February, I argued that we should be keeping people in China. And we had set up, in our administration, a pandemic office within the White House. There were 44 people on the ground."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I suggested that we should be seeking, and I didn’t hold public office, I was a former Vice President, we in fact asked to have access to the source of the problem. And the best of our knowledge, Trump never pushed that. All those 44 people came home, never got replaced. In addition to that, I pointed out that I thought in February, I did a piece for USA Today saying, “This is a serious problem. Trump denied it. He said it wasn’t.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We later learned that he knew full well how serious it was when he did an interview with George Woodward. I mean, excuse me, Bob Woodward. And at the time, he said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic. Americans don’t panic, he panicked. He didn’t say a word to anybody."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Then I wrote a piece in March about what I thought we should be doing to take hold of this, using the… There’s an act that passed a long time ago that allows the president to go into a business and say, “Stop making this, and start making that.” And it took a long time for him to even institute that, to get ventilators and so on. And so, the point was he missed enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren’t true. It’s going to go away by Easter, don’t worry about it. When the summer comes, it’s all going to go away like a miracle. He’s still saying those things."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Before you go to the future, can I follow up on the, “I’m looking backwards.” just a little bit? You did have an op-ed in January where you warned of the seriousness of the pandemic, but there’s no record of you calling for social distancing, limited social gatherings, mandatory mask-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Not back then.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"In January, February."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Not in January, February. No, that’s correct, there wasn’t. That came at the end of March. And then I laid out a detailed plan relative to school openings in June and July. By that time, the science was becoming clearer and clearer of how this was spreading so rapidly. But the president kept denying that. If you notice, from March on, I stopped doing big meetings, I started wearing masks."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So, it was at a time when the science was saying, and his key people, Dr. Fauci were saying, “You should be taking these precautions.” So, what we should be doing now, there should be a national standard. Instead of leaving this up to, remember what the president said to the governors, “Well, they’re on their own, it’s not my responsibility. The governors can do what they need to do, not my responsibility.” It is a presidential responsibility to lead, and he didn’t do that."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He didn’t talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market. He worried if he talked about how bad this could be, unless we took these precautionary actions, then in fact, the market would go down. And his barometer of success to the economy is the market."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Thirdly, what we didn’t do is, the president had an opportunity to open and allow schools and businesses to stay open if they got the kind of help they needed. So, the Congress passed a couple of trillion dollars worth of help. And what happened was most of that money, a significant portion of that money went to the very wealthiest corporations in the country, didn’t get to the mom and pop stores."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So, you had one in five, one in six minority businesses closing. Many of them permanently. People being laid off. And then what happened was, when the first round of money for unemployment, enhanced unemployment went by, he didn’t do anything. He didn’t do anything. And to the best of my knowledge, and I mean this sincerely, I can’t think of, I’ve been around for a lot of presidents, and you know a lot of presidents in a crisis, I don’t ever remember one never calling the House and Senate Republicans, Democrats together."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Let’s look forward a little bit. You said that you would lock down the economy, only if the scientists said it was necessary."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"By the way, in the context, would I lock down the economy if science said so? I said I’d follow science. But I don’t think there’s a need to lock down."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Yeah, but I want to press you on that point. You’ve been in the Oval Office for eight years with President Obama, he would always say that only the hard to solve problems-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,[crosstalk 00:06:15] Get there.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"What is most likely to happen is, the scientists will disagree. The scientists will disagree with the economist. So the question is, how are you going to decide this? Who are you going to listen to? And how can you can contain the pandemic without crushing the economy?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, you can contain the pandemic by being rational and not crush economy. For example, I laid out a plan, how you can open businesses. You can open businesses and schools, if in fact you provide them the guidance that they need, as well as the money to be able to do it. What’s happening now is, we know, for example, if you can open a business and you could have a sign on the door saying, “Safe to come in.” And that’s why people aren’t going anyway, when they’re open."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And say, because you have social distancing, you have plastic barriers, when you go to the cashier, you have separators between the booths. You don’t have large crowds, you reduce the size, the number of people you can have in the restaurant. You make sure there’s testing, that’s a really critical piece that he didn’t do testing and tracing. And you make sure that people are equipped, going to schools."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"You know, we initially said, the government initially said, they’re going to provide masks for every student and every teacher. Then they said, “No, no, no, no.” FEMA said, the president or whomever said, ‘No, no, no. That’s not a national emergency, not a national emergency.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We need more teachers in our schools to be able to open smaller pods. We need ventilation systems change. There’s a lot of things we know now, and I laid them out in some detail. Now again, when I say I laid them out, I’m not an office holder. I’m running for office. It’s not like I’m still Vice President, or I wasn’t a United States Senator pushing this."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So, I don’t want to say, “I, I, I.” But we did lay out exactly what needed to be done. And take a look, we make up 4% of the world’s population. We have 20% of the world’s deaths. We’re in a situation where we have 210 plus thousand people dead. And what’s he doing? Nothing. He’s still not wearing masks, and so on."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,We’re getting some other questions on COVID.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Sure.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,The next one comes from Kelly Lee. She’s from Philadelphia.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Thank you.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,Republican. Voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
debate,Kelly Lee,2020,I did.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,Undecided now.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Hey, Kelly. How are you?"
debate,Kelly Lee,2020,"Hi, Mr. Biden. My question is about the coronavirus vaccine, or potential."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Yes.
debate,Kelly Lee,2020,"Senator Harris stated that she absolutely would not take a vaccine from President Trump. And of course, we all know it’s not President Trump that would create this vaccine. It would be doctors and scientists that presumably we all trust. So, my question for you is if a vaccine were approved between now and the end of the year, would you take it? And if you were to become president, would you mandate that everyone has to take it?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Two things. Number one, President Trump talks about things that just aren’t accurate, about everything from vaccines, we’re going to have one right away, is it going to happen, and so on. The point is that, if the scientists, if the body of scientists say that this is what is ready to be done, and it’s been tested, they’ve gone through the three phases. Yes, I would take it. I’d encourage people to take it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"But President Trump says things like, everything from this crazy stuff he’s walking away from now, inject bleach in your arm, and that’s going to work. I’m not being facetious, he’s actually said these things. And now, Regeneron is the answer. That’s going to cure everything. There’s 500,000 doses, we have more than a few million people, you know? And so, if you noticed, most of the companies who are developing these vaccines are working, they’re making real progress."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I meet with four leading scientists, at least twice a week. In the beginning, four times a week, giving us the detail on what kind of progress is being made. And right now, they do the right thing. When they run into a serious problem, they halt the test. They don’t continue until they figure out what the problem was. They’re not there yet."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And the most scientists say, that it’s not likely to have a vaccine that would be available until the beginning of next year, into the spring of next year. And in the meantime, what I worry about is the same thing with Regeneron, which is a useful antidote. Not antidote, a useful tool. But what’s happening is there was no plan to figure out how to distribute it. We have 500,000 vials of it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, we don’t have all the testing equipment. We don’t have all the ability to get it to the people who need it. And what we should be doing now, and allegedly it’s happening, but I’ve not seen it yet nor the docs that I’ve talked to seen it. There should be a plan when we have the vaccine, how do we distribute it?"
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"And once we get it, if it’s safe, if it’s effective, will you mandate its use?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The answer is, depending on how clear… Vaccines, they say, have a very positive impact and that you’re going to affect positively 85% of the American public. Or there’s others say, “This vaccine is really the key. This is the golden key.” It depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes out, and how it’s being distributed. But I would think that we should be talking about, depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,How would you enforce that?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, you couldn’t, that’s the problem. Just like you can’t enforce measles, you can’t come to school unless you have a measles shot. You know, you can’t. But you can’t say, everyone has to do this, just like you can’t mandate a mask. But you can say, you can go to every governor and get them all in a room, all 50 of them as president and say, ” Ask people to wear the mask. Everybody knows.”"
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,And if they don’t? Fines?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And if they don’t, no. Not fine. Then I go to every governor, I go to every mayor, I go to every councilmen, and I go to every local official, say, “Mandate the mask.” Say, “This is what you have to do when you’re out. Make sure you encourage it being done.” Look, George, you and I know, and I think you do too as well, the words of a president matter."
debate,Kelly Lee,2020,Absolutely.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No matter whether they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter. And when a president doesn’t wear a mask or makes fun of folks like me, when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then people say, “Well, it mustn’t be that important.” But when a president says, “I think this is very important.” For example, I walked in here with this mask, but I have one of the N95 masks underneath it. I left it in my dressing room. Not the dresser, the room I was in before I got here."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And so, I think it matters what we say. And we’re now learning that children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but there’s been no studies done yet on vaccines for children. So, there’s a long way to go, but we can make progress in the meantime and save lives."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And the last point I’ll make, if you listen to the head of the CDC, he stood up and he said, “You know, while we’re waiting for a vaccine.” He held up a mask. “You wear this mask, you’ll save more lives between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine.” It’s estimated by every major study done from the University of Washington to Columbia, that if in fact we wore masks, we could save, between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,And avoid lock downs?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And avoid lockdown, yes. You don’t have to lock down if you’re wearing the mask."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,Let’s get a question on the economy. Anthony Archer-
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Thank you, I hope I answered your question."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"… from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, it’s a suburb of Pittsburgh. Republican."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I know it.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,Voted for President Trump.
debate,Anthony Archer,2020,"Thank you, George. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. You stated that anyone making less than $400,000 will not see one single penny of their taxes raised."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,That’s right.
debate,Anthony Archer,2020,"But also, state that you are going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. The Trump tax cuts reduces taxes for the majority of workers. I would argue, not enough. What is your plan for either extending the tax cuts for the middle-class, or creating a new plan that further reduces those taxes?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I carry this card with me. When I said the Trump tax cuts, about 1.3 trillion of the $2 trillion in his tax cuts went to the top one 10th of 1%. That’s what I’m talking about eliminating, not all the tax cuts that are out there. And by the way, if you take a look, we reduced the corporate tax rate from 35%. and Democrats, Republicans who were in office thought it should come down to 28%. He reduced it to 21%."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"You have 91 out of the Fortune 500 companies not paying a single solitary penny. If you raise the corporate tax back to 28%, which is a fair tax, you’d raise one trillion, three hundred billion dollars by that one act. If you made sure that people making over 400 grand paid what they did in the Bush administration, 39.6%, you would raise another, it goes up to let me get you the exact number here, about another 200, excuse me. $92 billion."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So, you could raise a lot of money to be able to invest in things that can make your life easier. Make you change your standard of living by making sure you have affordable health care, by making sure you’re in a situation where you’re able to send your kid to school. If you have student debt, you can deal with it. Making sure that your home, you can pay your mortgage. You got 20 million people, right now."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Mr. Vice President, let me press you on that though."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Sure.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"You’re going to raise the corporate tax, you’re going to raise taxes on the wealthy. Is it wise to do even that when the economy is as weak as it is right now?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Absolutely.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Another 900,000 people have filed for unemployment."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"That’s a great question. Moody’s did analysis of my detailed analysis of my tax plan and my economic plan. They said, I will, in four years, Moody’s Wall Street, said I will create 18.6 million new jobs, good paying jobs, number one. Number two, the GDP will grow by a trillion dollars more than would under Trump, and 7 million more jobs than under Trump."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And the reason is, when you allow people to get back in the game and have a job, everything moves. Everything moves. Right now, you got the opposite. You had, last year during this pandemic, you had the wealthiest billionaires in the world, in the nation, they made another $700 billion. $700 billion. He talks about a V-shape recovery. It’s a K shape recovery. If you’re on the top, you’re going to do very well. And if you’re in the bottom, or you’re in the middle or the bottom, your income is coming down. You’re not getting a raise."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I shouldn’t, I don’t know what you do. You may get a raise. Hope you’re a billionaire. But all kidding aside, it’s about growing the economy. And George, the way out, the reason why I’m so optimistic about economic recovery, more than I’ve ever been, is we have these four crises happening all at once. And one helps the other. For example, we’re going to invest a great deal of that money into infrastructure, and to a green infrastructure."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"We’re going to put 500,000 charging stations on new highways we’re building, and all highways we’re building. We’re going to own the electric market. You know as well as I do from your days, you know, in the old days, where the president spends about $600 billion a year on government contracts. Everything from making sure they have aircraft carriers, to automobile fleets in the United States."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"If you make, and it’s not in violation of any international trade agreement, made in America. If you actually insist that whatever that product is, made in America, including the material that goes into the product. It is estimated we’re going to create somewhere between another four and six million jobs just by doing that."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"But what’s happening now under his trade policy, a lot of this is going overseas. You get a benefit from going overseas, if you have much of it being made overseas. So, if you send it overseas, you get a 10% tax increase on a product. If you make it in America and you bring it back, you get a 10% growth. If you bring back a company, and you’re going to open up an old facility, you get a 10% tax credit for all you invested. That actually works, George."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"So, there’s not going to be any delay on the tax increases?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No, well. I got to get the votes. I got to get the votes. That’s why, the one thing, I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends, even occasionally say, “Well, if you can’t get the votes by executive order, you’re going to do something. Things you can’t do by executive order, unless you’re a dictator.” We’re democracy, we need consensus."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,Got to take a quick break. We’ll be right back.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I hope I answered your question.

debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"And welcome back to our town hall with Joe Biden. We’re going to get a question now from Cedric Humphrey. He’s a student from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Progressive Democrat."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Don’t jump, Cedric. You’re look like you’re way up there."
debate,Cedric Humphrey,2020,"I’ll be okay. Thank you, George. And good evening, former Vice President Biden."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Good evening.
debate,Cedric Humphrey,2020,Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be-
debate,Cedric Humphrey,2020,"Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be Black voters under the age of 30, not because they’ll be voting for Trump, but because they won’t vote at all. I myself have had this exact same conflict. So my question for you then is, besides “You ain’t Black,” what do you have to say to young Black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to protect them?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, I’d say first of all, as my buddy John Lewis said, “It’s a sacred opportunity, the right to vote. You can make a difference.” If young Black women and men vote, you can determine the outcome of this election. Not a joke. You can do that. Then the next question is, am I worthy of your vote? Can I earn your vote? And the answer is, there’s two things I think that I care and I’ve demonstrated I care about my whole career. One is, in addition to dealing with a criminal justice system to make it fairer and make it more decent, we have to be able to put Black Americans in a position to be able to gain wealth, generate wealth. And so you look at what that entails."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"It entails everything from early education, that’s why I’m supporting making sure that Title One schools, as you know, schools with the least tax base to be able to support their schools, I increased the funding from them from $15 to $45 billion. That allows every teacher in that school to make up to 60,000 bucks, and the problem now is they’re leaving the schools. They’re not there. We’re short about a million and a half teachers, a million and a quarter teachers."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Number two, every three and four and five-year-old will go to school, school, not daycare, school, and with all the great universities, including the one you’ve gone to, go to, or went to, in fact, talks about in the last eight years, what’s happened. What happens when you let them go to school? They make up rapidly whatever shortcoming they had in terms of their education prior to that. They have not heard as many words spoken, et cetera, et cetera. What happens is that, the studies show, that 58% will increase by 58% their chance of going all through 12 years of school, and going through successfully. It will also provide for the ability to bring in social workers and school psychologists. We have one school psychologist in America now for every 1,507 kids. It should be one to 500, not just in schools that are poor, but in all schools, because we learned that, for example, drug abuse doesn’t cause mental illness, mental illness causes drug abuse, the failure to get hold of people and deal with their anxieties."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"In addition to that, I provide for a $70 billion for HBC use for them to be able to have the wherewithal to do what other universities can do, because they don’t have the kind of foundational support they need. And so that would allow them, for example, like we did in our administration, the President allowed me to go down and we awarded a cybersecurity laboratory, ability to compete for cybersecurity laboratory. The federal government spends billions of dollars a year on universities, because there are the best kept secret and where most of the major inventions come out of. And so that school now will be able to produce young Black women and men who are going to go into a field of the future that’s burgeoning, cybersecurity. And that’s what is going to help a great deal."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"In addition to that, if you’re a young man about to graduate and you graduated from school and you want to own your first home, well, it’s awful hard to get the money, depending on the background, where your economic background is, to get a down payments. So we’re going to guarantee first term home buyers a $15,000 down payment for first term home buyers. In addition to that, all the studies now show, and I’ve been arguing this for a long time, is young Black entrepreneurs are just as successful as White entrepreneurs or anyone else given a shot. But you can’t get the money. Where do you go to get the startup money? So what President Obama and I did, we had a program where we took $1.5 billion and we invested it in all the SBAs around the country, and the state SBAs, small business associations, and that generated $30 billion came off the sideline."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because if you have a guarantee of $200,000 for your new startup enterprise, a young entrepreneur, you’re going to be able to attract, if it’s government money and it’s a guarantee, you could be able to attract another $100,000. It generated $30 billion. Well, I’m changing that program and I’ll get this done without much trouble I believe in the Congress from $1.5 million to $30 billion. That’ll take $300 billion off the sideline and grow. And, for example, if you, in fact, and I were the same age and we split our differences, if we were the same age, and we went to the same builder to buy us each the same home, but my home was in a White neighborhood on one side of a highway, and yours is in a Black neighborhood, same exact home, your home will start off being valued 29% less than my home. Yet your insurance for that home will be higher. You’ll be taxed more for it. We’ve got to end this. That’s what got me involved in politics in the first place, a thing called red lining."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,We can change so much that we can do so much to change the circumstances to give people a real opportunity.
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,Cedric. Is that right? Did you hear what you needed here?
debate,Cedric Humphrey,2020,I think so.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, there’s a lot more if you’re going to hang around afterwards. I’ll tell you more."
debate,Cedric Humphrey,2020,Okay.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"No, but I really mean it. It’s the key. Look, this is the way every other … Like my dad, he lost his job up in Scranton and it took him three years to be able to move down to Delaware, to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town, and send us home to our grandpop to live with him. We finally got back. We lived in an apartment, which became six and eight housing much later. It was just normal apartments. But it took him five years to be able to buy a home. Well, we bought a three bedroom home with four kids and a grandpop living with us, but it accumulated wealth. You built up wealth. That’s how middle-class folks make it. They build up wealth. Then he was able to borrow a little against that to be able to help us get the school, those kinds of things. It’s about accumulating wealth and you’re behind an eight ball. The vast majority of people of color are behind an eight ball."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And it’s the same way what’s going on now with all this money that’s been voted. What’s happened? You go to the bank, if you’re a Black businessman, and the President fired the only Inspector General to see oversee all this help coming from the Congress. And what happens? You go in and they say, “Ah, do you have an account here?” “No.” “Do you have a credit card?” “No.” “Have you borrowed from us before ?” “No.” We bailed these suckers out. They’re not liable for any of the money, but they still won’t lend it to you. We’ve got to change that. It’s about accumulating wealth."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,I want to get another question in here from Angelica Politarhos.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m sorry.
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"No, not at all. Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania."
debate,Angelia Politarhos,2020,Hi.
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,Republican who voted for President Trump last time.
debate,Angelia Politarhos,2020,"Thank you. Thank you, George. Thank you, Vice President Biden. Nice to meet you. What’s your view on the Crime Bill that you wrote 1994, which showed prejudice against minorities? Where do you stand today on that?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, first of all, things have changed drastically. That Crime Bill, when it voted, the Black Caucus voted for it. Every Black mayor supported it across the board and the Crime Bill itself did not have mandatory sentences except for two things. It had three strikes and you’re out, which I voted against, in the Crime Bill, but it had a lot of other things in it that turned out to be both bad and good. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. That was part of the assault weapons ban and other things that were good. What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they could build, state prison systems. And you have 93 out of every 100 people in jail now is in a state prison, not in a federal prison, because they built more prisons."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I also wrote into that bill a thing called drug courts. I don’t believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use. They should be going into mandatory rehabilitation. We should be building rehab centers to have these people housed. We should decriminalize marijuana, wipe out the record so you can actually say honesty, “You ever been arrested for murder for anything?” You can say no, because we’re going to pass a law saying there is no background that you have to reveal relative to the use of marijuana. And so there’s a lot of things. But in addition to that, we’ve got to change the system. I joined with a group of people in the House to provide for changing the system from punishment to rehabilitation. Along with a guy named Marlon Specter, who you may remember, I wrote the Second Chance Act."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"In the meantime, an awful lot of people were jailed for minor drug crimes after the Crime Bill."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Right.
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,Was it a mistake to support it?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yes, it was. But here’s where the mistake. The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally. What we did federally, we said, you remember, George, it was all about the same time for the same crime. What I had done as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I took the 10 Circuit Courts of Appeals, took some really brilliant lawyers working for me in Judiciary, we did a study and we determined what happens if, for the first, second, third offense for any crime in the criminal justice system at the federal level, if you’re a Black man and it’s the first time you’ve committed robbery, how long would you go to jail? On average? If you’re White man, how long? The Black man would go to jail on average 13 years. White man, two years. I’d go down the list of every single crime."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So we set up a sentencing commission. We didn’t set the time. Every single solitary maximum was reduced in there. But what happened was it became the same time for the same crime. So it said, “You have to serve between one and three years.” And it ended up becoming much lower, Black folks went to jail a lot less than they would have before. But it was a mistake."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"Let me ask another follow-up on the Crime bill. It also funded 100,000 police back in 1994. You’ve often said that more cops clearly mean less crime. Do you still believe that?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yes, if in fact they’re involved in community policing, not jump squads. For example, when we had community policing, from the mid-’90s on until till Bush got elected, what happened? Violent crime actually went down precipitous. Remember the significant rise in violent crime that was occurring in the late ’80s into the ’90s. It went down and fewer African Americans were arrested because you had the requirement. The cops didn’t like it. They didn’t like the community policing, because you had to have two people in the vehicle, they had to get out of their cars, they had to introduce themselves to who own the local liquor store, who owned the local grocery store, who was the woman on the corner. And what they would do, George, they’d actually go and give people their phone numbers. A cop would give the phone number."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"So if Nelly Smith was on the second floor where drug deals took place and things happened below her apartment, she could call and say, “It’s Millie, and there’s something going on here.” And they’d never revealed it was her, because they’d know, if she knew that, in fact, they report, they’d never report the crime, she’d never report. So it actually started to come down. And what happened? They eliminated the funding for community policing. Community policing doesn’t mean more people coming in, in armored Humvees and swarming. It turned out that by the time we got to the late ’90s and crime had come down so much, the mayors and everybody asked the question, “Where do you want me to spend the money?” They say, “Well, only 1% thought violent crime was a problem.” It was as high as 22%."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"Right now we have a systemic problem. How do you get the kind of policing, prevent the kind of policing [crosstalk 00:35:55]."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"You have to change the way in which they [inaudible 00:35:55]. One of the things I’m going to do, George, is what is set up a national study group made up of cops, social workers, as well as made up of the Black community and the Brown community to sit down in the White House and over the next year come up with significant reforms that need to take place within communities. You have to bring them together. One of the things I’ve observed is, the neighborhood I grew up, I grew up in Claymont, you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn’t qualified much to do any one of them, but here’s the deal, all kidding aside. Most cops don’t like bad cops."
debate,Angelia Politarhos,2020,Correct.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,They don’t like it.
debate,Angelia Politarhos,2020,That’s correct.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And so what happens is they get intimidated into not reporting. So one of the things we do is there has to be transparency available. We have to be able to go in at the federal level, be able to go in and check out whether or not there’s systematic problems within police departments. If, in fact, a cop needs to be tried, it’s not the prosecutor in the community, in the district there. You’ve got to go outside the community to get another prosecutor to come in to handle the crime. There’s a lot of things we’ve learned, and it takes time but we can do this. You can ban choke holds, but beyond that, you have to teach people how to de-escalate circumstances. De-escalate. So instead of anybody coming at you and the first thing you do is shoot to kill, you shoot them in the leg. There’s ways you have to do more background checks in terms of whether or not the person coming in, passes a certain psychological test."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And the last thing I’ll say, and I’m sorry, but it’s really, I think, really, really important, is you have to be in a position where you are able to identify, identify the things that have to change. And one of the things that has to change is so many cops get called into circumstances where somebody is mentally off. Like what happened not long ago, that guy with the knife. That’s why we have to provide within police departments psychologists and social workers to go out with the cops on those calls, some of those 911 calls to de-escalate the circumstance, to deal with talking them down. But cops are kind of like school teachers now. A school teacher has to know everything from how to handle hunger in a household as well as how to teach how to read. Well, cops or don’t have that breadth, and there’s a lot of things we can do. We shouldn’t be defunding cops. We should be mandating the things that we should be doing within police departments and make sure there’s total transparency."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,Got to take another quick break. We’ll be right back.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I don’t know the answer to your question.
debate,Speaker 1,2020,"He shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States. From the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"And the Supreme Court is our next topic. The questioner, Nathan Osburn of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Democrat."
debate,Nathan Osburn,2020,"Hi, I’m George and Mr. Vice President."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Hey, Nathan."
debate,Nathan Osburn,2020,"Our country’s first Supreme Court gave its first ruling is just two blocks from here from 1791 to 1800, and it’s become more polarized since then. Merrick Garland didn’t get a hearing for all of 2016 and Amy Coney Barrett is being pushed through at the last minute, even though millions have already voted. So what do you think about ideas from people like Pete Buttigieg and others to put in place safeguards that will help ensure more long-term balance and stability? And what do you say to LGBTQ Americans and others who are very worried right now about erosions of their rights and our democracy as a whole?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, let me start at the last point and work my way back. I think there’s great reason to be concerned. I was on the road most of the time during these hearings so I didn’t hear many of them. I just got the recaps when I’d get in late at night. I’m been going around the country, Florida, anyway, but my reading online what the judge said was she didn’t answer very many questions at all. And I don’t even think she is laid out much of a judicial philosophy in terms of the basis upon which she thinks are there unenumerated rights in the Constitution, nonetheless. So, number one. So I think there’s great reason to be concerned for the LGBT community, something I fought very hard for, for a long time to make sure there’s equality across the board."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Number two, I think that also healthcare overall is very much in jeopardy as a consequence of the President’s going to go directly after this election directly to the Supreme Court within a month to try to get Obamacare wiped out after 10 million people have already lost her insurance from their employer and wants to take 20 million people out of the system as well, plus 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. So there’s a lot at stake. I don’t think it’s appropriate. I think the Constitution implies, there’s no provision in the Constitution, my problem is I made a mistake of teaching constitutional law for 21 years, and the separation of powers, the Constitution implies that their way the people have a right to determine who’s going to be on the court is how they vote for their Senators and their President. We seek the advice and consent of the Senate. And the President-"
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"The President is President for all four years, isn’t he?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He is. But once an election begins, by implication, it is inconsistent with the constitutional principles, in my view. You get disagreement among scholars on this, but I believe it’s inconsistent when millions of people have already voted to put someone on the Court. I think it should have been held until this election is over, see what the makeup of the Senate is going to be. If the President wins this election, he should be able to go for it."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"But how about that question of expanding the court? Here’s what you said exactly one year ago tonight at a Democratic debate. You said, “I would not get into court packing. I would not pack the court.” That’s not what you’re saying now. Is the nomination of Judge Barrett reason enough to rethink your position?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"What I wanted to do, George, you know if I had answered the question directly then all the focus would be on, what’s Biden going to do if he wins? Instead of on, is it appropriate what is going on now? And it should stay. This is the thing that the President loves to do, always take our eye off the ball what’s at stake. One of the things Pete has suggested is, and there’s a number of constitutional scholars have suggested as well, that there are at least four or five options that are available to determine whether or not you can change the way in which the court lifetime appointment takes place consistent arguably with the Constitution. I have not been a fan of court packing because then it just generates what will happen. Whoever wins, it just keeps moving in a way that is inconsistent with what is going to be manageable."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,So you’re still not a fan?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, I’m not a fan. It depends on how this turns out. Not how he wins, but how it’s handled, how it’s handled. But there’s a number of things that are going to be coming up and there’s going to be a lot of discussion about other alternative as well."
debate,George Stephanopoulus,2020,"What does that mean, how it’s handled? How will that determine [crosstalk 00:23:42]."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"For example, there’s actually real live debate on the floor, if people are really going to be able to have a time to go through this. I don’t know anybody who’s gone on the floor that’s been a controversial justice in terms of making fundamentally or altering the makeup of the court that’s gone through in a day kind of thing. I mean, it depends on …"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"… and the makeup of the court has gone through in a day kind of thing. I mean, it depends on how much they rushed this. And you think about it, George, here you got a lot of people not to be able to pay their mortgage, not being able to put food on the table, not being able to keep their business open, not being able to do anything to deal with what’s going on in terms of the economy as a consequence of COVID and they have no time to deal with that, but they have time to rush this through."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Well, right now it looks like they’re going to have a vote around Halloween. So if they vote on it, [crosstalk 00:48:26] for the election. If they vote on it before the election, you are open to expanding the court?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m open to considering what happens from that point on.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"You know, you said so many times during the campaign, all through the course of your career, it’s important to level with [crosstalk 00:48:41]"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"It is. Good choice. No matter what answer I gave you, if I say it, that’s the headline tomorrow. It won’t be about what’s going on now, the improper way they’re proceeding."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,But don’t voters have a right to know where you stand?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,They do have a right to know what I stand and they’ll have a right to know where I stand before they vote.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,So you’ll come out with a clear position before election day?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yes. Depending on how they handle this. But look, what you should do is you got to make sure you vote and vote for a senator who in fact reflects your general view on constitutional interpretation, and vote for a president who thinks is more in line with you. And if you oppose the position that I would not have appointed her, but if you oppose my position, vote for Trump, vote for Republican who shares that view, but that’s your opportunity to get involved in lifetime appointments that have presidents come and go, justices stay and stay and stay."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"You have a question from a Republican, Andrew Lewis. I would guess a disaffected Republican. You cast a write-in vote for John Kasich in 2016. You’re going to vote against President Trump this year."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"John’s writing in for me, by the way."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,I know that.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I’m sorry.
debate,Andrew Lewis,2020,"Mr. Vice President, my father Drew Lewis served as secretary of transportation under President Ronald Reagan in his first time."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Oh yeah, I’ll be darned."
debate,Andrew Lewis,2020,"And some of his closest allies and friends were Democrats, including House Speaker Tip O’Neill and Senator Ted Kennedy. Sadly, today we have highly partisan and dysfunctional governance. And I believe President Trump is primarily responsible for creating this toxic environment. As president, how will you avoid the temptation to exact revenge and instead take the high road and attempt to restore bipartisanship, civility, and honor to our democracy?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"It was written by a fellow who won the Pulitzer prize for a book he wrote about the presidency. He said I doubt whether Biden is really Irish. He doesn’t hold a grudge. In politics, grudges don’t work. They make no sense. I really mean it. I have never, and the second point I’d make is everybody talks about, “Yeah, Joe, when you were a senator and a chairman of foreign relations or chairman of judiciary, you got a lot of things done. You’re able to cross the aisle but the days are changed. When you’re vice president, you got a lot done, but it can’t happen anymore.” It can. We got to change the nature of the way we deal with one another. And it starts off by the way your father was and Tip was and others. You don’t question another man or woman’s motive. You can question their judgment, but not their motive. We badly needed an infrastructure bill."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, what happens? I stand up and I say, “We need an infrastructure bill, Senator, but I tell you what, you’re in the pocket of the cement industry, but let’s see what we can do.” He can’t get anywhere. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. I learned that lesson a long time ago. I’ve never, even when it’s obvious on its face what the motive is, stick to the subject and listen to the other guy. Listen, what I will be doing as, if I’m elected president and the first thing and not a joke. And you can ask if they’d tell you, your dad’s old friends in the Republican side, I’m going to pick up the phone and call them and say, “Let’s get together. We’ve got to figure out how we’re going to move forward here.”"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Because there’s so many things we really do agree on. And with Trump out of the way, the vindictiveness of a president going after Republicans who don’t do exactly what he says gets taken away. There’s going to be, I promise you, between four and eight Republican senators who are going to be willing to move on things where there’s bipartisan consensus. Last example I’ll give you. After Trump had been elected, named the next president, wasn’t sworn in yet, I’ve been working on a thing called a bill relating to cancer cures. Okay? And it was called the Cancer Moonshot. And I work with a number of Democrats and Republicans. And we had a bill that was about $9 billion that made significant increases in research and development on cancer alternatives, NIH and particularly specific cancer initiatives. And we only had at the time I think it was 111 or 114, whatever it was, votes in the house. I don’t hold any exact number."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And we had fewer than 40 in the Senate, but after he was elected, I got those people together as vice president and we sat down and we worked it out and we ended up getting a pass 396 votes in the house and 94 votes in the Senate. And at the end of the day, because it had to do with the Biden Cancer Moonshot I’ve been working on, Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell stood up and I was presiding officer and moved to name the bill after my deceased son, Beau, who had just died. So, there are ways to bring this together."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,But how about the question of political accountability? Is there some tension between that and bringing people together? Robert Mueller laid out a lot of evidence of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. What would a Biden Justice Department do with that evidence?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,What the Biden Justice Department will do is let the Department of Justice be the Department of Justice. Let them make the judgments of who should be prosecuted. They’re not my lawyers. They’re not my personal lawyer.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"So, you’re not going to rule it in or rule it out?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I’m not going to rule in or out. Well, I’m going to hire really first rate prosecutors and people who understand the law like Democrat and Republican administrations have had, and let them make the judgements, but turning this into a vehicle for your, as if it’s your own law firm, you don’t own that justice department. You pick the best people you can and you hope that what they’re going to do is they’re going to enforce the law as they see it. But can you remember any Republican president going out there or former Democratic president go find that guy and prosecute him? Remember, where you hear that? Or by the way, I’m being sued because a woman has accused me of rape. Represent me. Represent me. Personally represent me in the state of New York on my not allowing my tax returns. What’s that all about? What is that about?"
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,Got to take another break. We’ll be right back.
debate,Speaker 2,2020,"The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the vice president chosen for the- From the constitution center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"And welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden. We’re going to look at the environment right now. We’re going to get a question from Michele Ellison and from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, businesswoman, a social worker. You’re a Republican who’s voted for Democrats, but you’re not sure what you’re going to do this time around. Correct?"
debate,Michele Ellison,2020,Correct. Greetings Former Vice President Biden.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Hello.
debate,Michele Ellison,2020,"Thank you, Mr. Stephanopoulos. In a 2012 report of the University of Pittsburgh’s Institute of Politics fracking was discussed and it is possible implications for the waterways from the Commonwealth to the gulf. Fracking has made the population sick and killed wildlife in Southwest Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and small business development centers have already begun to transition people away from fossil fuels. What industries that are not harmful to human health and the environment are you planning for Southwest Pennsylvania and the nation?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, first of all, I make it clear. I do not propose banning fracking. I think you have to make sure that fracking is in fact not emitting methane or polluting the well or dealing with what can be small earthquakes in how they’re drilling. So, it has to be managed very, very well, number one. Number two, what we have to do is the future rests in renewable energy. The single fastest growing energy source in the world right now, because I’m going to say something that’s going to sound self-serving, but I manage the RecoveryAact and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost per BTU of wind and solar. So now it’s cheaper than coal, is cheaper than oil right now, and it has great, great promise. And it’s also the fastest growing employer in the energy industry."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And so there are a number of things that I would do immediately. Number one, there are well over 100,000 wells that are left uncapped in the region. We could hire 128,000 of these people who are working in the industry to cap these wells and get a good salary doing it now, number one. Number two, we should be moving toward finding the new technologies that are going to be able to deal with carbon capture. So, ultimately, it’s a transition we moved from, to a net zero emission of carbon that we’re still going to be able to use if we find the right technology, some gases, some gas to be able to, if we can carbon capture."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And I think we’re going to be able to move in a direction where by the year 2035, we’ll be able to have net zero emissions of carbon from the creation of energy, energy creation so we can move it by dealing with those. And every time we talk about global warming or the environment, the president thinks it’s a joke and I think as jobs, because what we’re going to have happened is you’ll be able to see now, as I started to say before. I as president is going to invest that $600 billion that we spend in government contracts, only on those things that in fact also are not only made in America, but building an infrastructure that’s clean and new."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And what we have to do is focus on the transmission of energy across the country from areas relating to solar and wind. The reason is that they have not, that has not been mastered yet. I met a lot of people in Silicon Valley. The battery technology is increasing significantly so you’re going to be able to have, for example, solar on your home and a battery the, this by this by this, as I’m showing you here in your basement. So when the sun doesn’t shine for five days, you still have enough energy. So, we’re making significant progress."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"The other thing we’re going to do is provide an awful lot of work. It’s estimated to put close to a million people to work by weatherizing four million buildings and two million homes, because we’ll save tons and tons of energy or billions of barrels of energy over time. And at the same time provide significant employment and a good union wages, prevailing wages."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Let me stick on fracking for a second day. You said you don’t want to ban fracking. As you know, it’s an important issue here in Pennsylvania. Not everyone buys your denial. A member of the Boilermakers Local 154 Shawn Steffee was quoted in the New York Times today saying “You can’t have it both ways.” It says, “You can’t meet your goal to end fossil fuels without ending fracking.” What do you say to people like Shawn who doubt your denial because they think you want to keep that promise [crosstalk 01:04:34]?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"[crosstalk 01:04:34] Boilermaker’s overwhelming endorsement. Okay? So, the Boilermakers Union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went in a great detail with leadership exactly what I would do, number one. Number two, what I would do is I would giving tax breaks and subsidizing oil. We don’t need to subsidize oil any longer, number one. We should stop that and save billions of dollars over time. What I would also do with regard to there’s no, the difference between me and the new green deal, they say automatically by 2030 we’re going to be carbon free. Not possible."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"So, are you for or against it? You say you’re not for it, but in your website, it says you call it a crucial framework, the green deal."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"My deal is a crucial framework, but not the new green deal. The new green deal calls for elimination of all non renewable energy by 2030. You can’t get there. You’re going to need to be able to transition, George, to be able to transition to get to the place where we invest in new technologies that allow us to do things that get us to a place where we get to net zero emission, including in agriculture. I’ve laid out a detailed plan. We should be taking the plan where we allow significant more land to be put in conservation, plant deep rooted plants which absorb carbon from the air and in fact, pay farmers to do it. We can do things like pelletize all the chicken manure and all the horse manure and cow manure, and take out the methane and use it as fertilizer and make a lot of money doing it."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"For example, right now, down in … And people when I say that, they wonder what I’m talking about. The biggest carbon sink in the world is the Amazon. More carbon absorbed from the air diminishing global warming in the Amazon than all the carbon emitted on a yearly basis from the United States of America from all vehicles on all means. So we have to use our imaginations. We have to move in the direction as well providing for electric vehicles. Electric vehicles will save billions of gallons of oil, [inaudible 01:06:38] estimated, not me, Wall street, one million automobile jobs, but we’re lagging me. I mean, we’re not investing. We’re not doing any of the research."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Got to take another quick break. We’ll be right back. Welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden. The next question comes from Mark Hoffman, Center Valley, Pennsylvania, conservative, who voted for Trump in 2016."
debate,Mark Hoffman,2020,"Welcome to Pennsylvania, Mr. Vice President."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Good to be back home. I’m from Pennsylvania.
debate,Mark Hoffman,2020,"Yes, I know. Scranton, right?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,Yep.
debate,Mark Hoffman,2020,"So, pieces breaking out all over the world. Our troops are coming home. Serbia is talking to Kosovo and the Arabs and Israelis are talking peace which I believe is a modern day miracle what’s going on. Does President Trump’s foreign policy deserves some credit?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"A little more, but not a whole lot. We find ourselves in a position where we’re more isolated in the world than we’ve ever been. Our allies-"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Were more isolated in the world than we ever have been. Our allies… Our go it alone, our America first has made America alone. You have Iran closer to having enough nuclear material to build a bomb. North Korea has more bombs and missiles available to it. We find ourselves where our NATO allies are publicly saying they can’t count on us. We’re in a situation as well, where in the far East, we find ourselves, in the Western Pacific, where we’re isolated as well. You have Japan and South Korea at odds with one another. China is making moves. So I would say, we’re find ourselves less secure than we’ve been. I do compliment the president on the deal with Israel recently. But if you take a look, we’re not very well trusted around the world. When 17 major nations in the world were asked who they trust more, who’s a better leader, and the president came in behind both, the international survey, both behind Putin, as well as Xi. And look what Putin is doing. You have bounties on American militaries heads in Afghanistan. They have more people there now, by the way, than when we left in Afghanistan. And we find ourselves in a situation where he’s talked to Putin six times, hadn’t said a word to him. And NATO is on the risk of beginning crack because they doubt whether we’re there. You see what’s happened in everything from Belarus to Poland, to Hungary, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world. And as well as, this president embraces all the thugs in the world. He’s best friends with the leader of North Korea, sending love letters."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"He doesn’t take on Putin in any way. He’s learned the art of the steal from the art of the deal by Xi and China. So I would respectfully suggest, no, there is no plan, no coherent plan for foreign policy. We’ve been most effective as a world leader, in my humble opinion, not just by the exercise of our power. We’re the most powerful nation in the world, but the power of our example. That’s what’s led the rest of the world to follow us on almost everything. He’s pulled out of almost every international organization. He gets laughed at, literally, not figuratively, when he goes to the United Nations. It’s not about the president, per se. It’s about the nation and the lack of respect that’s shown to us."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Want to get one more question in this segment, and it comes from Mieke Haeck. She’s from State College, Pennsylvania. This is your first presidential election that you’re vote in."
debate,Mieke Haeck,2020,It is.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Hi, Mieke. How are you?"
debate,Mieke Haeck,2020,"I’m good. Thank you. I’m the proud mom of two girls, 8 and 10. My youngest daughter is transgender. The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word transgender from some government websites. How will you, as president, reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under US law?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"I will flat out just change the law. Eliminate those executive orders, number one. You may recall, I’m the guy who said… I was raised by a man who, I remember, I was being dropped off. My dad was a high school educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy. And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time. I’m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another. I’m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad. My dad looked me. He said, “Joey, it’s simple. They love each other.” The idea that an 8 year old child or a 10 year old child decides, “I decided I want to be transgender. That’s what I think I’d like to be. It’d make my life a lot easier.” There should be zero discrimination. And what’s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They’re being murdered. I think it’s up to, now, 17. Don’t hold me to that number, but it’s… It’s higher now?"
debate,Mieke Haeck,2020,Yeah.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And that’s just this year. And so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter, or daughters, whichever, one or two."
debate,Mieke Haeck,2020,One.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"One. Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do. None. Zero. And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware. And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general’s office."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,We’ve got one more segment coming up. Thank you.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,And I’m proud of her.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,We’ll be right back.
debate,Speaker 3,2020,"The vice president and the people, a special edition of 2020. Here again, George Stephanopoulos."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"And welcome back to our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden. The next question comes from Keenan Wilson, Narberth, Pennsylvania, Democrat."
debate,Keenan Wilson,2020,"Good evening. You say that you committed to entering this race after the events of Charlottesville in 2017. I assume that that feeling that prompted you to run will not go away once the results are determined. So hypothetically, if you lose, how will you use your platform to urge President Donald Trump, and those rallying behind him, towards the ideals of a more perfect union?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, to be very honest with you, I think that’s very hard. Things have not let themselves to him learning from what’s happened, what’s gone before. Instead of being chastened by being one of the few presidents, the only president to be impeached and then have a member of his own party vote to expel him, it emboldened him. But what I will do… Hopefully, I’ll go back to being a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And making the case that I’ve been made, and at the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, focusing on these same issues, relating to what constitutes decency and honor in this country. It’s the thing that got me involved in public life to begin with. As a kid, I’d moved from Scranton, where there were no African-Americans and moved down to Claymont, Delaware."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"And in Delaware we have the eight largest Black population, as a percent of population. It was an epiphany for me seeing what was going on, and I got deeply involved. I’m no great shakes. I wasn’t John Lewis. I don’t mean to imply that. But it’s the thing that’s motivated… My dad used to have an expression for real. He said, “Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity. Everybody.” And it was real. Everybody is. And so whether I’m a defeated candidate for president back teaching or I’m elected president, it is a major element of everything that I’m about, because it reflects who we are as a nation."
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Every single solitary generation, the dial has moved closer and closer and more and more to inclusion. And we are a country that is a country of slaves who came here 400 years ago, Indigenous people, and everyone else is an immigrant. And we’re a diverse country. And unless we are able to treat people equally, we’re just never going to meet our potential. But I think the American people want to see that happen. I think they’re ready to see it happen. And I’d tell you one thing, if I’m elected president, you will not hear me race baiting. You’ll not hear me dividing. You’ll hear me trying to unify, and bring people together. When I said I was running because I wanted to unify the country, people said, “Well, there are the old days.” We better be able to do it again."
debate,Keenan Wilson,2020,Agreed.
debate,Joe Biden,2020,We’d better be able to do it again.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Mr. Vice President, if you lose, what will that say to you about where America is today?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Well, it could say I’m a lousy candidate, and I didn’t do a good job. But I hope that it doesn’t say that we are as racially, ethnically, and religiously at odds with one another as it appears the president wants us to be. Usually, the president’s in my view, with all due respect, has been divide and conquer. The way he does better if he splits us. There’s division. And I think people need hope. Look, George, I’ve never been more optimistic about the prospect for this country than I am today. And I really mean that. I think the people are ready. They understand what’s at stake, and it’s not about Democrat or Republican. If I get elected, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president. I’m going to take care of those who voted against me, as well as those who voted for me, for real. That’s a presence too. We got to heal this nation, because we have the greatest opportunity to any country in the world to own the 21st century. And we can’t do it divided."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"One more break. We’ll be right back. And we are wrapping up our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Vice President, as you know, President Trump had a town hall meeting tonight, as well. During that town hall meeting, he was asked several times whether he took a COVID test the day of your last debate. You’re supposed to have another debate a week from tonight. Just two quick questions. Do you expect that debate to happen? Will you demand that President Trump take a test that day and that it be negative before you debate?"
debate,Joe Biden,2020,"Yeah. And by the way, before I came up here, I took another test. I’ve been taking them every day, the deep test, the ones that go in most. Because if I had not passed that test, I didn’t want to come here and expose anybody. And I just think it’s just decency, to be able to determine whether or not you’re clear. I’m less concerned about me, but then the guys with the cameras, the people working in the Secret Service guys you drive up with, all those people. And so, yes, I believe he will do that. Look, I’m going to abide by what the commission rules call for. I was prepared to debate him remotely, which was supposed to happen. And he said he wouldn’t do that, a virtual debate, or a town hall. He didn’t want to do that. I didn’t set those rules. The commission set the rules. So whatever rules they set, I’m confident that the Cleveland Clinic is the one overseeing it. I think they’re going to not let happen what happened last time. They’re going to demand that it’s safe."
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,But you expect to be there?
debate,Joe Biden,2020,I expect to be there.
debate,George Stephanopoulos,2020,"Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time tonight. Thanks to all the questioners here. It was really terrific questions. I think you did a service to our democracy tonight. Thank you very much. I want to go back to my colleague, David Muir, in New York."
