## ğŸ“– Dataset: <a name="dataset"></a>

Our dataset, called 'corpus' was created from several existing datasets (e.g., Donald Trump's tweets) and we collected additional data through scraping (on https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu). Then, we reformatted this data to combine it into a coherent set. This is stored as multiple files in CSV format.
